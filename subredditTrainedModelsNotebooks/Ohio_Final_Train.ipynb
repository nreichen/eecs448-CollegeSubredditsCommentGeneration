It will cost you about $60 a day There are some metered spots on the cul-de-sac all of the buildings encircle and there is pay to park in the Kottman Lot and Ag Admin lot. Otherwise, the four lots (behind Kottman/Vet Med), behind animal sciences, across from Ag Admin, and at Ag Admin need a A/B/C pass.

You would have little room for error in your CSE classes. If not I’d take a lighter semester filled with gpa booster Gen Ed’s and focus on 2221. I would also recommend that you do 1223 Java instead of 1222 C++ bc it’s easier and Java is more relevant to 2221. Edit: misread post <eos> ']\n",

Today my cousin came to visit unannounced, and I told him he would be alright to park in a D spot for only a few minutes so he could check out my place. When we got back he had a $50 ticket for not having a permit. I felt bad and told him I would pay it since I told him he could park there.  I am just wondering what would happen if I don't pay the ticket. Since he had no permit, there is no way to track it to me, so I could not get billed. They got his license plate number and car description though. If it does not get paid, will they look him up based on this or just let it go assuming he doesn't get another ticket here? I got one last year for parking over the line in my spot, but was able to appeal it, but this one I don't think could be appealed since the car was blatantly parked without a permit, and it was clearly posted. Any advice is appreciated. I won't be heartbroken if I end up having to pay it, but I just am wondering what would happen if I do not.

The team with the highest record from each division faces off in the Big Ten Championship. Now, this year the best two teams in the Leader division, Ohio State and Penn State, are bowl ineligible, which means IU could have a subpar record and still be on top of their division. A win this weekend against Wisconsin puts both teams at 3-3, with IU holding the tiebreaker. For IU to get to the Rose Bowl, they'd have to beat Wisconsin and make it to the Big Ten Championship, then winning there to be sent to the Rose Bowl (winner of the Big Ten Championship automatically plays the winner of the Pac-12). Ah, I forgot about OSU and Penn St., now it makes a lot more sense! <eos> \n",

You should live at home for two years get good grades at community college then go to better school than you would have gotten in out of highschool and save tonssss of cash. This is honestly the smartest route. It doesn't matter where you start, just where you finish.  I know so many students who started with me at IU, but partied too much, so they went home after a year or two and finished off at like Ivy Tech. Then I know students who went the community college route first and transferred in sophomore or junior year and finished at IU. ... both groups spent around the same amount, but the people who finished with better degree got the better outcome.

My question is how do I sign up for an online spanish course that is offered out of IU East? I tried emailing my adviser but seeing as it's officially winter break, I don't think she's going to get back with me in time. The reason I'm interested in the online class is because I didn't pass HispS200 this semester and have to retake it, however, I already have my set schedule for next semester and I need to take it online. I did some research and found that IU East has Span-S200 (which is the equivalent) 100% online, but it won't let me register for it (I'm assuming because I'm enrolled at IUB). Please help, I need to take this class and I need to take it online and it has to be next semester or I won't graduate on time. TLDR: I need to figure out how to enroll in an online spanish course from IU East while I'm currently attending IU Bloomington.    Do you just say there's a good chance they will allow me to transfer to IU East next semester? Not only that, but I think they'll let me pass hispS200. Thanks for your help.

At least that's what happened with my parking ticket last year. Just appeal the damn thing, it tells you exactly how on the ticket. Since they were visiting, it will probably be granted. If you never pay it, it will be sent to collections which will hurt your cousins credit score. Always appeal, they are usually lenient and will forgive if you are not a repeat offender. Add something about how it was your out of state cousin who is considering applying or your alumni Aunt or there was a tree branch obscuring the sign and they were legitimately confused... <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am by no means an expert, but let me give it a shot. The Big Ten is split up into two divisions now, Leaders and Legends. The team with the highest record from each division faces off in the Big Ten Championship. Now, this year the best two teams in the Leader division, Ohio State and Penn State, are bowl ineligible, which means IU could have a subpar record and still be on top of their division. A win this weekend against Wisconsin puts both teams at 3-3, with IU holding the tiebreaker. For IU to get to the Rose Bowl, they'd have to beat Wisconsin and make it to the Big Ten Championship, then winning there to be sent to the Rose Bowl (winner of the Big Ten Championship automatically plays the winner of the Pac-12). Ah, I forgot about OSU and Penn St., now it makes a lot more sense! <eos> \n",

There's a culinary school in Bloomington, I believe, but IU does not have a culinary program. Occasionally there will be food-related courses but there is typically no cooking involved in that. I've heard of Jewish Cooking, but idk if that's a real thing. I did take an anthro class called Food, Sex, and Gender which was interested and an easy grade but no cooking and little actual food is eaten :/ it was super interesting though.

Music school students live in Read which is by the music school, liberal arts in Collins which is by the arts building, and you'll be on north campus with all the other freshmen CEOs. North campus was known for drinking and partying when I was there. I've heard they cracked down a bit since.  Oh also, everyone can smell when you smoke pot in a dorm room. The classic towel under the doorframe trick is for teens with parents in denial. Find somewhere else to smoke or you'll unfortunately meet some cops and be kicked out of Kelley. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Not sure about that one. Chemistry -- Chemistry building at the Eskenazi Museum of Art we have an amazing Special Exhibition of a contemporary artist named Vik Muniz. Free and lots of fun.  Disclosure: I work there but promise I'd be saying this even if I didn't it's a really cool exhibit You should check out the IU cinema and see if anything is going on Bowling or billiards in the IMU is a cheap thing to do. Also check out what the Union Board or IU Cinema is offering - you'd probably only have to pay for your friend and be free as a student. IU Art Museum has a lot of great pieces. Frank Southern Ice Arena (behind BHSS) is open Saturday night. Lots of good food to check out - Sunday brunch at Collins, IMU Tudor Room, Runcible Spoon, or Village Deli. Nick's English But or Mother Bear's are classics. If you've got something more specific in mind, or limitations of travel around town, I can thin it down a little more. <eos> \n",

Out of the country right now and craving it so bad... Thank you! Hopefully after the show we can get something awesome. But first....drinking! Ha thank you! We are having a complete blast Hello! As a St. Louis and Indiana subreddit follower, this makes me smile. Get nuts, have fun. Nick's Pub has great food and you have to play Sink the Biz. You'll thank me tomorrow. Well, after the hangover is gone. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I checked my email and was on the way to post this The same thing happened to me (but 5 years ago, for what it's worth). I just filled out a short form and that was it; there was nothing to it! I was wondering if anyone else applied and got in at IU rather than before their freshman year. ??? Anyway, at my time, we just came in for an info session, and if you are still interested you just need to fill out a form and wait for their approval. I really suggest applying because it doesn't hurt you and unlocks a ton of cool courses. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> IU has rules stipulating who can and cannot skip the \"dorm stage\" of living on campus (depends on if you transferred from another school, or brought in extra credit, but your military service may exempt you as well). Email your freshman coordinator, or whatever they're calling the position this year (that address should be in your acceptance email), and see if you're eligible to live off campus. If that's the case, and you know anybody who lives in Bloomington or goes to IU that could stand another roommate (or if you want to fly solo), the best way to look for houses with them is to drive around campus and use websites like Zillow to get a good look at property values. The student classifieds (on One.IU) also have a ton of student listings for needed roommates, and you can check there if you want to live off campus and don't mind living with a random student. However, if you're coming in blind, the dorms are actually pretty great way to meet people, and they have 21+ floors (Forrest, et al) that allow booze under certain circumstances so you don't miss out on that. There are dozens of Btown places hiring, depending on what you're looking for. Most restaurants are hiring in some capacity (delivery, grill grunt, bouncer, server). If you don't want to deal with food service, most IU services (ticket office, gym, student union, catering, etc.) also need student help. Most campus-area jobs advertise on the classifieds on One.IU; check there for all the local listings. There's an IU military office as well; they mostly do recruiting stuff but I'm sure the guys there can probably understand your civilian transition woes from a different perspective. Also, if you're into sports, or want to meet new people otherwise, call the ticketing office and get basketball/football season tickets ASAP. This school loves its basketball program perhaps more so than any other thing, and you deserve to catch the team as often as possible. Our football season just started too, so you can catch a few more tailgates before season's end. Extracurriculars outside of that consist mostly of drinking (plenty of bars around town to grab a few Long Islands), working out (Hoosier Heights climbing gym on the south side is a great way to meet some awesome people), food (4th street has tons of international cuisine), parks and nature (Lake Monroe, Griffy Lake, etc. are great places to bring a dog/lady/friend on a hike) and the arts culture (concerts, shows, museums). Good luck! It's an awesome town, and there's so much to do. <eos> \n",

I'm afraid to move out this next summer. :/ HAND (housing and neighborhood development) does inspections of every rental property in Bloomington every 3-5 years. They also do inspections--for free--at the request of the tenant. They write reports describing in moderate detail what is wrong with the property, and give the landlord a timeframe to fix the issue. These reports are often essential in our lawsuits against Bloomington landlords.  You should absolutely come in the SLS. We provide free legal representation to any IU student, and landlord/tenant law is our speciality (for obvious reasons). If you want to meet with me specifically, PM me and I'll give you my name. I do this on a volunteer basis, because I hate seeing kids get screwed.  [url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> CJUS K 300 I took SPEA's stats course. It's difficult but doable. Depends on what your major is though. If you're in the sciences, you're doing yourself a disservice in taking anything but the courses offered in the stats department. If you're anything else, I'd say the CJUS or PSY stats course. From what I hear they're not as challenging as the others. <eos> \n",

You should check it out My roommate works at the Mac Experience and he's sitting right here beside me. He said they won't replace just a screen, but if you have AppleCare Plus they can replace the whole phone for $49. They charge $20 to transfer all your data to the new phone, but you can just backup your phone on your computer yourself for free before bringing it in, then once you get the new phone just \"Restore backup\" through iTunes or iCloud.  If you don't have AppleCare Plus it costs between $150-$250 depending on your model. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I used to study in the law library as an undergraduate occasionally. I think as long as it's not too crowded and you aren't being disruptive it's fine. Dressing a little nicer always helps. During the summer, I think it's much more relaxed. But, generally, the rule seems to be if you're using the books or are a law student, you're safe. I know some grad students who will just grab a book from the shelves and have it open while they work. Often they are successful. The librarians can tell, though, and may kick you out. If it's crowded you are very likely to get get kicked out. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> \"Tuition costs too much, therefore we are going to skip our classes that we have already paid for.\" Makes sense. The biggest part I don't understand is you aren't being forced to go here, and could easily go to a cheaper school and get your degree. Want the best education=pay a little more for it. Simple. I work with one of the people on that list. He comes in at 6am and stays until about 6pm every day (including weekends). He works through lunches or forgets to eat, is extremely helpful and available to his students, and brings in research money off of many grants. He does take off time for vacations with his family but they always coincide with those taken by students. I figure he is working at least 60 hours but could be working more, which would be over 1200 hours than the average IU worker. I understand that you want to throw some people under the bus but take into consideration that those are the same people that are also working hard to make sure you have scholarships, that you are supported as students, and that all the little bullshit that goes along with running the school gets done. I obviously can only speak about one person on that list.  To put it in perspective, I was a PhD student that lost their funding, graduated with only a Masters, and am extremely bummed about it still. Go and have a strike but be sure to follow local and campus laws. I lost a student last semester for having a weapon on him while on campus. Be safe! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, Former member and current alumni president of Straight No Chaser and Another Round. Prepare 2 songs of different styles. It's laid back and the group is all undergrads and they are good guys. They had 30+ people come out and will hope to have the same tomorrow. If you have any questions DM me and I can tell you more about the group. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If you're going into a PhD program unfunded, you have made a horrible mistake, and shame on the program for allowing it. Most graduate programs have funding available for you. However, some Masters programs have very limited funding available. If you are entering a Ph. D program and you have no funding being offered, that is probably a bad sign. If you decide to continue without departmental funding, yeah you are pretty much in side job and loans territory. Which sucks, especially because graduate students no longer get any subsidized loans as a result of the annual government shut down negotiations of 2011. There are some early loan forgiveness programs if you are looking at going into any public sector work. And income based repayment can make large principals very manageable to pay, but unless you have some loan forgiveness plan in the pipe this is a recipe for paying the loan for the rest of your life. Personally, I think there are very few graduate programs that are worth paying for out of pocket, unless you have a very specific and realistic career plan that requires that specific graduate degree. <eos> \n",

I'm sure it happens, but I've never known anyone who's had their bike stolen. Just be smart about where (and how) you lock it up and not leaving it somewhere for months. :) Bikes do get stolen in Bloomington make no mistake. Better safe than sorry every time, always lock your bike. I have never seen an unlocked bike alone on campus! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> [url link] Comedy Attic is 18+ if you're into stand up. They get some fairly big names in there. Bloomington is a great town. I came here 30 years ago and never left. People are friendly and there is always some activity going on related to IU or the city. People of the city and university have a mental attractiveness that you will find enjoyable. Study hard and play safe. IU is a really fun place. You sound like you'll fit in well! I never had to take finite but I've known multiple people to fail it multiple times, so be aware! My best advice is make an effort to be really friendly the first few weeks, especially during Welcome Week when nothing else is going on. Your friends in your dorm will likely be the people you go out and if you are shy or rude in the first few weeks you probably won't have a great time. <eos> \n",

On the other hand it's extremely easy which seems to be what you're looking for. Thanks for the reply, looks like I'm registered for Dierks course unfortunately. But if the coursework is as light as you say, I'll be okay with that. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> **BEATLES** - MUSZ401 with Gass. BEST. CLASS. EVER. Any class with Adj. Prof Gene Coyle, the ex CIA officer has the best stories. Classes for the most part are pretty easy as long as you keep up with reading. I took a human sexuality course through hyper that was really easy and relatively entertaining. Especially the two weeks you learn about Alfred Kinsey. I think what makes it fun is the awkwardness of the whole thing like watching porn in a group setting. My suggestion though is take it with a couple of friends. <eos> \n",

IIRC our residents usually had to meet with a judicial officer (one of the Res Hall professional staff) and for small incidents like these, usually attend a brief a deterrence course, similar to what happens if you were cited by the university for alcohol. [Link to Code of Student Rights  Responsibilities - Judicial Process]([url link] I think it was $50 a few years ago but that may have changed. This was separate from any fines from IUPD.

            "<bos> You won't be kicked out for something like this. I've seen people do worse and dumber things and be fine. They'll most likely charge you some kind of fine and make note of it on your record and that's probably it. RA here, it is very unlikely you will be kicked out or lose a scholarship over something like this. It gets much more serious when there are repeated offenses. The main point of these meetings is to talk to a graduate or full-time staff member who can help you understand what being in a community is all about. They'll also talk to you about any problems you may be having, or anything else on your mind. This doesn’t answer OP’s question at all; I’m sure he/she has heard plenty of this already. You’ll be good dude I had to go to one of those for smoking pot in the dorms (cops arrested me and everything). It was basically a one-on-one meeting with a lady who worked in my dorm (Wright) and she was basically just a counselor and reflected on the incident with me. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> You should email/call the 21st Century Scholars Office. If this is the automatic scholarship for the certain GPA and SAT scores then you just pocket the money if it is more than your costs to be paid to the bursar. That's how mine is. Same situation as you (21st Century and automatic scholarships). I was given $24,493.00 for the school year. This consists of the 21st century scholarship, automatic scholarships, and federal pell grant. You will likely get around the same next year (probably a couple hundred more). The money that is not used in tuition will automatically be used to pay for all costs billed to the bursars account (which includes basically anything payed to IU including dorm and meal plans). Any money that is left over will be dispersed to you (direct deposited into your bank account -- cash). So just keep a total of tuition and fees, room cost, meal plan and make sure it does not go over $25000 and you will be fine. Be aware however that all money that does NOT go towards tuition, should be taxed as income. If you are still a dependent you will end up having to pay over a $1000 in taxes. So plan accordingly. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Did you work with any faculty members on research projects during the years you were at IU? Honestly if you want to do something with machine learning, I'd suggest contacting and meeting with some of the faculty. Your chances for getting into a graduate program are a lot better if you make friends with some of the faculty beforehand, who can then vouch for you during the formal admissions process. GPA, GRE Quant, and recommendation letters are important, but it's the internal vouching from faculty that really distinguishes applicants.  I took Applied Machine Learning with [Sriraam Natarajan]([url link] a few semesters ago - you might want to contact him. He's an exceptional instructor, and genuinely cares about students and the work they do. You should also probably reach out to a couple other folks in SOIC who are working on data science and ML as well. Edit: make sure you do your homework and take time to learn about their research before contacting faculty. Being able to talk about specific projects that interest you, will make it more likely that they'll respond to you. <eos> \n",

If that's the only class you're taking, I think you'll find it very manageable.

            "<bos> The Bluebird doesn't do that, unfortunately. I think it has to do with it all being a bar, and in the state of Indiana you must be 21+ to be in a bar. The Bishop has shows and the bar and stage are in separate rooms, so you can go to the show and be 18+, but just not enter the bar area. Sorry about your luck. Yeah, I don't plan on trying to use a fake ID. Just looks like I won't be able to go unfortunately. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Basketball tickets can be sold via the facebook page called IU Ticket Exchange. Football tickets can't really be sold because you can get tix at the gate for cheap, and they never sell out. As far as the football tickets go, I'm not really sure. You do get physical basketball tickets that you can sell to a friend, or anyone interested. However, they would need a student ID to get in, if the ticket is marked as a student ticket. They don't usually look at them too closely though, so if a friend that doesn't go here wants to get in with a student ticket, he could just borrow someone's ID and shouldn't have a problem. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Your Lab Class will spend the entire next week running exam prep, and your Friday Lecture will also be about the Lab Practical, so there will be plenty of in class time.  * There are the T-Th 7-9pm BU431 hours,  * About 50 hours of office hours a week here: [url link]  * And a Monday Recap session: Mondays from 9:00pm - 10:00pm Location: McNutt 001B lab  There will probably also be a big exam prep session that Thurday night or Friday, so watch the k201 webpage for that. If any of that doesn't work for you, follow the other advice here, and talk to a Peer Tutor. Most of them took the class last semester so it's still really fresh,and they all aced it, so they can talk about their exam prep process, and things they had problems with. Also, email your lab instructor with questions. We're here to help too, and emails can effectively extend our office hours :) -A Lab Instructor <eos> \n",

You only get the 60% discount if you purchase extra points, but even then it's not really a great deal.

Unfortunately, you will not be able to connect to IU Secure with either PS4 or Xbox One (and all generations prior) as neither devices support WPA2 Enterprise, so your choices are going to be pretty limited. If you already have both registered the wireless MAC addresses to DeviceNet and are experiencing these issues (I am assuming high latency?), I would highly recommend calling in to get your ethernet MAC addresses registered to the IU network, as our ethernet connection offers insanely higher bandwidth and will reduce your latency issues. I did, they had no idea. They said they are only concerned with making sure consoles get connected to the network. Have you tried calling / emailing the support center to see if they know of a work around? <eos> \n",

WWU is a great school for the cost, I'm just a bit bummed about not having the 'whole college experience' if I end up there. If that makes sense? I understand. Fly out next year or some year if you have friends that will be at IU and participate in some of the little 500 madness. Its enough for the entire year for some people...

At least a few years back they both fulfilled the same requirement but 170 is much more interesting. They have a wide variety of topics, mine was Comic Books and Adaptation. We read a number of comics that had been made into movies and write papers about the adaptation process. It was very cool. From what I've heard 131 is significantly more basic and vanilla English comp. <eos> \n",

Opportunity for everything, awesome people and great friends After spending this past summer studying abroad with students from universities from all over the country I can without a doubt say that Bloomington and Indiana University are major standouts for how special and amazing the community and social life is.

I don't understand how they think that is okay. The pay schedule is monthly, but it is completely stupid at the beginning and end of the semester. Your first AI paycheck will likely be about 2 weeks into the semester (~2nd week of September). For example, the last time I was paid for a fall semester was 2011, and was paid 15 September, rather than 31 August. <eos> \n",

E bus runs in front of them. It's not Evermann, which is nice. Small rooms, older but functional bathrooms, and nice views. Lots of international and grad students, some families. A pain to move in and out of if you're on the top floor. Since it's IU owned, management can't be beat. <eos> \n",

At least one year but I think 3 years is the actual number. I could be wrong though. The thing you're missing is that you can be a resident of Indiana while still not being a resident for tuition purposes.It's in the FAQ in the link I posted in a previous reply. Look at the [residency page]([url link] There's a link to the policies there. Typically, you have to wait 12 months to establish residency, but there's a specific rule -- 2c -- that allows you to establish residency sooner if you are under 21 and your parents establish residency in the state. However, if you move first and they move after, then your residency in Indiana isn't a result of your parents. Even being enrolled in school before they actually move might preclude you from that exception since it might then be argued that you still only moved for school. They have an email there and you can contact them, but you might want to review the information there first before you say something that will work against you. Edit: The key thing to point out is if that your primary reason for being in the state is school, then you're not a resident. At the moment, it sounds like that's your primary reason. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Have sprint. Pretty happy here in btown but no 4g yet. We are getting a new carrier agnostic tower in September however so I would wait until then and check with peers at that time to make a decision carrier wise. I will say that Sprint is the only remainimg major carrier with truely unlimited data with no metering or throttling so getting in now before that changes might not be a bad idea.

            "<bos> I've lived in Ashton-Johnston for two years. I'll be living in Willkie next year (staff position)  Johnston is a coop building with high school GPA and SAT/ACT score requirements, you do chores, get a cheap, single room with AC with above average students. It's a pretty good deal. Positives of experience: People are awesome, couldn't really be much better.  Close to a bunch of stuff: Wright, Union Street for ibucks spending, Pizza X (Self diagnosed addict of the Lil' 5 deal, breadsticks, two sauces and a drink for 5 bucks), Red Mango (great froyo), Subway right across the street, SRSC couldn't be closer,  Sunrise busstop is great, and there's D parking (lower-tier) right across the street.  Demographically it's a lot more diverse than a lot of other Res Halls. (This is fact btw, IU publishes statistics.) Cons/expected cons: Heating/Cooling in the building was always a bit off. Some rooms would roast, others would freeze. Not too big of a deal though unless you got a really bad room, mine was pretty bad last year because it was the odd room in the hall so it was normally cold, but it bothered people visiting my room more than anything else.  Cockroaches were probably the worst thing. I hate those things. Ugh. Chores weren't really that bad, they weren't a big deal and you'll never make 25 dollars an hour vacuuming hallways anywhere else.  Living in a single really wasn't that bad either, people generally hung out in the lounge and only went to their room to sleep. And the privacy can be really nice when you need it.  OH, yeah, almost forgot. The walls are really thin. So hopefully your neighbors aren't too loud.  General comments about the rest of Ashton- I get the impression that if you're not in a learning community Ashton is pretty lame. Lots of people expressed jealousy of not living in Johnston and the individual buildings don't really mingle that much.  Another annoying thing about Ashton is it always seems to be last on the list for improvements and repairs because it's in the Master Plan (IU's long term planning documents) to tear it down soonish. Granted it's also in the Plan to tear down and replace Assembly Hall :GASP: but still, we're last on the list for stuff.  We don't have a MMM (media library) but Union Street and Teter are right next door. Edit: Formatting. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Typically it is a computer-centric event and the official console stuff is limited (mostly to smash). So I went to the link, but there only tournament game shown is smash bros. What other tournament games are there? And what consoles are they being played on? So what games are being played on the PCs? I don't know for sure. I'm not involved with running it any more. This year people are voting for the tournements. If I had to guess I would say Overwatch, Dota2, LoL, and maybe CSGo or Hearthstone. There are always pickup matches for most popular games though. That sounds pretty sweet! Thanks for the quick response <eos> \n",
            "<bos> DO NOT underestimate the Kelley experience. I was far from the requirement (2.78 in high school) and I pulled my shit together freshman year and got in. I've taken classes in probably 4 or 5 different schools within IU and what I've found is that nothing compares. I took a few computer science classes and was a TA for a semester and really enjoyed my time there but honestly they just aren't run like Kelley classes are in terms of efficiency and speed of learning. That being said, nothing should stop you from pursuing YOUR passion. If accounting is only on your radar for the salary then run away fast because that's the worst reason to work in an industry and there's a high chance you'll end up being miserable in your career. Do what you love and money will (hopefully) follow. Good luck! Probably the biggest mistake you're making at the moment is assuming just being in Kelley is going to get you the high paying job. I'll help you out now and tell you that's not true. If the job is what you want, you have to work and it's not easy if you don't like the classes trust me. Being an average accounting major doesn't get you very far. With that said, take some of the icore prerequisites and at least try and get in. It's way easier to go from Kelley to something else than the other way around. Good luck! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Memorial Hall in Wells Quad has some really nice single rooms. Private bathrooms, AC, $10k price tags, the works. The downside to Wells Quad is that it's very food starved. The closest food court is Goodbody and they have an extremely limited food selection and no weekend hours. Meaning you have to walk to either Forest or Wright. Wilkie is the closest C store as well. Wells is right on third and you could eat at the restaurants down at third and Jordan but that takes real money.  If you're wanting to have a car next year, there aren't CH spaces at Wells you need to get an Atwater garage permit, Atwater Garage is a 2, 3 minute walk from Wells. And getting to and from the garage can be a bit tricky cause it's situated between two one way roads and the entrance is also on a one way road. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> If you're in Kelley or SICE, expect to add an extra year to your studies. I'm sure you've gathered from the website the info about the summer intensives and internships in China. I'm not in flagship but they recruit hard from the Chinese classes, so I've heard their spiel several times. You'll have a lot of required events and tutoring sessions to go to. Depending on what level you are they may or may not be all that helpful to you. On the other hand there are social activities and you get to know the faculty pretty well. Do you actually become proficient in Chinese? Absolutely. But you should definitely be sure whether or not you're all in for the challenges before you commit. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Rush is being restructured this year so that everyone must visit each chapter, very similar to sorority rush in the winter. This is different from before where men would just rush the chapters they wanted, leading to a lot of polarization in the Greek system.  For advice, **talk to as many people as possible!!!** Going Greek isn't about trying to get into *that* chapter, it's about finding a group of men that you blend well with and can see yourself building yourself as a better man right alongside with them! I'm Greek, and love every minute of it. There are aspects of Greek life that are already negative stereotypes, true, but it takes men of caliber and drive to dedicate themselves to change IU Greek Life for the better. I'm sure you'll find a place that feels right for you, brother. That all being said, if you end up rushing and don't get a bid to the chapter you wanted, **don't let it get ya down!** Remember, each chapter has hundreds of men rushing, and it's nothing personal. So many people have been just devastated from not getting into the chapter they wanted, and it's so sad to see. I rushed my freshman year, and didn't get the chapter I wanted. However, it all worked out for me, because I'm now (after rushing again sophomore year) in the fraternity that truly is the best fit, and had I gotten that bid to the first choice, I never would have been in the amazing spot I am now. Anyways, I'll step off my milk carton now. Welcome to IU, mate, and above all else, have fun!! EDIT: Feel free to PM me for any more questions/advice/yadayada <eos> \n",
            "<bos> yes, it was the spring football game yesterday afternoon I think there was a football game. They usually do fireworks at the stadium for those. I've lived nearby for a few years, and that's usually what's going on when I hear them. However, I was at LAN war myself, so I'm going off of previous experiences and a google search (google confirmed some sort of football game yesterday). <eos> \n",

Almost all the major apartment complexes will do roommate matching (10th and College, Park on Morton, etc). Don't live in Smallwood. All depends on your price range ^ valid Yeah as a transfer you get more say in where you go and who you get as a roommate than a freshman does. There's a LOT of singles available. I lived in Ashton which is like eight buildings of only singles (not a very social crowd though because it's only singles, lots of international students and hyper academic students, nice people though). Depending on what you like, some of the learning communities are pretty rad too - some of them are kind of shitty though so it's a case by case thing. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> It sounds like you received one of the highest available admission-based scholarships. The odds of them giving you more money is slim, however the scholarship website says \"Students who meet the November 1 deadline may submit updated SAT or ACT scores until January 15, 2014 for additional scholarship consideration. \" Apply to the Hutton Honors College (if you haven't already done that or were automatically accepted, I forget how it goes now). It's not really a big deal except that they will sometimes give you money. There is also an office for scholarships. Email someone. The worst that could happen is \"no\". I've heard of people (well more of their parents) who have argued with the university over money and came out ahead. (More specifically, a friend from high school who has some pretty stellar stats but didn't get a Wells or anything like that's dad called the Honors college and said she was thinking about going to a different (and much higher ranked) school if they didn't bump her scholarship up to full tuition. They did, she went to IU). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I really liked it. Had a job lined up before I graduated, working in Silicon Valley for a startup in a very competitive niche and I feel prepared / capable and ultimately very grateful for my time at IU.  I don't know why the other poster said no ties to industry or no research... the CS/Informatics career fair is huge and has tons of big names in the industry. Research wise there are always tons of amazing projects going on in distributed computing, computer vision, etc. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> You’re being a little harsh on yourself. IU only counts IU classes towards your GPA. Just retake the class in person this time. Speaking from personal experience, classes are much easier the second time around. As far as I know no. I transferred some credits and they showed up as T for transfer credit on the transcript. No associated class score and no GPA. So you won't be able to transfer finite since you failed but it probably won't kill your GPA or even do anything.  Edit: Unless it was some IU related thing. I took an IUPUI class and that directly transferred over and had a GPA impact. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Do not get a meal plan if you do not have to. Why? Because you can just pay with your debit/credit card for any food on campus. If you buy the meal plan, they *say* you get a 60% off discount. So a $10 meal is $4 in meal points. However, you are not saving any money. IU charges a Operations Cost fee when you buy a meal plan that is 60% added to the total cost of the meal plan (for example, a $2000 meal plan costs $3200 to purchase). The only time this is not the case is whenever you buy the huge meal plans ($4500+).  There are the small I-BUCKS plans, but the return on investment is very small and you lose any money you don't spend by the end. The food is generally expensive. If I feel like eating a burger with fries and a drink at a place near my class, it'll run me about $13.50. Eating off-campus or preparing your food will always be cheaper. <eos> \n",

But I think that was about it. I guess this goes against what other people have said, but I just graduated and never found my honors advisor to be all that helpful. Once you get in with the department you major in, you'll likely find an advisor that will be more helpful and geared towards your needs. As far as perks of the honors college go, you really just get a nice little tassle to wear at graduation and note to put on your resume saying you were in Hutton. The college also hosts events that you can go to such as movie screenings, talks, luncheons, and dances. I wasn't too involved with Hutton, but if you're into that it's a fine community. The best thing about the college is that they give out tons of grant money. I've gotten lots of money from them to pursue out of class projects- take advantage of it and apply to a ton of grants! Also pro tip I've learned from living on an honors floor freshman year: while it's awesome to be accepted, don't let it get to your head that you're in Hutton. Many people I knew tried to brag about it and ended up looking kind of silly. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> 11 credit hours means you aren’t considered a full time student which can mean you lose scholarship money among other things. If you really want to drop it, I’d pick up a second 8 weeks class to bump up the number of hours you’re taking.  I’d reconsider dropping it though. A C isn’t terrible and you could bring that grade up by the end of the semester. And as long as you don’t make it a habit, one C isn’t going to destroy your gpa when you end up taking 120 or so credits to graduate. Totally your choice, but retaking a class is sort of a pain and you might be able to recover this grade. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My best suggestion is to contact the bursars office. Unfortunately the university could be charging you for any number of things. I am not specifically aware of any charge that is regular and may pertain to your situation. Email this to Student Central (Behind Eigenmann) or walk-in if you have a lot of time to wait. If you email them they usually respond within 24 hours. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Maybe chill out on the talking down on people and have a beer. That could be the issue with meeting people, by boxing everyone in as all the same you aren't giving anyone a chance. Everyone parties, it doesn't mean everyone is the same. Freshman year and friends is a giant mix of people who are all totally DIFFERENT. All you share in common is that you are freshman and live in the dorms. Cultivate these friendships because you are going through the same things, but you will find people you prefer.  By the time junior/senior year rolls around you will have your own group of friends who you share experiences and things in common with, while your casual Freshman friends/roomate will be WAY different and you describe them to everyone else as \"your friend from the dorms.\" <eos> \n",

That's the reason all the alarms have the plastics cases over them that buzz if you remove them. Northwest is very social. Try Teter or Wright. Lots of people are social and friendly. Hope it gets better! I believe a few weeks ago there were over 20 something alarms in five days. Something something axe body spray and frat pledges. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I worked there all of last year (my sophomore year) and I loved it! You work two 4-hour shifts a week plus two weekend shifts every other weekend and I never felt overwhelmed or anything. There's different areas that you can be assigned to work by the student supervisors including deli, prep, cashier, and sometimes when there's a lot of students working they'll have you do some random stocking. Working the deli is probably where you'll start when you're new but it isn't too bad after you learn what's in every sandwich. There's menu cards right above the ingredients in case you forget which is nice. It does get pretty busy around lunch and dinner times but more often than not there's multiple students working so it's not terrible. Deli was probably my least favorite thing to do because it gets really hot and you end up smelling like burnt sandwich. Prep is the most fun in my opinion because you're in the kitchen and can listen to music and talk shit with your coworkers. Tbh the supervisors pick their favorite students to work here so get in with them and you won't have to do much hard work. Some nights when I closed the people working prep and the student supervisors would stand around for literally hours just talking and pretending to put away dishes. Cashiering is fine but it can get extremely boring when there's no one in the store. If you don't want to do it then don't go through the micros training (you really don't have to). I only worked afternoon and closing shifts so I don't know if all of this applies to opening shifts. Let me know if you have any questions! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm looking forward to a new Informatics building that reflects our actual awesomeness. You know, as opposed to two former frat houses haphazardly connected.... Honestly, I love the current charm. Two (one) of my favorite buildings on campus. I might sound like a nerd (well undoubtedly now that I said this), but you can actually read about all of this in the \"Master Plan\" (which is what that model depicts). [url link] To me it blows my mind they want to renovate Ballantine and make it into a science building complete with labs and such. It is exciting to think of things like Fiji getting torn down, as I feel like that belongs on the extension or something, not in between academic buildings. Also it makes me happy is Swain is to be renovated. It's neat that Sycamore/Morrison and those buildings in that area which were originally a quad (and a really cool looking one, arguably neater looking than Collins) will be returned to dorms. As for the buildup of Law lane, and especially Woodlawn, I don't think it's a bad idea. I think it would be nice to develop that area more, as it stands Geology and Informatics seem distant from campus, it only makes sense to develop there. Maybe we can cut down on traffic and make it actually feel like a part of campus. By then food will deliver itself! Science! FYI: Master Plan: [url link] Recommendation on Law Lane: [url link] page 58 Also, from somewhere in 2008 or 2009 there's video of a City Council meeting ([url link] where the IU Strategic Building plan is explained. (I couldn't find the specific date, but a search of council minutes on the city site should help) None of this is final, and one of the options mentioned in the Council meeting is making 10th st one way one direction and Law Lane / 14th st. one way the other direction, similar to 3rd/Atwater. One thing becomes clear once you view these sources. If IU continues to grow, the present configuration will become increasingly difficult, and all options involve trade-offs. Not agreeing or disagreeing, but if you have better options than what is being considered, present them the the University Architect's office. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I agree with the first semester but E202 and M119 are not classes you want to take if you're not admitted yet. Especially at the same time as A100 and W131.... That's a lot of studying. They're all pretty easy if you study. 1st semester take K201, C104, and E201 (not with Prof. Self) - then do A100 second semester (rough 1st 8 weeks for some people) and E202, W131 (be careful, not easy to get an A), and M119 1st semester take:  * K201 (time consuming) * E201 (not super difficult, try to get Olson) * Kelley Compass 1 (BUS-T175). This class is ridiculously easy. You honestly have to put effort into failing. However, some of the projects are more time consuming than they appear at first glance.  * whatever gen eds you feel like taking. 2nd semester take:  * A100 (Take it during the second half. Moves very quickly so stay on top of it)  * G202 (Easyish. I recommend Steve but his wife is good too.) * M118 (If Jim Hendrickson is writing the midterm and final then take his class otherwise try to avoid him. This is probably going to be your hardest class so if it feels like too much early on then sign up for CTS's B or Better Program if you can afford it.)  Also for second semester you should consider taking L201 if you can get Michael Engber. L201 is closed to freshmen during first semester but I'm pretty sure you can take it during second semester. Double edit: You can consider taking K303 after you take K201. The grade distribution is generally pretty solid but it depends entirely on who your professor is if I'm being honest. <eos> \n",

But if you are willing to put a little more effort into it, you could have a decent chance as you would anywhere else just as there are grads from Berkeley who are abysmal at coding... just don't expect there to really be a large contingency of people both wanting to do the same and work for it.  TLDR just come here because you probably won't be as stressed as you would at UIUC and the opprtunities are there if you work for it. <eos> \n",

For example, I skipped over finite math, English Comp, and 100-level French. This meant I got into my school (School of Informatics and Computing) after one semester in UD. So yes, they count.

            "<bos> Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely but you never know. I used to work in the admissions office and if you don't meet the criteria, you don't meet the criteria. There are just too many applicants with unique circumstances to consider each one individually and in aggregate. However, if you feel that you have a strong case for not meeting the GPA requirement then it is worth a shot. They do review applications thoroughly so the process should be fair. Also a 3.6 with 10-15 AP classes is viewed differently than a 3.6 with 1 AP class. There is a reason why the direct admit criteria requires both a high test score and GPA. It's tough to get it... I would still apply and see what happens. What do you have to lose? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I dunno, dish soap in the fountain seems pretty fucking douchebaggy. Why not just stick to the tried and true perpetual binge drinking and hunt to bang some slutty girl that's too drunk to say no?

            "<bos> You should check the credit transfer service online! It will tell you what you can take for credit for each class! Personally, I would say take calc 2 through Ivy Tech, because you've obviously already taken Calc 1 and you have the background for it. Finite is whole new world with completely new concepts I doubt you've seen before. If you're looking for what's easier I would believe Calc 2. That being said if you don't want a semester long struggle with M118 taking it at ivy tech is a great option Try transferring to ivy tech Why would you take M118? It fills basic skills requirements and is a minor requirement in a few programs. I think everyone one of these except Informatics accepts calculus or linear algebra in place of M118. The material is interesting in M118, and it's highly useful in day to day life if you're creative enough to see it, but it doesn't open doors for future study the way calculus will. Take the stronger courses. With a calculus background you have fulfilled a useful requirement for a lot of the most career/salary oriented majors, and kept the door open to take more math courses if you need. Calculus is essential for all sciences, Also for Computer Science, Economics, and others. It will prove valuable in areas like visual arts, especially computer graphics, animation, and loads of other subjects. I recommend that you use your education requirements to open doors, not just as obstacles to get out of the way. While I'm offering my opinion, I might suggest you drop the idea of taking it at Ivy Tech. At IU, your courses are taught by people with much greater expertise, who can offer their insights as part of the instruction. You'll learn more, and open more doors. If you insist on taking the direction you mention, I believe that most Ivy Tech campuses teach an M118 that transfers to IUB, something that was mandated by the State several years ago. (There may be a few counterexamples.) It's your education to waste. You won't regret it if you learn to see every course you take as an opportunity, and not a burden. Smart people learn that with hard work, they're smart at everything they study, and everything they do. <eos> \n",

Starts at 7.50 an hour, .50 promotion after like two months, then there are two positions above that each with a $1 pay raise. Very easy, very nice job. Can my freshman theater major girlfriend do that job? It sounds kinda perfect. absolutely. Badass. Thank you. Where's the back stage office? I've only ever been in one of the ground-floor rehearsal rooms Friday, August 17th at 1-3pm in the IMU (Alumni Hall), there is a part time job fair for non-work study students. Might find something there?  I've only heard of this job and I don't know anyone who works it, but there is this thing called the IU Alumni Association Telefund. You call random people (basically, telemarketing), asking for people to donate to the Alumni Association. Sounds pretty easy to me.  RPS also has the video places in the dorms, if you want to avoid food service (which I'm trying to do. I am tired of Subway.)  Unfortunately, all the good jobs on campus such as working in the library (I've heard you basically get paid to study and do homework, maybe help a few people during your shift with easy tasks) are reserved for workstudy. If you want, you can try to appeal the decision for workstudy. It's worth a shot; all you do is send an e-mail stating you would like to appeal the decision to not grant you workstudy at the end of this month. (fws@indiana.edu). I know a few workstudy students...and I envy their jobs. <eos> \n",

That's really helpful, actually. Thank you! Was there quite a bit of room/floor space or did it seem a bit crammed? It definitely didn’t feel crammed to me. I regularly hung out in there with my suit mate and two of our friends who also lived in Willkie. Thanks man! You could possibly take a look at the two-bedroom apartments in Wells Quad and see if any are still available. They're about the same cost as Union St. I couldn't find any of those when I logged into the housing renewal page -- were there any open? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> #OccupyKelleySchoolOfBusiness I'm all for any kind of protesting, but I don't think any meaningful change is going to come out of Bloomington, IN. The protestors in Bloomington, IN look like a bunch of homeless, disorganized hippies and should be expected to be treated and portrayed as such. exactly my point. I definitely admire them for standing up, but I'm afraid it's not going to accomplish anything. Corporate control of America is so ingrained that any kind of peaceful protest is destined to fail. The media is controlled by the corporate influence being fought against, they're not going to help us. They will just influence the people ignorant of that movement and cause them to continue fighting against their own interests. Now that winter is coming the movement is going to run out of momentum. The protestors aren't going to make it through the winter out there. They can't have campfires or space heaters. The rich can easily just wait it out.  There's going to have to be a catalyst for change. I think it's going to be violent. Protestors are being told to follow Gandhi's example and use nonviolence, but that's only going to get them so far. Those in power never willingly give up power.  I think the most we can do here in town is to offer solidarity and send donations to the protestors camping out near Wall Street. <eos> \n",

He doesn't respond to emails quickly so go to his office first thing Monday. :) Alright thank you. I enrolled into the course (INFO-I391) a few days ago after he told me to do so but I checked my class schedule again today and realized that it was no longer in my schedule. I was afraid that I got kicked out so I started emailing him and asking around lol. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> IU is a T1 research school. Pretty much all of our STEM related majors are top notch (in a global aspect).  However, if you are comparing us to say...MIT, ya, we look inferior, but only in the finest of details, and it's pretty easy to see those rankings these days. If that's all you care about and have infinite amounts of money, you may wish to consider elsewhere... but IU has great programs, just not the world's absolute best. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> While I don't know if you'll need a refresher, definitely take this course seriously. It's the only C+ I got during my college career (though taking it at 8:30am Freshman year wasn't the best choice.) I'm going to back the \"take it seriously\" comment. Not a lot of people get A's in IU math classes, and often only about a third of students in a class get an A or B. Whether or not you're prepared for Calc II material, the IU Calc I class was probably more rigorous than your highschool class, and many of the students taking Calc II (with whom you will in some sense be competing for a grade) will have that stronger background than yours. Of course, you can attend the first couple lectures before making a final decision, and it you're unsure that might be a good strategy. <eos> \n",

They should have contact info for the president our whoever and maybe meeting times. But this is only if they registered through the university to make themselves an \"official\" club (most clubs do because it has a lot of perks). <eos> \n",

It’s expensive, but most options in Bloomington have inflated housing prices. I lived in Spruce and Union Street Apartments when I lived on campus. In my opinion, The Dillon beats both of them. I’d recommend checking it out.  Pros:  - frequent shuttles to campus/downtown - Friendly staff - On-site gym - Pool  - Frequent events  - Internet included - Furnished - close car parking - guest parking - free printing  Cons: - I’ve felt maintenance can be slow at times - Gym equipment can feel limited - Package pickup; need to know if you’re receiving large mail. Won’t be notified via email, etc. <eos> \n",

Roller derby ( although not officially gay) is a great place to meet open minded peeps...as well as the fact that most of BHRG is gay.

            "<bos> Im pretty sure they look at the weighted GPA for Kelley and yours is very high, plus that great ACT score, so you don't really have to worry. I heard letters of rec are only considered if you are on the border but you exceed all expectations. Thanks! That's good to hear. Thanks. I guess I'll apply early and hope to hear good news lol. I was told that it's often much harder to get into a flagship state school if you're Out of State, especially if you want financial aid at a public university so I was worried I might need significantly higher scores. Your score will most likely qualify you for maximum amount for Dean scholarship, which is like around 9000-11000. Also I don't think being Out of State affects you in any significant way at all. Well, the goal is to hopefully avoid paying that much. Regardless of how much it'll cost, I won't have to pay a cent. It's mainly a guilt/conscience thing in that I don't want to force my parents to shell out a huge amount of money for IUB, which is already hard enough to convince them to like. (They're typical Asians in that they like schools with a huge prestigious name they can talk about with their friends.) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> any interest in programming? check out the variety of csci-a290 courses that are available. They're great. LSTU - Almost all of the Labor Studies classes are online, three credit hours. There are a bunch that meet for six weeks or less, and some one credit ones for four weeks. Not sure if it's being offered this year, but my freshman year I took a Languages of the Lord of the Rings 8 weeks class. It was really interesting and suuuuper easy. I love the professor. Some semesters he offers a Languages of Harry Potter class instead. Look it up! LING-L210! Look it up! Even it's a different topic, it should be interesting <eos> \n",

I believe the campus minimum wage is now $10.15 an hour. The one with the shortest line. If your in the sciences the chem teaching labs are a great one. There is def high demand. Don’t have a clue on percentages though IU minimum wage is 10.15/hour, so anywhere on campus! The libraries and rec sports are great.

Try the mo mos, the most popular Tibetan dish. Upvote for Little Tibet shutout, but the owners would be very displeased to hear you describe their Tibetan cuisine as \"Chinese\". They are very politically opinionated about the Chinese intervention in Tibet. The owner even sat down at my table and talked to me after I asked why he started a restaurant in Bloomington. Turns out he escaped when he was young, and hasn't been able to go back ever since. Most of his family still lives there. He started a restaurant to keep Tibetan culture alive and to spread awareness about the issues in Tibet.  They also offer Thai selections on their menu. <eos> \n",

Some schools do not count ivy tech classes, even for some prerequisites.

I have only attended a couple classes at Purdue (and that was only with friends) and can't really compare IU to Purdue. Yeah, which class is it?  Agreed, how can we compare the faculty if we've only ever attended IU? Besides, their academic specialties are so different (STEM vs liberal arts/business/music/education) it'd be apples and oranges.  How can we compare the facilities if we've only been to one school? You should include an \"I don't know\" answer for these, otherwise your results are going to be inaccurate because people have to guess. By facilities do you mean the physical state of the buildings, or how many amenities they offer (number/quality of computer labs/libraries/gym etc.)? <eos> \n",

There will likely be signs posted around there to mention the date they start enforcing. CH lots are ticketed in August I purchased a permit for both semesters last year and didn't have an issue with the valid date. It was also mailed to me within 2-3 business days. My roommate went to the actual parking operations office and I'm pretty sure he was able to get his permit the same day. I would recommend that because then you can at least for sure get your questions answered. Either way, contacting them in some fashion would be your best option :) <eos> \n",

Unix is typically easier to work with for most common programming languages, so macOS tends to have fewer hurdles than Windows.

It's got the best selection (not great quality or good for your money... but if you have a meal plan it's the best right now). I have no clue, but don't try Big Red because they always want two forms and question you about them. Go to Soma. It's a pretty jock free zone, plus their coffee is good and sitting on the patio is rad. Also, you might be able to sneak into House bar by going to the patio out back first, not that I would ever advise doing anything illegal.  The Bishop is the only place I think you can get in under 21 (except Rhinos... but that's just a joke). It's a bit disappointing until you turn 21. <eos> \n",

Beyond that, Bloomington is a great city where just about anyone can find their fit.

They took me into the shop to show me what was wrong with the car (serpentine belt issues on a car where that's a pretty expensive fix) and were not at all condescending (I'm a 20-something female). I was told that the mechanics there work at a flat hourly rate, which I think is pretty uncommon. That keeps them from wanting to tack on extra repairs for commission. <eos> \n",

Getting my masters here now. Loved the school. I wouldn't trust a review site too much. What major are you interested in? I loved IUB and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in one of their well ranked programs. But if you're looking at some cons here's a few off the top of my head. Heavy drinking culture, as in kids die every year from drinking too much. Be careful and watch out for your friends. Some programs are not well ranked, it isn't a catch all school. Huge classes (100-250) make it difficult to interact with professors in the entry level classes, though the class sizes do get much smaller as you progress (15-20). Parking on campus is challenging.  My biggest complaint would be the academic advisers that you get assigned. It felt like they were encouraging me to make poor decisions in regards to fulfilling my degree requirements. Almost like they were trying to make me take longer than 4 years... Worse than useless in my case, be prepared to take accountability for knowing what you have to do to graduate and planning it all out. <eos> \n",

I'm in the same boat but only need one more course. I took Folk F-121 for the first one with prof Shukla (sp?). For the most part a decently easy class, only one 3 page paper, a couple not very hard tests, and some attendance and I think quiz points.

BCL does have a sublet option (more to cater to members than people looking for subleases) but there's a maximum time of three months, which would not be suitable for the OP. Longer than that requires membership. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This is the honors version of intermediate micro... it's basically going to be a tougher version of E321, which most people think is tough.  I will say that E321 wasn't so bad; it just required people to focus and attend class, but a lot of people are lazy and don't want to do that.  If you're an honors student, then you're probably where you should be. Just make sure you keep up with the homework whether it's graded or not. Also, draw the models on your own multiple times... it's not enough to just see them in the book... drawing them out yourself helps really commit them to memory.  Good luck! Honestly, intermediate micro was one of my favorite courses. <eos> \n",

They're definitely worth the cost for the experience (for bball at least). Football games can be fun too if you find a group of friends to join you. You will be asked if you want to group your bball tix with some friends at some point in September or early October. I expect the bball team to be pretty good this year so that should make the games more exciting. <eos> \n",

Parking on Wylie is free west of Henderson.  On the north side parking on 11th between Woodlawn and forest is free. Parking along cottage grove between the psych building and Woodlawn is free.

From what I'm told, the management company is good to deal with, and very fair when it comes to move out inspection, which is somewhat rare in this town. People I know who live there say it's relatively quiet as well, and in decent condition. If I didn't have one pet more than their pet limit, I would rent there in a heartbeat.  I don't know much about Grant Properties, but I used to rent an apartment around the corner from Lincoln Hill Apartments. The location is close to campus and anywhere downtown you want to be, which can be convenient. It was, however, loud a lot of times (nights, weekends). I'm moving into heritage apartments in 2 weeks, I've also heard good things. I agree that's it's a bit far to walk, and I haven't yet looked into the bus system. I plan to drive to campus daily, or walk when it's nice. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I lived in the GV last year, and honestly it kicked ass. At first I was kind of skeptical about what I had got myself into, but once I met a group of people I really clicked with it was so much fun. Like Oedipus said, definitely a gay friendly place. There are people there who are kind of your typical anime nerds that lack all social skills, but there are also some of the most interesting and awesome people I've ever met that live there. There's also everything in between. Most everyone is really intelligent there too, which is refreshing. Like every time I'd smoke with my GV friends, we would get into some conversation about the nature of culture and its effect on critical thinking skills. Whereas with everyone else, we would just spend a half hour deliberating on where to get food. So I say live in the GV. You won't regret it. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Take macro over the summer with Ivy Tech. Easiest to do I second this. I took micro and macro at Ivy Tech. Saves a lot of money and the classes are easier. (from what I've heard) I'm taking honors macro w Buffie rn and it is a breeze. He is fascinating and thorough, so it is not easy because there's nothing to do. It is easy because he is a great instructor who is happy to clarify or elaborate at any time. It is also test based, and they aren't cumulative. I'd still recommend taking it online through IvyTech. I took it the same summer as an internship and it requires literally under an hour of work each week. <eos> \n",

As long as you have a handle, the shenanigans are dependent on your imagination God I wish I hadn't graduated. Last year and the year before where the best for this. Both were at my house. My junior year I lived *directly* across the street from Forest and senior year just a little ways down from that house. Watching the Freshman move in is perfect entertainment for porch drinking <eos> \n",

If the floor RA won't deal with it then you can go over their head and talk to a Graduate Supervisor, or someone who is working the front desk. If that doesn't work then you can talk to your residence hall manager about it. The floor RA has talked to them several times at this point and they just make fun of him as soon as he leaves. I think I'll go to the residence hall manager later today and let him know what's happening. I confronted them this morning and they basically told me that it was going to keep happening and to get over it. They have been cited for alcohol already. <eos> \n",

Chocolate moose is about to get torn down so you should go there for some ice cream. <eos> \n",

They'll also give you as many cardboard boxes as you need for free if you just call them or go to a truck (usually parked by the dorms during move-out). Not aware of any similar competition, but given my positive experience with them over the summer I would definitely recommend them. <eos> \n",

There are lots of metered spots close enough to the stadium if you don't mind walking (around 11th and College Ave.) or you can always take an Uber from your parked car. You can park game day in the stadium lots for $20. It's $10, and [here's]([url link] a map showing which gates to enter. <eos> \n",

Have someone be there with you as a witness. Take walk out pictures/videos. Assume everything either is, or will later be, evidence. I grew up in Bloomington and lived in apartments in Bloomington. I've never not either sued or been sued by a landlord for damages/deposit. If you're going to live in an apartment, read up on landlord/tenant law. (IIRC IN-35 is the chapter.

            "<bos> Dude. I have. Unless you have absolutely no other options, back out and get away as fast as you can. Let me tell you a story. So my roommates and I had been renting a place for a couple months from Pendragon, and apart from the regular gas/power/cable bills that came in every month, we also got a water bill. Not addressed to any of us, but to Pendragon. No big deal, we sign the check, send it in, no big deal. Then a little while passes and I realize I haven't seen a water bill in a while, so I go to check our mail (we were meticulous about keeping it organized) and lo and behold, no bill to speak of. I think this is weird, and decide I'm going to give the water guys a call. The *next day* we get a notice on our door saying we're getting evicted for not paying the water bill. We had paid all of our rent in a timely fashion, had paid all of our other utilities, but the water bills (that we hadn't been getting) had not gotten paid, so they were evicting us. As you can imagine, we were surprised, so we called up Pendragon to explain the situation and find out *they had been receiving the water bills the whole time and just hadn't sent them to us.* And because we hadn't paid the bills we hadn't gotten, we were getting evicted. It was only by threatening to sue them for malicious business practices that we managed to get them to back off. This, unfortunately, was only one of many instances of bullshit we had to deal with. There were dozens of others. I'm moving out of this place in August, and absolutely cannot wait. tl;dr: Don't get fucked, don't rent from Pendragon Properties. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Posts like this piss me off and I have commented before on them. As a Kelley grad I take pride in my degree, not because it was easy, but it trained me well for the real world. If you are interested in finance...then do that. Problem solved. All of the degrees at Kelley are challenging in their own way and that's why it is one of the best business schools in the country. If you want to do something easy then find something else to study. <eos> \n",

Additionally depending on what you're looking for, you might want to talk with some people in Telecom if you haven't already. Check out [Indiana All Media]([url link] a group of students from different mediums working on projects together. If the group as a whole isn't helpful, there are several members always looking for new projects to work on. That being said, shoot me a PM and I can list some ways I may personally be able to help during production. I do have a cinematographer and audio person, but we definitely need some more hands to help out! Maybe lighting? And yeah I've been talking to some people there! At the moment I believe I'll wait and see what happens with the office I'm talking to. If you haven't already, you can always reach out to the people of IFN - the Indiana Filmmakers Network. Unfortunately, the Bloomington chapter is pretty inactive, but there are amateur filmmakers around the state who could offer advice. Or free/cheap help with the production - but if you already have professional personnel, you probably have that all figured out.  Speaking from experience, crowd-funding is very difficult. You gotta hustle the crap out of social media. So I wish you the best of luck! And I'm curious, what office at IU would you potentially be receiving funds from? <eos> \n",

I got in the same bit of trouble and all the made me do was pay a $50 fine, have an appointment with a university official (which was actually a lot more relaxed than I thought it would be), and then do an online \"seminar\" where at the very end it made me promise that I had deleted all the torrent software along with any stolen material. Perhaps they've changed the system since last year, but those are the only things I had to do... <eos> \n",

It's very over priced and the owner takes advantage of the students using their parents' money. The management is horrible and there are tons of better options. We got extra bills for using too much water. I would recommend looking at houses on craigslist since they're less expensive and closer to campus. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Get the smallest meal plan and add on points later if you need to. I'm on my phone, so I can't show you the math, but basically getting the smallest meal plan and adding points is the exact same as getting the regular meal plan except you aren't locked in. Also the 60% discount is a scam because they take 60% out of what you pay for the plan in \"overhead\" charges. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Rush happens in the fall and spring. Invite is highly recommended to join any rush events (ie you cant just show up to the house), but walk-throughs are a different story. The selectiveness is really dependent on the fraternity themselves. Just be yourself and you'll find a house for you. How do walk-throughs and rush events differ? Do walk-throughs happen first, and then from there you get invited to rush events? So this year the way it worked is that there were two days where rushees were led in groups to tour every house. At that point most rushees narrowed it down to their top 5 houses. The following two days were walk in events. For those you went to your favorite houses and basically gave them your information and mingled. If they like you then they'll invite you to private events throughout the week and use those to slowly narrow down the rushees until they decide who to bid.  FIJI is the only house that basically doesn't do any formal rush. They rush a few kids at the beginning of the year but 90% of their pledges get recruited out of high school. Other than FIJI you can get a bid at any house as long as they like you. There are a few houses that are going to care about your GPA and use that as a metric to narrow down the potential bid pool, but for the most part these guys are just looking for guys to bro down with. <eos> \n",

I like it so far... there are quite a few Informatics courses that also count for the specialization (and in my opinion INFO courses are often a bit easier for CS majors). Search Informatics was really good. I haven't taken B403 though, so we'll see. Also no 311 with scheme. which I hate. But if you're a scheme fan go for it. I'm a CS major that graduated this past December, but the requirements changed multiple times while I was going through so I can't really help you out with that. If you have questions about specific classes though, I'll try to assist. It looks like I would have done the 'systems' specialization had I chosen to switch, as I ended up taking all of those anyway. Oh god noooooooo not 401 Well, not with Chauhan anyway. He's a great guy, but HOLY SHIT THAT CLASS IS HARD. Open book/open note, and the average on tests was 50-60%. Everyone I took it with hated the class because they felt like they were totally failing all semester. It's also not terribly practical info compared to, say, a programming class, or 403 which is a fantastically useful class. 401 is more of a \"I want to become a grad student\" class. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Not very difficult, so long as your GPA is competitive and you have a good transfer essay. The points you need to hit home are: 1. GPA 2. Essay Why you are transferring, and what you are bringing to Indiana University as a new student. What challenges you have faced to get to this point in your life and how you overcame them (essay prompt). 3. Are you applying for financial aid? If not, your chances of getting accepted are even higher as they know you will bring in full tuition revenue. If you are, hopefully your GPA is solid and you have a killer essay.  Source: Got accepted for transfer to IU with lower GPA thrice this year. Initially to transfer for Spring 2016, then reapplied for Fall 2016, deferred my transfer to Spring 2017. Put strategy into my essays and succeeded! Let me know if I can be of further resource to you. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Phew, there are a lot of bars, I tried to keep them *mostly* positive when I felt it was possible. Feel free to throw in your own two cents. **BRO BARS** KOK: Wanna get good deals on shit food? Wanna drink top shelf liquor for cheap? Come out on Tuesday or Wednesday. Otherwise its super pricey. Brothers: Three dollar beers on Wednesday, and the best tap of the Bro scene.  Sports: Wanna see someone throw up in sand? Come here. **HIPSTER BARS** The Atlas: PBR is $5 a pitcher. Bartenders will befriend you if you don't act like a dickhead. The Bishop*: 3 dollar pint night on Wednesdays is great. Music here ranges from Ok to Good. Never Bad, Never Awesome. The House Bar: Where anything goes. I've seen dogs running around, and people smoking joints on the porch. The Wild West **BEER ENTHUSIAST BARS** Yogis: Best tap in town, most knowledgeable bartenders, better prices. More zombie dust than anyone in town. The Tap: Pay more for less. A huge selection in bottles. Largest tap, but I wouldn't say its all worth the money, lack of atmosphere. **BARS WITH NO CROWD** Dunnkirk: Surprisingly not bro-ey, despite being part of the Kilroys trio. The Upstairs: AMFs are a good way to black out. Koozie night on Monday is a good way to prepare for summer. Nicks: Play sink the biz and eat biz fries. **TOWNY BARS** The Vid: Once the hipster jewel of town, the crowd now seems to be older, more towny/grad studenty bar. Lots of pool tables and dart boards. Best place for parlor games. Cheap pitchers on Sundays, if you forgot to buy beer. Alley Bar: A great secret. A night here is one you will likely remember, even if you get completely hammered. The Office Lounge: You will see things here.  Steve's Place: ?!Any one want to report in!? **MUSIC VENUES** The Bluebird: Great Karaoke on Mondays. More national acts than any other bar. Local bands here are usually of the cover band/ crowd pleaser variety *The Bishop: The Bishop is also a live music venue. Better local acts here, but the National acts are almost always obscure hipster bands. The Players Pub: A good place to see local folk, jazz groups. More middle aged local players, but excellent stuff. Lower key, and definitely less college. **GASTRO PUBS** The Irish Lion: Mainly an eatery, but a fantastic place to get hammered on St. Patty's Day. Crazy Horse: A good alternative to Yogi's or KOK for sports, and generally better food. Some light music entertainment, but nothing I've seen there has ever made me want to rave about it. Lennie's: First a restaurant, but also home to Bloomington Brewing Company. Toe to toe, a better brewer than the much more visable Upland. A good place to take home a growler, or go out for drinks when the expectation isn't \"Gettin' Drunk\" Upland Brewery: Awesome Sandwiches. Bit Pricey, but always consistent. A place to sample all the largest brewery in town has to offer. IMPORTANT: This is also a great place to get take out bottles when you need beer for a party, but forgot about Sunday liquor sales! More expensive, but the real cost would be not having beer for your party! **GAY BARS** -Note: As a straight male, I can't comment with complete authority, but I've been to both bars a few times, and ALWAYS have a great time. The Backdoor: Right behind the Atlas, and a great place to go dancing when you meet someone at the Atlas. Limited bar, but I think thats a technicality that they are trying to correct... something about different levels of liquor licenses is what I've heard. Uncle E's: A bit of a drive from downtown, but worth it. Thursday karaoke is a huge draw. Lot of people performing some great covers while dancing on the pole in the center of the stage **CLASSY BARS** The Rail: Most expensive cocktails, but they are heavy in their preparation and delicious. A good place to sit and talk. Atmosphere heavy. The bar is a throwback to pre-prohibition style saloons. <eos> \n",

And you'd eventually need to get approval from the Martial Arts Committee (student-run) So that would be another good place to start to get the word out to students who would be interested. I can put you in contact with the current chair of that committee if you were interested. This sounds interesting, however I have absolutely zero background in Kendo. I'm willing to help out though. Also involve in martial arts at IU, this is definitely a great idea of OP is serious about making this happen I'm totally interested! What can I do to help? The first thing we need to do is to get a group of students that are interested, and then start going through the things on [this checklist page]([url link] Because the club sports are student clubs, all of the footwork and such must be done by students.

Also not a bad walk from Forest which is the best food on campus, IMO I eat at forest most of the time and it’s good. I also enjoy a lot of the food at Wright. The basement of Wells has really good food as well, it just is kind of a long wait usually <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Do yourself a favor and stay out of the whole Greek life scene. It's overrated and negatively contributes to campus and the university. In my opinion, a majority - if not all - of the sororities and fraternities should be abolished from campus. After all, it's no fun buying friendship, nor is it fun when all other students of IU and residents of Bloomington have to suffer because of Greek's exploitative and raucous behavior. I'd aim for 14-16. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Thanks for the advice. The thing is, though, that I don't have a radio show, nor am I even studying at the university. Or in the same country. I'm a Norwegian student who stumbled across this radio channel about half a year ago. I've listened to it on and off and found several shows that I eventually started tuning in to on a regular basis. I also enjoyed listening to local music and it was refreshing to listen to news/discussion segments made by fellow students - and not just nationwide news channels. I'd like to tune in this semester too, but a schedule makes everything a bit easier for me to follow. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Going off last year, * Unlimited # per team * Bottle service with a fifth of mid price liquor (Smirnoff, Jack, etc) and a case of beer * Three topics that change week to week (IU basketball, current events, celebrity bullshit, voice actors, all sorts of stuff) * I don't know when it starts Also: * It's loud as shit. Seriously. You can't converse between questions. * The MC is pretty damn creepy, and so are the some of the sexual challenges (you don't have to do these necessarily) * You essentially have to spend $ to win, buying shots for your team or another; and also complete some kind of challenge like eating a bunch, tobasco shot, pushups, or \"sexual ones\" like same sex kissing or similarly creepy stuff initiated by the MC * it's not really about smarts and knowledge but rather strategy, dumb luck, and willingness to spend money and put aside your dignity onstage for challenges I was on a winning team a few times last year. If you have to use your lifelines early, just leave and go drink somewhere more fun, you will probably get a headache and lose if you can't bank them for the end. <eos> \n",

He's very helpful to students, extremely well connected, and brilliant. With your interests he's a natural fit. He's actually my honors thesis advisor! Good! He'll be tremendously helpful throughout your MPA. I worked with and for him during grad school and he opened a lot of doors for me. I recommend emailing the graduate secretary for European Studies.

            "<bos> The official rule is that grades are due by 3 PM the third day after either the last class or the final (whichever is later). Unfortunately, professors tend to not follow that so grades get posted whenever they get around to it. Once they submit the grades, they usually show up sometime at night that day (eg after 8 PM) depending on when they submitted it. Classes will show individually based on when the grades for that class were submitted. Official transcripts for the semester are available around 11 days after the end of the semester. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I love Tulip Tree. It's way cheaper than Union Street and the same price as Campus View. I would decide like now though, they started signing up at the beginning of October so it'll be too late soon. You can schedule or just walk in for a tour at all three. I don't talk to any of my neighbors and you probably wouldn't have that environment in any apartment. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm on the north end of town. Heard a LOT of sirens going along the bypass for something like ten minutes without a break. That's finally died down.  Also heard a series of bangs maybe half an hour ago. Sort of like someone slamming a car door shut every two seconds a total of five times. My suspicious mind suspects that this may, indeed, have been someone slamming their car door shut five times. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Let´s just say you haven´t been to a basketball game until you´ve been to Assembly Hall. How would Assembly Hall have a difficult time stacking up against any other college basketball environment? First off, there are 46 thousand people attending IU and only about 18% go greek. It's safe to say, yes, you can have fun, if not more fun, by not being in a fraternity. I don't like the greek life here at IU. It's terribly elitist and obnoxious, but that's just me. Second, the basketball games are unlike anything you'll see. Assembly Hall is rated #1 court design by ESPN. We don't joke around when we say we're one of the biggest student sections in the US. There is something going on every single night on campus so theres no worry about not having things to do without going greek. It's an incredible university and even better town. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm taking an easy 100 level astronomy class at Ivy Tech for an NM. Its cheaper then on campus and its all online. Piece of cake. Class starts in June I believe. I work for the business school. Every student that I've ever met who took classes online (via the Kelley Direct) gave a positive review. Now, I'll admit, I've not met more than a dozen students, but they seemed to like the format... it's varies depending on which program you are using, I'm sure. <eos> \n",

Free therapy through the health center with only barely experienced student counselors. Again, you get what you pay for. It's really more for their resume than your well-being. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The fuck is up with people downvoting this? Fuckin' dumbasses.. Reddit has a voting algorithm which makes artificial downvotes which aren't actually there. None too sure how it works, but apparently it's to prevent upvoting/downvoting bots. It used to not start the vote spoofing until 10 votes...so typically if you see a downvote before the score is 10, then it's a real downvote. We definitely have a downvote troll on this subreddit...someone basically downvotes everything here... and our community isn't very good about upvoting relevant materials. It's a two fold issue. Nothing good ever happens past 2AM It might have to do with the fact that it's I who posted it. I have a personal downvote troll, apparently. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I lived in Rabb my freshman year. It's nice enough (as any of the dorms are, except maybe the newest ones). I don't think I would have wanted to live anywhere else after seeing other peoples dorms. Location wise, it's super convenient, close to multiple food courts, you have printing and computers in the lounge in Rabb, theres a library where you can rent DVDs, easy to get to most of the places you'll have classes (or as easy as any of the other dorms). Rabb was cool, it's the tall tower in the middle. One of the elevators are almost always needing maintenance, but that wasn't really a big deal. The bathrooms get a bit nasty during the weekend if people on your floor are not good at handling themselves. We kept the beds bunked because then the room didn't feel tiny. I'm pretty sure theres AC in the rooms, so that was super nice in the early fall. When the heat comes on my room was hot even with the heat turned off, so we kept the window open all the time. It kind of sucked because you could hear everything that happens at the circle drive in front or the fire department behind Eigenmann. But that really wasn't bad. Pizza X and Jimmy Johns are super close if you get sick of the food courts, but being close to Wright was convenient, even if the food wasn't great. It's definitely not the party dorm though. Not that it's super strict either, but it was definitely different there on a Thursday or Friday than McNutt... but to be honest, that's more about who you know and who you hang out with (i.e. if you get along with your floor). Usually to really party, people leave the dorms anyways. The RAs do patrol, so you have to keep it together. All the buildings are attached underground if you need to be sneaky. Since Rabb has the main office, on the weekends (and especially Welcome Week and Little 5) theres usually some RA and maybe IUPD posted up in the main lobby. If you're not drawing attention to yourself you don't usually have to worry. My biggest tip would be go in with a good attitude, try to make friends with people on your floor, go to events, have fun but go to class and keep it together. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> It will be extremely dead. Most students will be out of town already and the IU vs Rutgers football game will be one of the smaller crowds of the year. There is a men’s basketball game on Sunday. This is one of 6 games that has tickets available all season. I would recommend checking out the game and Assembly Hall if you’ve never been! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'd say there's really no point in trying to circumvent the rules here. Shelters will check with your building owner to ensure dogs are allowed. Dogs very often have some kind unpredicted issue (like barking frequently, not getting along with other pets, an anxiety or physical health issue, etc.), any of which make it more difficult to conceal the dog's existence. Inevitably there will be a maintenance issue or an apartment showing or some reason for a property manager or maintenance staffer to enter your unit. Taking your dog for regular walks or even just to go have a piss will become a daily exercise in paranoia. Not to mention when you are caught you will have essentially no legal recourse. You broke the rules, now you're their bitch. And perhaps worst of all, then you'll have a dog that needs re-homing. I'm saying this as a dog-lover: don't become part of the problem, please. The solution is to request permission to have a dog and if it is not granted then next year when your lease is up you can consider moving, and if you do, you can cite that as the reason; no harm done, and perhaps they'll change their policy at a future point in time. <eos> \n",

Honestly, the more you get into the major the more you'll realize that it's not the laptop that counts, it's more if you know how to properly use EMACS and the shell...also you'll have a hate/love relationship with puTTy... Any laptop is fine, but I would try to have a big enough drive so you can partition it to run Linux along with any other OS you want. You'll do a lot of programming on the CS department's Linux machines. I think the distro that they use is still Red Hat, but I haven't taken a CS class in 2 years. You don't really need a great computer, but I would look at Newegg or Amazon for deals instead of going straight to the manufacturer's website. <eos> \n",

Or maybe that's just because I was living in Collins... You could shave/trim over a toilet and let the pubic hair fall in as you cut it off. This. Afterwards I just get a piece of toilet paper and wipe any pubes that got stuck on the edges of the toilet off and flush it down. <eos> \n",

I have a senior friend who lives there and she said that it doesn't usually happen and that she loves living there so hopefully it was a one time thing. Somehow I doubt the group of individuals who did that will ever see this post. People do that in front of the dorms sometimes too. I feel your pain.

            "<bos> Hey! I'm a senior undergrad at IUB from Maryland. Here's hoping I can answer some of your questions... 1. I would say some of the best places are either south of campus or anywhere further away. Most of the \"party scene\" happens in the northwest side of campus, but that's not to say that parties don't happen anywhere else.  2. The buses are free to all IU students. The IU buses are operated by the university and available to all who ride them (including non-IU students), whereas the Bloomington buses are free if you show your student ID to the bus driver. If you don't have your ID, you can pay the driver $1 in cash or change. The buses are worth it if you don't have a car. I rode them religiously my freshmen through junior years (before I bought a car), and never had any real complaints. Sure, sometimes the buses are overcrowded when it rains or snows, and sometimes they're delayed because of traffic, but what public transportation system doesn't have its problems? 3. My favorite restaurants in the downtown area include anything on fourth street (okay, not super downtown, but close), Farm, and Irish Lion. Scotty's Brewhouse is a chain but I have always liked their burgers (extensive gluten-free menu!) As for the hiking, there is actually a LOT of outdoor activities to do in the Bloomington area. Sure, we don't have the Appalachian Mountains, but we have Hoosier National Forest (just south in Brown County), Griffy Lake, Lake Monroe, Lake Lemon, the Brown County Firetower...etc. The world is your oyster. IU has an outdoor store too in their Eigenmann Hall with staff that can help you rent gear for your adventure. This is where I rent kayaks from when I paddle around Lake Monroe, which I enjoy doing when the weather is nice!  4. There is much debate about what a Hoosier is. It came into use around 1830, around the same time John Finley wrote a poem called \"The Hoosier's Nest\". There are many popular theories, but all you need to know is that a Hoosier is someone from Indiana. [source]([url link] Hope this helps! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I would contact the Admissions Office or speak to an academic advisor if you have been assigned one. AskIU are not going to be experts in that area - they are more a general question/answer type of service, so they would likely just point you in the same direction. Speak to your advisor, asap. You might get put on probation if you're not careful, so check in with them and see what you need to do. If you weren't assigned an advisor it's because you aren't necessarily in a specific degree-seeking path right now you have the generic advisers that you can go see in the student building I believe. Also I would recommend taking a semester of elective courses to bring your GPA back up. <eos> \n",

It's one of the many reasons why I've spent the last 7 years of my life compiling and creating high quality versions of the episodes. The website is located at [[url link] There you can view almost every episode of the show, albeit in low quality. The highest res versions are 640x480. ohhhh yeah love this show. If I was there this summer I would! I had a math professor my freshman year who talked about having them in class and watching their show. They have a website (google it), the ones where they ride a bike with a pet through Jordan and stuff are just hilarious. Plus it's a cool look into IU of yesteryear. <eos> \n",

On a practical level, not sure I could recommend a flashlight big and heavy enough to operate as a weapon or a full-on combat baton, although at least the latter would be less obtrusive and less of a pain to carry around.

Make the heat is on/window is closed so the pipes don't freeze and burst while no one is there. 3. Document any policy violations in plain view - alcohol bottles, paraphernalia, candles, covered smoke detectors, etc.  It's not a fishing expedition, but if people leave shit out they'll probably get cited when they come back. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello and thank you for your questions! Email at phbhatt@indiana.edu if you have any questions after you’re done reading the essay I’m about to post here . I am a current Kelley Direct MBA student and as of earlier this year I now work for Kelley Direct too. I want to put that out there so you understand my bias, but I can relate to your concerns. I too was debating between a highly ranked in-person evening MBA program in Chicago and Kelley Direct because of similar reasons.  First on the interaction: Before you start the program and again in your second year, you will be on campus for a week with your classmates (it’s called Kelley Connect Week). This week is heavily packed with network events, live lectures with professors, and a case competition where you work on solving a real business problem for a local business (1st year) and an internationally-based business in an emerging market such as Southeast Africa (2nd year). The week is designed to build those intangibles. We often talk about developing “emotional and cultural intelligence” in our MBA program, and Kelley Connect Week is a big part of that. Here is a blog post about Kelley Connect Week from a student who just attended it: [url link]  Outside of those Connect weeks, you have the option to go on international trips through our AGILE program. These are designed to be immersive. You get to be a consultant for a local business and get to do a presentation in front of professors and company owners/executives at the end of the trip. This again helps develop those skills that come from working under pressure and in unfamiliar environments. From what I have heard, people who go on these trips form long-term friendships. I can’t speak to this first-hand, but here is a blog post about AGILE from student who went on trip: [url link]  Finally the 3rd way to get a lot of interaction outside of class (I’ll speak to this next) is joining clubs and attending networking events. I joined the marketing club when there were 2 people, now there are over 30 members. In the last 18 months we have added 4 new clubs and our Student Leadership Association has been taking an active role in helping the clubs get more members and funding for events. Last year the Marketing Club held a national conference in Chicago where we toured companies (Google, Ogilvy and a boutique social media agency) and had speakers come present on various marketing topics the next day. Just yesterday our Entrepreneurship  Venture Capital Club brought students together in Indianapolis for a Shark Tank-like start-up conference. Many of my closest relationships in the program have come from clubs and events like that. If you want to network and get to know people, the opportunity is there, you just have to prioritize it.  Now the classroom: The nice thing about the program is that most of your professors will host a live lecture every week. When you attend the live lecture you have the opportunity to ask questions and chat with both the professor and classmates and get real-time responses. If you miss the lecture, then you can watch the recording any time and the chats that occurred during the live lecture are visible in the recording. This helps you see what your classmates were asking in case you had similar questions.  Many of your classes will also have group work. It is not uncommon for me to be on a conference call or Google Hangout every other week to discuss assignments. Most often these will be cases and sometimes problem sets (in classes like Finance and Accounting). Discussion forums are also common in classes. Sometimes you are discussing current events – like right now in my Business Law  Ethics class, we are encouraged to find a current event and discuss it in the forum. We have been talking about the Donald Sterling v. NBA case and Facebook’s emotional experiment in our last two lectures which then carried over to our discussion forum.  Because of the variety and high quality of interaction and the opportunities available to us, I don’t feel like I’ve missed out on anything by choosing the online program. Academics-wise is the same. The professors that teach us are the same ones that teach the full-time and evening MBA programs. You have to work hard to earn your grade – which is what you should expect out of a top-ranked program anywhere. I think you get more out of it when you’re challenged.  I can’t speak to the MSF, but I would be more than happy to connect you to a current student, alumni or staff member that can help you with your questions. You can either email me or reply here with your preference and I’ll make sure someone gets in touch with you by early next week. You might want to speak to several students to get a more complete picture.  Sorry for the essay, but hope it helps! **TL;DR: Email phbhatt@indiana.edu to take this offline and we can setup a call w/ myself and other students and alumni.** <eos> \n",

Everyone I know that played is long gone. But I'm sure you can find someone. Might be a club, but I'm not totally sure. Clubs may also have those unfavorable kinds of players, lol. If you happen to find one, let me know. I've never done tabletop, but I'm very interested in getting involved. Just never been able to find a group. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> It normally just takes like 15 minutes or so Most of these have to be manually approved by an actual person, so it just depends on how frequently the approver (usually the instructor, sometimes a designated person in the department) checks their eAdd queue. If it's been a couple of days still pending, email the instructor to check in. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Damn bro, Sorry to hear your frustrations. I met a lot of my friends playing intramural basketball and football. Also I always went to Lan War at IU which is a decent sized event with people that I got along with and met some good friends. Everyone has their own things they are into, I guess just try to find like minded people you enjoy to be around. Being introverted would make it harder but with sports and stuff it forces you to do stuff with other people.  Just an idea, good luck bro Honestly, your best bet is to join clubs or organizations that interest you. There are more than 700 at IU and with some quick searching online, you can find a list of them. Sororities and fraternities aren't the only organizations you can join to make friends; I've definitely made all of my current friends from involvement in student organizations. They are a way to bring similar students together. Having a job could be an opportunity to meet some friends too; what are your interests/hobbies? You can also make friends in group projects, which are numerous in Kelley, if you get lucky. I have made a few friends from them (as well as been in a few groups where I'd prefer not to interact with members ever again honestly). Lastly, sit next to someone in one of your classes and start talking to them...this made me a group of friends (that I only stuck with for a couple months, but beside the point) that I spent a lot of time with. Oh, also; if you meet someone from one of the more populated parts of Indiana, it is nearly certain that they have a lot of friends from high school at IU, so if you befriend someone like that and get pretty close you'll probably end up being introduced into a friend group in some way or another. Get yourself out there; there are very few people who would say \"I specifically DON'T want a new friend\"! I feel for you. Loneliness sucks.  A couple questions: Why do you think transferring elsewhere would make you happy/have friends? Although Indiana is large, do you think a smaller school would equal more friendships? What's your major/academic interest(s)? What clubs/orgs have you joined?  College is supposed to be awesome and having friends/social life is a part of being successful. I, too, am from the south and was DA to Kelley (and the College, which I chose) and apart of honors. However I left my previous institution not because I didn't have friends, but I didn't feel like I belonged, and I found that IU was where I belonged. I transferred to Indiana at 21, so I had the legal drinking age/bar experience advantage, but it still took me awhile to adjust and be more extroverted. Through classes, roommates, clubs/orgs, work and just being on campus/the bus I made a ton of friends. I wish I could tell you what worked for me and tell you it would work for you, but everyone is different. IU is a great school and it sounds like you have a lot going for you. Don't give up! Your person/people are out there <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Past rider here. You have to qualify with a team. you can either join an existing team (cutters) or you can create a new team (reddit). You only officially need 3 people on your team, but realistically you should have 5-6 if you want to place well (only 4 can race but its nice to have choices on race day!) For girls you are pretty much guaranteed a slot in the race as a team. But the guys race has more teams that try to qualify and its pretty competitive. If you wanna race this year get a team and start training now. I was always really frustrated that teams didn't choose their names in a more rock n' roll way. If you make a team I think you should call yourselves Dragon Fire Killas or something. Edit:spelling <eos> \n",

I know that there is a chase ATM in the strip mall on 10th Street. Fairly sure that it takes deposits but not positive so you could check it out. It is on the far right of the parking lot between Fortune Cookie and Subway. Hope that helps! <eos> \n",

Feel free to PM me and we can figure it out! :) You should definitely come to the meet up regardless, especially if you've just transferred here. They're always a jolly good time!

            "<bos> There is no point in getting an E pass if you live off campus during any semester. Just park at college mall for free, and take the 9 bus onto campus.  Sorry, I just hate supporting IU parking. I wasted my money on an E pass this year that I never used. During the year, most commuter students I know have had to get an E pass, which lets you only park at the stadium. Then an A bus is fairly regular getting to campus (Wells, etc). It's not the best, but it's the only parking permit the campus will give you unless you're a professor, live in a residence hall, or are disabled. It's frustrating but that's pretty much it unless you're wealthy and can pay to park at the Union or any of the parking garages, or have a friend who lives close to campus who will let you park at their house (did that before for a friend).  Frankly, Bloomington's parking situation is less than ideal, but they're trying to make it so campus is more walking/biking/bus friendly than anything. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I went to the place right downtown across the street from peoples park, next to the ice cream place. I can't remember the guys name but i know he was also a comedian, ask for him. Great haircut and great guy, still miss having a regular barber like that. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The sample room they show on tours is really standard and it's in teeter. If you want really honest opinions on everything just be super relaxed and friendly to your tour guide. They really do want to help as much as possible. Source: I was a tour guide (graduated in May) feel free to pm me any questions! Honestly, the official showings are really really true-to-life. I did it two different years informally just by asking the person at the desk. What you see is EXACTLY what you get.  If you want to **REALLY** see what they look like, catch one of the doors as someone leaves Wright (library side) and just walk down a hallway. That's the gritty underbelly of student housing. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Did you end up going anywhere? I'm a Lightning fan and would love to watch some games with some people I'm from St. Louis and am a blues fan, but I'm not in Bloomington right now, still home for Thanksgiving Break <eos> \n",
            "<bos> You're comparing Informatics to Computer Science on CS's terms, which is absolutely ridiculous. I could sit here and say that I am a history major and that CS sucks because you totally don't learn any history, that's exactly what you're doing by comparing CS and Informatics the way you are. Informatics is largely a *social science*. Informatics is applied information science, and information science is not computer science. Information science has a large social component that is studied under the methodology of social sciences aside from computational and representational components studied in the more traditional computer science fashion. Computers are machines used by human beings, and while computer science as a discipline is keen to neglect that fact and focus solely on the machines, informatics is not. Informatics as a discipline examines not only the machine but the social context in which it is used. Vocationally, Informatics grads do jobs traditionally dominated by graduates of programs in IT or IS (information technology or information systems). To say that Informatics grads \"make websites\" is to break it down to the same level of saying that computer science grads \"write code\"; technically true, but far from the whole story. It is the stereotypical computer science view to go so far as to assume that the only meaningful work employed in the creation of a website is coding, and therefore because computer science students learn coding, they are equally as good at creating websites as Informatics grads (an infuriating piece of non-logic from ignorance). Again vocationally, your categorical groups of informatics grads are way off. Informatics graduates typically get jobs as consultants; people who are required to have people skills, organization skills, specific knowledge in a few areas and wide knowledge in a lot of areas both technically and non-technically, and most of all a knack for solving real world, wicked problems. All of these things are exactly what Informatics teaches. Your overview of the major's structure focuses on only those places where it is comparable to computer science, only those places where it is related to the mathematical, representational, or technical aspects of technology. It is remarkable convenient how you ignore the large social science component even in breaking down the organization of the classes. This, finally, deserves a stupid of the day award or something: Number-crunchers and IT support for real researchers. You don't do the biology research yourself, but you may do the computer simulations or statistical analysis of the results It's like saying... Software engineers provide systems support for *real* pilots. They don't fly the planes themselves but they write the programs that help fly better. Replace with *any field of your choice.* <eos> \n",

            "<bos> IU Campus Bus Service. $13/HR. Flexible schedules. Driving a bus isn't hard; they train you and pay for everything. Requirements: must be 21+, pass drug screen, and be US citizen or permanent resident. Call Brian at 812-855-1580 for more information. Recreational Sports is a pretty good place to get a job. Depending on the position you could range from doing nothing, to cleaning machines. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Just find an apartment for sublease on IU classifieds or craigslist. It'll most likely be cheaper. Sublease opportunities will be everywhere shortly. Also, it will be a better experience for the summer. I've thought about it, but I'm planning on staying for about 6 weeks at the most. Any idea on where I can find a sublease of that length? Most I've seen want to sublease for May-August. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> FYI it's Franklin College. There's not really a easy way using public transportation. You could do Blomington shuttle to Indy airport, take IndyGo shuttle to downtown from airpport, transfer to IndyGo bus that goes to Greenwood Park Mall, take Johnson County Access from the mall to Franklin. It wouldn't be worth it for just a weekend. Your best bet is to look into the ride share stuff on OneStart and just grab a ride from someone who is going to Indy or post that's what you're looking for. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> There were apparently some group accounts that got hijacked by spammers. I'm getting nonsensical jibberish with pictures of pills. I'm assuming overseas pharmacies with cheap \"Viagra.\" They are coming from a non IU address with me BCC'd on it. I'm assuming I signed up for something I shouldn't have with that email. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Good fucking luck C204 with Pam Sklar if you can. The class is mostly attendance and easy deliverables, and the Target project at the end of the semester isn't as bad as everyone says.  Source: just had that class with her last semester :) I have morrone. How's business law? It can't be that bad <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Got it. Generally, freshmen are required to live with other freshmen, so unfortunately I don't think that will be allowed. Most colleges have co-ed residential halls, but the rooms are generally all girl or all boy. Do you have any other questions? Okay, I see what you mean now. Based on my campus, the general rules in the freshmen dorms would override any form of mutual requests, but it doesn't hurt to call and ask <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Why wouldn't a 12 point scale convert nicely to a 4 point scale? Can't you just divide your GPA by 3?  For what it's worth, I've also heard IU has become harder to get in to recently. I have a cousin who is a sophomore in high school, and a few of her friends didn't get in, despite good GPAs and plenty of extracurriculars. Not helpful, but good luck. For some reason you can't divide by three, I don't know why. Like the other dude said, I'm apparently a 2.9 whereas if I divided by 3 I'd be a 2.5 That's also disconcerting :(. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Undistributed credits count toward requirements such as \"earn a total of X credits in y subject.\" For the Political Science minor, you need a total of 18 credits in political science. Any undistributed credits you receive count toward the 18 total. However, they don't count for specific class requirements (like Y205).  Also, on your Test Credit page in OneStart, you should see a x00 number next to your AP credit. This tells you what level your undistributed credit counts for (usually 100 or 200).  This is what I've learned in my experience, but I'd still check with an advisor to be sure. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I can't use your help, but I must say this is very nice of you and I thank you:) No problem, I drive a lot for Lyft and have a lot of dead miles that I drive without passengers. Also I had some friends who needed some help moving so I thought I would open it up to other students. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> IU classifieds typically has people offering and requesting rides to and from Indy, may be cheaper than the shuttle. Figured, but the only ones I see either don't run on weekends or only drop off at the airport <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Well IU actually has a pretty good Criminal Justice program, but it's not really better than Michigan State's, both are strong. So it really comes down to which you like more (and I guarantee you'll have a good time at either university). Just to give you a general idea IU is going to run you minimum of 120 grand for a bachelors. Michigan State you're probably looking at closer to 50 assuming you get scholarships to neither. That's a difference of 70 THOUSAND dollars. Even if you like IU more do you like it 70,000 dollars more?  If I were you it'd be MSU hands down. EDIT: Looked up some better numbers. IU estimates closer to 41 with room and board. MSU is closer to 22 for you. So 164 vs 88, that's 76K difference. And if you have to take out loans for IU that means interest on top. Plus a BS in your degree only makes around 35k the first year and generally tops out around 70. Unless you go to law school but that job markets in the absolute shitter, plus law school debt. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If I could hide one of those kittens in my dorm, I totally would. They are all so adorable and I hope they find good homes. The orange one reminds me of my 23-year-old cat who died last year when the neighbor's son kicked him like a football. Aw sorry about your cat! That must've been terrible. No not they haven't gotten any shots yet, but that sounds good. Is there a certain kitten you're interested in? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I lived there my senior year and loved it. It was way cheaper than the dorms and is not a bad space for two people. It's also great to still be on campus and so close to the SRC. Did you get a unit with a balcony? I did not! We chose no balcony so there is more floor-space in the actual apartment and I also believe we're on the ground floor so we won't have to deal with elevators/stairs. Glad you liked it thats good to hear. My brother did mention that the vast majority of residents he encountered there were Asian. I have no problem with that whatsoever, obviously, but it just makes me wonder why that would be the case. I had a hunch that maybe they prefer on-campus apartments because it doesn't require the students who don't speak English natively to have to fill out multiple contracts, deal with landlords, ect since RPS apartments are just simply billed to the bursar with everything like internet, electric, cable included. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I added some more specifics to my post. Whilst having money is very important, tell us a little more about your profile... what kind of situation you are hoping for, perhaps location, and any other preferences...  Whatever, people tend to have more luck if they give a bit more basic info about themselves around here when looking for a place. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Thanks to Dave for keeping Bloomington classy. They sure are! He and a friend insisted on walking me home, despite it being the opposite direction from their home. It was so sweet, they're such gentlemen. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Take a look at the official calendar at [url link] for breaks and what not. Midterms are at the end of the first eight-weeks which is several weeks before Thanksgiving break. I don't think the \"midterm week\" is very defined. It can depend on the class- I've had midterms for classes stretched over three weeks because the professors or departments will schedule tests or presentations whenever they can fit them in. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Yeah, you’re all good to rush. Just make sure your GPA is above the 2.5 requirement if you do have a GPA once you transfer in! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Having a small community in which to discuss ideas and exchange support would be excellent for me. Most people cant do a big thing alone. Something about the human brain needs other faces in their world to make their big goals get mental and real traction. Im in. I have some ideas. just pm me or let me know when/where you want to meet. It is very interesting how they pool resources in that way. Even in my friend's case the people were not family, just friends. They threw a bunch of cash in the pot and anyone in the group could use it. I'm not sure but I think they were required to replace what they had borrowed from the group. In other words if one of them needed 100k for a start-up, they just took the money from the group and then when their business took off they paid it back. Somewhat like a business loan but without the interest and stress. This is very common in Asian culture. Look for information on Chinese people in San Francisco and credit cards: they don't usually have them. They share all of their resources within a family system and shop specifically at family stores. Very successful system. I think how I will set it up is that we will have the first section of each meeting devoted to a certain topic that will go up for discussion. Topics like budgeting, advertising, personal development, etc and we will either watch a short video by an expert or have a guest speaker on the topic. After that we will discuss the topic and then move on to let people throw out their own ideas for critiquing in the second half.  I've already drafted some basic rules. I will state them in the first meeting. I think it will do us all good. See above reply about meets. You just have to keep your eyes open for meets. I'm not going to be able to contact everyone individually. I'm up for it. Pm me when the time comes ! Dude I'm in. I'm thinking about sticking around in btown for a little longer to get a business venture I'm quite passionate about off the ground. This is Zach from RecSports btw, let me know when you are thinking about meeting up to get this going. Ha, you're pretty quick on the ol reddit trigger aren't you. Yeah man, shoot me a text. Not sure if I told you, but I am trying to start a wellness coaching business in the next few years here. Not sure what you're trying to do, but it may end up being mutually beneficial. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I mean I got an id number and then I set up a username, but my email still isn't set up. They just take a while is what my department said I am also a new grad student and I emailed them saying I'm coming. No deposit required. But I did get my id number a few weeks after, but my deadline was April 15 This doesn't exactly answer your question, but I was accepted for the fall of 2013 and I was not required to pay an intent to enroll deposit. I even had a student ID by that point because I came from another IU campus. I did not see anything on my bursar bill until August. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> within \"walking distance\" of the stadium there isn't anything really. There's a mcdonalds and dennys (I think? Something like that) a mile or so west.  Most of the local stuff is southwest of campus. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I don't recommend doing such things. If VoLK3R_9 is a valid student, then he could have his own. And the last thing you want is UITS coming down on your for giving away this to non students. UITS invests heavily in providing such nice services for students, exploiting such a system is a disservice to the university. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If any of your aid received is federal, or awarded through the filing of the fafsa, you should've gotten an award letter telling you the amount you were going to receive. If you dig around OneStart, either in Student Center or your bursar bill, you should be able to find something telling you how much anticipated aid you'll receive. Unless your aid works differently than mine. What Palamandporom said is correct. Also, yes, the situation sucks sucks sucks. But it is what it is. Generally if the financial aid is not disbursed until after you get hit with a late fee, it will be refunded. If this is not the case, call the bursar and explain to them (calmly, it isn't the person on the phone's fault) why \"you\" paid late, and hopefully it will get taken care of. Otherwise, unless things have changed, the late fee, regardless of how much you owe, is about $30/month. Not zero, but compared to what they could charge, that's not too bad. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> That's really inaccurate and not reflective of how the admissions process works *at all.* Well depending on how determined you are to get into Indiana, you can always go to magnet school route, it's what I did. IU has a lot of smaller campuses around Indiana that are direct admit, like Kokomo and Columbus. Once you're there, you only have to complete 12 credit hours and keep your GPA above 2.0 in order to transfer into any campus, including IU-Bloomington. But in all honestly, I think your GPA and test scores will get you in pretty easily. i keep hearing tips about how good an idea it is to get a minor in business at iu, something about what all is required for the minor that students really do well with <eos> \n",
            "<bos> For the intro class your first semester, you'll have a choice between C200 and C211. I'm gonna personally recommend that you take C211- it's the harder one, but I've found that it prepared me better in terms of CS thinking. If you can, try and take the honor's version. The projects are substantially better, and your class will be a lot smaller. Regardless, I'd recommend looking at the Racket documentation before starting, since the language throws a lot of students off early.  Pretty sure that's the only intro CS class you can take, since it's a pre-req for all the other core courses (though there are probably some electives you could take as well). If you're up for it, take Info-I101- it's pretty easy, and you can get CS credit for it as long as you take it before C212. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Because 40,000 people are living on their own for the first time in their lives, they're being exposed to new ideas, parent/loan money, and new situations. Plus most of them are hell bent on partying, hooking up, and taking every advantage of their new freedom. Honestly, a couple incidents every year are to be expected. I live in a safe town of 38,000 people and a couple murders and a couple violent crimes every year are typical. And that's a standard cross section of people, not an 18-24 demographic, which has a higher incident rate. EDIT: Additionally, the demographics at IU skew much harder towards CNN's preferred victim type. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> They’re literally everywhere, they’re way quicker than they look, people don’t follow traffic rules on them, and they’re way more common at the moment. Was on the canal in Indianapolis and people were zooming past all over Could be a rumor but one of my friend’s said that the kid died after getting hit on one of those scooters. I went to IU. I’m also a firefighter paramedic now. When I first saw those scooters speeding around, I thought to myself that it’s only a matter of time before someone gets a nasty head injury from either falling off one of them or getting hit by one of them <eos> \n"
