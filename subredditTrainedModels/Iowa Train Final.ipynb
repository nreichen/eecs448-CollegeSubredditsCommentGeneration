Seriously, just because you are dressed up like a coked up skank doesn't mean you deserve anything. 20 minutes to get drinks delivered, waiting 30 minutes at the bar, and you are going to overcharge me for alcohol. Hire some extra servers, or open some extra bars if it is super crowded on the weekend so I can get a damn beer after midnight. Granted some bars like Joes and Gabes give me great service, and they get my money. However, Summit, Union, and Brothers will never get anything. I am not cheap, I am just sick of being treated like shit. <eos> \", \"<bos> If you have never shot a firearm, and would like the opportunity to do so in a safe environment with knowledgeable people, please send me a PM. This Saturday myself and some others affiliated with the University Shooting Sports Team will be headed to the Hawkeye Range (2200 Amana Rd NW, Swisher, IA 52338). This is not a University event. If you are interested in coming and learning more, please PM me. You will be able to shoot a variety of WWII rifles and more modern ones. There will be no cost, but if you want to provide some money for ammo, I won't object. EDIT: Thanks for the messages guys! Looks like we're gonna have a good little group of people. If you messaged me and we're talking, I'll let you know. Will post more events in the future! Thanks. <eos> \", '<bos> I am an international student from the UK who is considering applying to Iowa for fall 2019 admission. I am an IB student and aim to go to med school. I was wondering if there are any other international students in this sub like me and if they could help to give me an idea as to what the college is like?  <eos> ', '<bos> Hello I have a few questions. I will be an incoming freshman this year and will be living in hillcrest and I want to know how it is? And the next question is Greek life. I am 50/50 about joining a fraternity. If I don’t join one will I have trouble getting into parties and meeting new people? I have older friends that are at Iowa saying you need to join a fraternity to get into the party’s. If so what frats would you recommend. Thank you <eos> ', '<bos> I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge of this program ( good or bad ) and if they would recommend it! Thank you for any info you can offer :)  <eos> ', '<bos> Alright Hawkeyes, I am visiting the area over the summer and me and some friends are planning an Iowa City \"bar crawl.\" Any advice on what bars to hit up? Any local/townee andvice would be appreciated. <eos> ', \"<bos> You guys just want to have a large reddit gathering and drink? I realize it isn't too revolutionary but I would be down to make something like this happen.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Hello! I am a high schooler who will be attending a three day event in late May at UIowa and I remember that last year there was internet at the dorm but it seemed to be that one had to have a university account to enter. I was wondering if things are that way or if I would now be able to access the wifi, and if not if anyone could tell me a username password combination. If anyone could I would really appreciate it and I would not download heavily or share anyone's information. Thank you very much. <eos> \", \"<bos> Hi! I am a transfer student who's first term will be this upcoming Fall semester. I applied for the dorms about a week ago. How long does it usually take for them to let me know if I got accepted/placed on a wait list/got denied for housing? Another question while I am here is how do I go about picking out my dining plan? <eos> \"]\n","['<bos> Referral train? Code: DEANIS <eos> ', \"<bos> Don't go to shitty bars, tip when deserved. It's worked for me. On a slightly related note ....Reddit barcrawl next year? Yes. I do . Pretty much this. Summit, Union and Brothers are bars that I would never step in anyway. Joe's place FTW Tip well on the first few drinks and your service will be great. In really busy places like Brothers this won't work as well. But then again, places like Brothers and Union aren't my scene. Yes, I do. Having spent 7 years frequenting those types of bars, I can say I never really got treated like shit. You have to understand that the fact that it's busy and hard to get a drink isn't the waitress' fault. More often than not they are understaffed. My girlfriend worked at DC's and Pints for a few years and always felt overwhelmed because the manager's never properly staffed the place.  If you don't like fighting a big crowd to get a drink, don't go to the bars with big crowds.  I usually feel sorry for the people that work at places like Summit because they get treated like shit too. A lot of my friends were waitresses there and had nightly stories about drunk dudes groping them, people throwing drinks on the ground or just generally being disgusting. The only upside they have in that situation is the tips, so that's why I tip them. <eos> \", '<bos> Is this going to be a mostly male group? Im a woman and I don’t want to crash the party! No way! I\\'m not sure who will be attending with me, but the club as a whole is actually about to tip mostly female. We aren\\'t \"macho\" or anything. Just a group of people who like to shoot! What time do you think you guys will be out there? I might bring some of my own out. Facebook The University of Iowa Shooting Sports Club Sweet, I just requested to join the fb group! I won\\'t be back on campus until the fall but is this something I can join? I\\'m at that range most weekends anyway. Would love to make some new shooting friends! Pm sent. Do you guys shoot trap ever, or is it mostly rifles? It\\'s actually the reverse. We\\'re mostly trap, skeet and sporting clays. <eos> ', \"<bos> Not an international student here, but I work with a lot of them. The majority of international students here are from Asian countries, so you might have different experiences adjusting etc, being from the UK :) Do you plan to go to med school here? This is hearsay, but several of my international friends have seemed to have trouble being admitted if they weren't citizens etc, the point being that the university wanted doctors who would stay in and serve Iowa, not go elsewhere. Obviously, you need to look into this more. Let me know if you have any particular questions about what the college is like :) It's definitely a party school, but if you're more academically minded, you will definitely find others like you. It's also a very large campus, but quite beautiful, at least in the summer. <eos> \", '<bos> Hillcrest is awesome. As for joining a frat, yeah they have cool parties but you can definitely still have fun at Iowa without being in one, There’s tons of house parties, and the bar scene at Iowa is huge. We have (debatably) the best bars in the big ten and you can get into pretty much any of them with a fake ID. If you’re really interested in joining Greek life just rush at the beginning of the semester  see if you like any of them, you can always drop. <eos> ', '<bos> Hi. Am in the program. It’s a good program that’s been evolving over the past several years since the current head of the program came in, so if you have more specific questions, I can definitely speak to those. In a broader sense, it’s a touch more academic than say the Writer’s Workshop MFAs, but still heavily workshop and practice-based. Your coursework will be radically different depending on your language(s) of choice, and the translators in the program are by and large great people. You’ll develop friendships and close bonds with your cohort. You may also be interested in the publishing side of things, and if so I would encourage working on Exchanges. <eos> ', \"<bos> It honestly depends on what you're looking for. If you want the typical rowdy IC night, then you should hit up the following: DC's, Fieldhouse, Brother's, Sports Column, Airliner, Pints, and when you get drunk enough, Summit and/or Union. If you want a bar that's a little more laid back, my top recommendation would be Joe's Place, although BoJames, Micky's, TCB (a pool hall), and Deadwood all fit that bill too. <eos> \", '<bos> I cannot imagine how awkward this is going to be.

After you connect, you have to agree to terms in a browser and click-through that. There is a time limit on that authentication, then you have to go through the process again. Since it\\'s a vendor it\\'s their responsibility, not the University\\'s, to keep it secure for users. That\\'s correct attwifi SSID is the free guest network now. It\\'s very irresponsible and stupid to use it if you have access to the authenticated and protected network, for sure. ATT doesn\\'t do it any other way, and neither do most other vendors that offer a \"hotspot\" service. I\\'d recommend using a full-tunnel VPN or otherwise making appropriate arrangements if you\\'re concerned about people eavesdropping and/or hijacking.

I'm going there next year, and I have no idea what the dorms are like. It would be much appreciated [:    Yes, I am coming to Iowa and they are quite well structured. There are a lot of very good things about this university but they have a really good chemistry section and it's a really good atmosphere at all times.\n","Reference COMMENTS:<bos> Hopefully you've already seen this: [url link] East side (main campus side): Burge has recently been expanded and so there are some brand new suites (shared bathroom between two two-person rooms) that are very nice. The east-side cafeteria is also there, which is convenient so that you don't have to go outside. There is also a C-store (like a convenience store that you can use hawk dollars at). The floors with suites are coed, otherwise it is separated by floor. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall.  Daum is the honors dorm, next to Burge. It's pretty quiet. There didn't used to be a front desk there, which is inconvenient, but I think they were trying to change that. It is connected to the Belin-Blank building which has an ITC (computer lab). The bathrooms and showers of Daum are private like someone else said, which is an incredible bonus. Also, the residents use an actual key instead of a prox card for entry.  Currier and Stanley are connected and sit on the side of Burge opposite of Daum. The buildings are both older (e.g. my dad lived in C and afaik neither has been remodeled.) There is a ITC (computer lab) in Currier and a fitness center. The cambus route stops in front of Currier.  West-side (across the river from the pentacrest and most of campus): Hillcrest contains the west-side cafeteria and 24-hour fitness room. There is also an ITC (computer lab). Most of the underclassmen athletes live there. The building can be very confusing at first and there is not much uniformity between room size or layout. The floors may be coed, in that one wing may be guys and another wing on the same floor girls. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall. Quadrangle is the first dorm built at Iowa and is pretty ancient. This is where I lived for a year. There is talks to tear it down. One wing of Quad has been remodeled recently and is very nice. All rooms in the building are very large, largest I've seen on campus, as the triples are now doubles etc. However, since the architecture of the rooms is funky, they are not able to have air conditioning units in all the rooms. I lived in one of the towers of Quad, in a corner room without a/c, and it was humongous compared to Slater or Rienow. Quad is also only two stories tall (except for the towers) but the only elevator is on the other side of the building, which I never visited. The guys lived in one half of the building (both floors) and the girls on the other. Slater and Reinow are the identical towers on the west side. Reinow is next to Quad and Slater is across the street. The Cambus stops in front of Reinow when coming from downtown (campus), and stops in front of Slater when going to campus. The rooms are fairly small in the towers, but since the floors are more defined, people tend to get to know their neighbors better, which in my opinion is more fun and easier for adjustment. The floors tend to alternate between all guys or all girls. One difference of Reinow is that it has carpeted floors where Slater does not. South Dubuque Street: Mayflower used to be a huge apartment complex that the university bought because of demand. All the rooms are suites with two people per room and two rooms sharing a kitchen and bathroom. There is a fitness center, ITC, and c-store. You also aren't required to have a full meal plan if you live in Mayflower. Many students detest the distance of Mayflower from campus, but the buses do run between regularly. Personally, I feel that living in Mayflower keeps student from getting the most out of the Iowa experience, because you are not constantly part of the majority of campus life and events.  There is a tunnel between Reinow and Quad and between Daum and Burge. There are many living learning communities, with a multitude of topics, which is something to look into to if you'd like support from peers for a major (premed, music, dental etc.) or a passion (environmentalism, LGBT, leadership etc.). [url link] I liked living on the west side because it allowed me to 'go home' from campus and even though it was just across the river, it felt like a community and I didn't find it too inconvenient except for maybe in the winter. The cambuses inevitably get off schedule, but with the ebongo system, you can literally see where the buses are at on their route and expected arrival time. Obviously, the east side has proximity in its favor. All the dorms have wireless internet and sinks in the rooms. The provided lofts are all universal. Also, you will find people who like to party no matter where you are. I can't believe I just wrote this all out but if you have any more questions let me know. I'm a junior here right now and I work at the ITS Help Desk (just on reddit at work nbd). <eos> \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from rouge import Rouge\n","\n","# create a Rouge object\n","rouge = Rouge()\n","\n","# initialize scores for each variant of ROUGE\n","scores_rouge1 = {'recall': 0, 'precision': 0, 'fmeasure': 0}\n","scores_rouge2 = {'recall': 0, 'precision': 0, 'fmeasure': 0}\n","scores_rougeL = {'recall': 0, 'precision': 0, 'fmeasure': 0}\n","\n","for idx in range(val_len):\n","    generated_text = val_dataset[idx]['generated_text']\n","    reference_summary = val_dataset[idx]['reference_summary']\n","    \n","    scores = rouge.get_scores(generated_text, reference_summary, avg=True)\n","    \n","    #

Mustache Cab (let's go for a mustache ride!).   Seriously, that was their tag line on the side. Any way, as of yet, this is an unlicensed, unregistered company with the city. If you ride them right now, be aware that they are an illegal operation.   Take that as you will. I know plenty of people are fed up enough with the current system that they'll try any alternative. This guy, by nature of being unlicensed, can charge you whatever excessive prices he wishes, and the city has no control over them (other than some high tickets when people like you call in to complain).   If you want to be especially assholeish about it, take a ride, and refuse to pay. Let them call the cops, and when the officer shows up, ask them where the city taxi sticker is (should be top corner of the front window, passenger side).   I like my industry. I understand most of the complaints against it. I'm not anti Uber/Lyft/etc on principal, just against their legal word play. This cab I'm talking about is *not* a ride-share. Bubble light on top, sides decorated with company info and number, etc..   This is just an illegal taxi. And because he's illegal, you have no idea what he feels like he can get away with against you.    This taxi is so far the best they've had. Don't give him any money, or people. They're not your best friends.

I know 0 people at Iowa basically, but am transferring regardless. I have qualified for the honors program and saw that they have housing, like the Centerstone apartments. I'm wondering if these are cool places to live, or if its an all out nerd-fest. While I would much rather just live in an apartment off campus, I have nobody to live with obviously and so i thought this would be a viable option.  Is Centerstone a nice place that's relatively fun...or should I take my chances living with some random people off campus?  Moreover, is there some sort of transfer house that you know of?

The east-side cafeteria is also there, which is convenient so that you don't have to go outside. There is also a C-store (like a convenience store that you can use hawk dollars at). The floors with suites are coed, otherwise it is separated by floor. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall.  Daum is the honors dorm, next to Burge. It's pretty quiet. There didn't used to be a front desk there, which is inconvenient, but I think they were trying to change that. It is connected to the Belin-Blank building which has an ITC (computer lab). The bathrooms and showers of Daum are private like someone else said, which is an incredible bonus. Also, the residents use an actual key instead of a prox card for entry.  Currier and Stanley are connected and sit on the side of Burge opposite of Daum. The buildings are both older (e.g. my dad lived in C and afaik neither has been remodeled.) There is a ITC (computer lab) in Currier and a fitness center. The cambus route stops in front of Currier.  West-side (across the river from the pentacrest and most of campus): Hillcrest contains the west-side cafeteria and 24-hour fitness room. There is also an ITC (computer lab). Most of the underclassmen athletes live there. The building can be very confusing at first and there is not much uniformity between room size or layout. The floors may be coed, in that one wing may be guys and another wing on the same floor girls. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall. Quadrangle is the first dorm built at Iowa and is pretty ancient. This is where I lived for a year. There is talks to tear it down. One wing of Quad has been remodeled recently and is very nice. All rooms in the building are very large, largest I've seen on campus, as the triples are now doubles etc. However, since the architecture of the rooms is funky, they are not able to have air conditioning units in all the rooms. I lived in one of the towers of Quad, in a corner room without a/c, and it was humongous compared to Slater or Rienow. Quad is also only two stories tall (except for the towers) but the only elevator is on the other side of the building, which I never visited. The guys lived in one half of the building (both floors) and the girls on the other. Slater and Reinow are the identical towers on the west side. Reinow is next to Quad and Slater is across the street. The Cambus stops in front of Reinow when coming from downtown (campus), and stops in front of Slater when going to campus. The rooms are fairly small in the towers, but since the floors are more defined, people tend to get to know their neighbors better, which in my opinion is more fun and easier for adjustment. The floors tend to alternate between all guys or all girls. One difference of Reinow is that it has carpeted floors where Slater does not. South Dubuque Street: Mayflower used to be a huge apartment complex that the university bought because of demand. All the rooms are suites with two people per room and two rooms sharing a kitchen and bathroom. There is a fitness center, ITC, and c-store. You also aren't required to have a full meal plan if you live in Mayflower. Many students detest the distance of Mayflower from campus, but the buses do run between regularly. Personally, I feel that living in Mayflower keeps student from getting the most out of the Iowa experience, because you are not constantly part of the majority of campus life and events.  There is a tunnel between Reinow and Quad and between Daum and Burge. There are many living learning communities, with a multitude of topics, which is something to look into to if you'd like support from peers for a major (premed, music, dental etc.) or a passion (environmentalism, LGBT, leadership etc.). [url link] I liked living on the west side because it allowed me to 'go home' from campus and even though it was just across the river, it felt like a community and I didn't find it too inconvenient except for maybe in the winter. The cambuses inevitably get off schedule, but with the ebongo system, you can literally see where the buses are at on their route and expected arrival time. Obviously, the east side has proximity in its favor. All the dorms have wireless internet and sinks in the rooms. The provided lofts are all universal. Also, you will find people who like to party no matter where you are. I can't believe I just wrote this all out but if you have any more questions let me know. I'm a junior here right now and I work at the ITS Help Desk (just on reddit at work nbd). <eos> \n","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9968}\n","neutral\n","Generated comments: Could someone please give me a description of the different dorms at Iowa?

The social scene for underclassmen is mainly house parties. For upperclassmen it is more about the bars. Of course, all students go to bars and all students will go to some house parties while there. Tailgate parties are another huge event. I have been to some tailgates with well over 300 people. I was never in Greek life, but for those that were, it definitely was a huge part of their life. Iowa City is a smaller town (about 100k people including students), but it is quaint and there is a lot to do. I would certainly go to Iowa all over again. It was the right pick for me. I miss it. Congrats on getting in!   Iowa City is a \"small midwestern town\", but I think it has a much different atmosphere than what many would consider \"small town\" (your description of \"lovely\" is a great way to describe it here). Campus and the city are fairly integrated with each other, with the downtown area of Iowa City being across the street from the main part of campus. If you haven't been able to visit yet, I highly suggest visiting and exploring the city - I personally know several people who decided to go to Iowa after they saw the city and campus in-person. Ask the University about a visit - it's a great way to get a chance to see campus and check out classes and the downtown area.    I think the IC/Coralville area has around 100,000 people, and there is no lack of amenities. One of the cool things about a town of this size is we have a good mix of local businesses in the downtown area, but if you go out to Coralville we still have all of the big national retailers and restaurant chains. Transportation is pretty good here, with a free bus system on campus and two other bus systems to get around town. Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Des Moines are all within an afternoon's driving distance.    There is the whole party scene (bars, house parties, fraternities and sororities, etc...), but there's also a ton of other things going on around campus and the Iowa City area. [Here's](afterclass.uiowa.edu) a good place to start, and you'll find out about places around town that host their own events, too. Iowa City has a lot of festivals throughout the year. The best parties I've been to have been with people I've met through other activities, not just partying for the sake of partying. Parties are a part of living on any college campus, Iowa just happens to get the reputation tacked on because we're a Big Ten school in a smaller state.    There's also something like 500 student orgs on campus (check out OrgSync on Iowa's website for info) and it's relatively easy to start a new org if you have something specific you think people will like. During the first couple weeks of each semester, lots of the student organizations will hold welcome events that are open to everyone, don't be shy about checking out things you might be interested in. Also, there are plenty of off-campus organizations in the greater IC area that may not be through the university.    I took a couple theater classes as an undergrad, and from my experience I don't think the program is \"separate\" any more than any other program is. You will have gen ed classes with people from every program. I was not a part of the theater program here though, so I can't speak for sure on that.   I was a member of Greek Life as an indergraduate, but I never considered it to be the most important aspect of my social life. If you want to join greek life, the options are there and you can make it your whole social life if you want to, but keep in mind that you can have an amazing social life with or without greek life here. You will get out of any social activities what you put into them.   To answer your last question, I liked it so much as an undergrad that I came back to school as a grad student when I started missing Iowa City - so I am doing it all over again! <eos> \n","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9988}\n","neutral\n","Generated comments: Hi All.

Then yeah sure send me some pics...I'll be by November 7th for a transfer day..maybe I can check it out then as well. :) <eos> \n","<bos> [url link] Does it allow dogs? <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a former employee and I never had to do a drug test. But I did have to get a TB test and a flu shot every year. <eos> \n","<bos> Hopefully you've already seen this: [url link] East side (main campus side): Burge has recently been expanded and so there are some brand new suites (shared bathroom between two two-person rooms) that are very nice. The east-side cafeteria is also there, which is convenient so that you don't have to go outside. There is also a C-store (like a convenience store that you can use hawk dollars at). The floors with suites are coed, otherwise it is separated by floor. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall.  Daum is the honors dorm, next to Burge. It's pretty quiet. There didn't used to be a front desk there, which is inconvenient, but I think they were trying to change that. It is connected to the Belin-Blank building which has an ITC (computer lab). The bathrooms and showers of Daum are private like someone else said, which is an incredible bonus. Also, the residents use an actual key instead of a prox card for entry.  Currier and Stanley are connected and sit on the side of Burge opposite of Daum. The buildings are both older (e.g. my dad lived in C and afaik neither has been remodeled.) There is a ITC (computer lab) in Currier and a fitness center. The cambus route stops in front of Currier.  West-side (across the river from the pentacrest and most of campus): Hillcrest contains the west-side cafeteria and 24-hour fitness room. There is also an ITC (computer lab). Most of the underclassmen athletes live there. The building can be very confusing at first and there is not much uniformity between room size or layout. The floors may be coed, in that one wing may be guys and another wing on the same floor girls. The doors here stay unlocked longer hours than other dorms because of the dining hall. Quadrangle is the first dorm built at Iowa and is pretty ancient. This is where I lived for a year. There is talks to tear it down. One wing of Quad has been remodeled recently and is very nice. All rooms in the building are very large, largest I've seen on campus, as the triples are now doubles etc. However, since the architecture of the rooms is funky, they are not able to have air conditioning units in all the rooms. I lived in one of the towers of Quad, in a corner room without a/c, and it was humongous compared to Slater or Rienow. Quad is also only two stories tall (except for the towers) but the only elevator is on the other side of the building, which I never visited. The guys lived in one half of the building (both floors) and the girls on the other. Slater and Reinow are the identical towers on the west side. Reinow is next to Quad and Slater is across the street. The Cambus stops in front of Reinow when coming from downtown (campus), and stops in front of Slater when going to campus. The rooms are fairly small in the towers, but since the floors are more defined, people tend to get to know their neighbors better, which in my opinion is more fun and easier for adjustment. The floors tend to alternate between all guys or all girls. One difference of Reinow is that it has carpeted floors where Slater does not. South Dubuque Street: Mayflower used to be a huge apartment complex that the university bought because of demand. All the rooms are suites with two people per room and two rooms sharing a kitchen and bathroom. There is a fitness center, ITC, and c-store. You also aren't required to have a full meal plan if you live in Mayflower. Many students detest the distance of Mayflower from campus, but the buses do run between regularly. Personally, I feel that living in Mayflower keeps student from getting the most out of the Iowa experience, because you are not constantly part of the majority of campus life and events.  There is a tunnel between Reinow and Quad and between Daum and Burge. There are many living learning communities, with a multitude of topics, which is something to look into to if you'd like support from peers for a major (premed, music, dental etc.) or a passion (environmentalism, LGBT, leadership etc.). [url link] I liked living on the west side because it allowed me to 'go home' from campus and even though it was just across the river, it felt like a community and I didn't find it too inconvenient except for maybe in the winter. The cambuses inevitably get off schedule, but with the ebongo system, you can literally see where the buses are at on their route and expected arrival time. Obviously, the east side has proximity in its favor. All the dorms have wireless internet and sinks in the rooms. The provided lofts are all universal. Also, you will find people who like to party no matter where you are. I can't believe I just wrote this all out but if you have any more questions let me know. I'm a junior here right now and I work at the ITS Help Desk (just on reddit at work nbd). <eos> \n","<bos> Congratulations! The social scene for underclassmen is mainly house parties. For upperclassmen it is more about the bars. Of course, all students go to bars and all students will go to some house parties while there. Tailgate parties are another huge event. I have been to some tailgates with well over 300 people. I was never in Greek life, but for those that were, it definitely was a huge part of their life. Iowa City is a smaller town (about 100k people including students), but it is quaint and there is a lot to do. I would certainly go to Iowa all over again. It was the right pick for me. I miss it. Congrats on getting in!   Iowa City is a \"small midwestern town\", but I think it has a much different atmosphere than what many would consider \"small town\" (your description of \"lovely\" is a great way to describe it here). Campus and the city are fairly integrated with each other, with the downtown area of Iowa City being across the street from the main part of campus. If you haven't been able to visit yet, I highly suggest visiting and exploring the city - I personally know several people who decided to go to Iowa after they saw the city and campus in-person. Ask the University about a visit - it's a great way to get a chance to see campus and check out classes and the downtown area.    I think the IC/Coralville area has around 100,000 people, and there is no lack of amenities. One of the cool things about a town of this size is we have a good mix of local businesses in the downtown area, but if you go out to Coralville we still have all of the big national retailers and restaurant chains. Transportation is pretty good here, with a free bus system on campus and two other bus systems to get around town. Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Des Moines are all within an afternoon's driving distance.    There is the whole party scene (bars, house parties, fraternities and sororities, etc...), but there's also a ton of other things going on around campus and the Iowa City area. [Here's](afterclass.uiowa.edu) a good place to start, and you'll find out about places around town that host their own events, too. Iowa City has a lot of festivals throughout the year. The best parties I've been to have been with people I've met through other activities, not just partying for the sake of partying. Parties are a part of living on any college campus, Iowa just happens to get the reputation tacked on because we're a Big Ten school in a smaller state.    There's also something like 500 student orgs on campus (check out OrgSync on Iowa's website for info) and it's relatively easy to start a new org if you have something specific you think people will like. During the first couple weeks of each semester, lots of the student organizations will hold welcome events that are open to everyone, don't be shy about checking out things you might be interested in. Also, there are plenty of off-campus organizations in the greater IC area that may not be through the university.    I took a couple theater classes as an undergrad, and from my experience I don't think the program is \"separate\" any more than any other program is. You will have gen ed classes with people from every program. I was not a part of the theater program here though, so I can't speak for sure on that.   I was a member of Greek Life as an indergraduate, but I never considered it to be the most important aspect of my social life. If you want to join greek life, the options are there and you can make it your whole social life if you want to, but keep in mind that you can have an amazing social life with or without greek life here. You will get out of any social activities what you put into them.   To answer your last question, I liked it so much as an undergrad that I came back to school as a grad student when I started missing Iowa City - so I am doing it all over again! <eos> \n","<bos> Giant Sloth in the Natural History Museum The university was one of the first institutions in America to grant a law degree to a woman (Mary B. Hickey Wilkinson, 1873), to grant a law degree to an African American (G.

They have a ton of really nice equipment (cameras, lights, mics, editing stations) that they will train you on and allow you to check out (for use on SVP shows or SVP sponsored contests), and have a ton of shows for you to help on, from studio 3-camera talk shows to dramas. Great way to get experience. It's also a great way to meet other cinema majors and network- they have a fantastic alumni network who are working in film and video across the country, and they have a Contracts department where you can make some money filming and editing events for university and community groups. I am not currently using my cinema degree, but if I was, it would be entirely because of SVP- I learned basically everything I know from that group. Great opportunity for aspiring filmmakers. <eos> \n","<bos> maybe...maybe in time. Go Hawks. Eh, it's cool. I found it funny, others didn't.

I just graduated with a dual major in Comp Sci and German actually, so I did a fairly similar path.  For groups/activities, I highly recommend joining the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) club, they have regular meetings (bi-weekly, I think?) which are great for meeting people who are likely to share some of your interests. They also provide a lot of career help, host an annual computing convention, travel to various events, and a bunch of other things. I'm not sure how the Japanese department specifically is, but my experience with the Foreign Language departments in general has been great as well. If Japanese is anything like the German department, it's likely fairly small and tight-knit, which means you will get to know other people in your major really well as you will be in a lot of courses together. Also due to the size of the departments, there's little to no competition for study abroad programs. I went abroad twice (once for a semester, once for a year) and had an incredible experience. Would absolutely recommend checking to see what kinds of exchange programs they have available. You may even be able to get resident credit while abroad so it won't delay or otherwise interrupt your studies.  Sororities though... Meh. I rushed my sophomore year and didn't have a great experience. It's a highly organized event spread over 2-3 weekends, where you dress up and visit all the sororities on campus in several rounds of a matching process. After each round you rank and get ranked by the different sororities, with the lowest ranked girls not getting an offer to come back, until you either have been eliminated from all of them or have been selected to join one. I felt it to be very impersonal and superficial and dropped out after the first weekend. I do have some friends who had a totally opposite experience and ended up in a sorority that they loved though, so YMMV.  Hope that helps your decision a bit! <eos> \n","<bos> Iowa City is liberal af Hey! I'm a poli sci Phd at u Iowa (and actually did my masters at Stony Brook!) PM me and I can help out!

The school has a reputation as being one of the top party colleges in the nation every year (Princeton Review) but like anything, if you’re not into that there’s plenty else to do. The surrounding IC area revolves around supporting the university and the athletic teams. Football, basketball and wrestling are the most popular sports around here. I’d say that the cultural arts here are above average as well but just get less recognition.  I’ve lived in numerous states and cities and I can say without a doubt that attending Iowa (2015 grad) and living in Iowa City was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. It’s a great university, incredible place to live, and the people are all pretty understanding and respectful. 10/10 would recommend! <eos> \n","<bos> Get a car. I would not want to try to use the city bus as my sole transportation, especially for grocery shopping/Target runs. You will be happy to have a car, and there are some fun things to do outside of downtown Iowa City. Current professor at Iowa -- I only use a car in the coldest winter months (January and February). I bike the rest of the time. Parking can be rough, especially on the coldest or snowy days; everyone drives on those days. A car is not a necessity for school, but it is a necessity if you want to get away from campus. It's a pretty spread-out campus, so if you drive the few blocks to a parking spot, then you'll probably end up walking a few blocks to get to class, anyways. Iowa City is a pretty pedestrian-friendly place, so reasons to get a car: * You don't live near campus and don't want to rely on the bus system/taxis. * You will be traveling to another town regularly. * Convenience for groceries, shopping, seeing friends who don't live near campus, job, etc. * You will often have to move heavy stuff. Bad reasons to get a car: * Getting around campus, minus a few very far-flung buildings (the art building, for example). Personally, I've had a car as long as I've been here, but my first year it was just so I could go out of town a lot and it was parked in the storage lot. I also went through a brief period of time that I couldn't drive, and since I live in Coralville now, it really sucked when I had to be somewhere on a Sunday or somewhere off-campus. <eos> \n","<bos> I finished almost 10 years ago so I dont know current profs/courses.

For an example, I know a frat has had their recruits eat raw food and then get locked in a closest with bottles of vodka. They weren't allowed out until they finished it too.  Also, people are down voting me because the frat scene at UoI is trying to change. There's been so many problems in the past that none of the frats want to be associated with it. It still happens though. What's the hazing like?

If you're just staying on campus, [Cambus]([url link] which is a university operated transit system, will get you anywhere and it is free.  If you are going off campus, then [Iowa City Transit]([url link] or [Coralville]([url link] Transit will take you pretty much anywhere in the Iowa City/ Coralville area for $1.   You can easily navigate Iowa City, especially the UoI campus, without a car. There are (a bit pricey) grocery stores on campus that you can get to without one as well. Honestly, it's easier without a car because street parking is a pain. Most of the streets around campus don't allow no over night parking, and all parking downtown is metered or in a paid ramp.  Street parking also switches which side of the street you can park on, depending if it is an even or odd day. This means you have to move your car to the other side of the street every day. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a PhD student rather than an undergrad, so I can't really answer your main question about classes (I guess I've been a TA for an undergrad lab class, and most of those students were decent), but since you seem interested in academics in general and someone said you're planning on a biology major, I have some unsolicited general advice that will apply regardless of where you end up. It also applies to any psychology and most other hard sciences as well, and is a good way to put yourself in a very academic setting regardless of how your classes go. The most important thing you can do as a science/social science major is to do research, and it helps a lot to start early. It's basically required to have some if you plan to go the academics/grad school route, but it's very useful for med school or going straight into industry as well. Having legitimately strong experience over 4 years of college, rather than just a semester or summer of research just to check off a requirement is huge, and will go *much* farther than grades on a grad school application (basically every grad school would take a B average student with strong research experience and a strong recommendation from their PI over an A average with \"meh\" research). As long as you're legitimately interested and actually understand what you're doing and why you're doing it, it's absolutely huge on an application/during interviews. Same goes for med school applications, though it's not really a requirement there so much as a nice bonus. As far as industry goes, they mostly care that you learned and mastered a wide variety of techniques, but undergrad research is still the easiest way to get that. A lot of people I knew as an undergrad (myself included) were sort of intimidated to email a random professor and ask them if you could join their lab, but it's the easiest way to do it. There may be job listings where people can find open lab spaces, but I guarantee most professors (especially one who isn't a really big name at the university) would be extremely flattered and impressed to get an email from an undergrad saying they're interested in their work. There are tons of labs at UI doing quality research, so there are plenty of opportunities. Just browse faculty listings in whatever department you're interested in, read their brief research descriptions until you find some that sound interesting (*tons* of extra points if you make an attempt to read some of their published papers, even if a lot of it won't make much sense to you straight out of high school), and send some people an email. Some people might tell you they have no space, but *a lot* of professors I know would take an undergrad who showed genuine interest, even if they weren't really looking for one already. I seriously think that finding a professor this way (as opposed to finding their job listing) will make them instantly like you, since most of them absolutely love when people take interest in their research. As long as you send a relatively polite, formal email, explain what research experience you have (it's fine if that's none), and show genuine interest, I guarantee they'll respond positively.  If you want to be paid for your work make sure you specify that (it may close some doors, but probably not too many) and make it clear that you're aware you won't get directly into the research right away, and will spend a year or so as a glorified dish washer (and media/buffer maker) before you're really trusted to have your own projects. If you don't need money at all, you *might* be able to get straight into the research, but it really depends on the professor. Most are more accustomed to paying undergrads and having them work their way up to research. It's definitely something you have to legitimately be committed to, since grad students/postdocs/professors will get *really* annoyed if an undergrad is flaky or otherwise inconsistent with their hours (though we totally understand when there are emergencies or you have exams and let us know in advance). If you really want to impress your lab (which you should, if you want a great rec and the best research opportunities), you should try to attend their lab meetings if they happen at a time when you don't have class. It's extra effort and I know I didn't exactly love it as an undergrad. but it's something most undergrads don't volunteer to do and most professors wont tell you to do, so it really shows extra interest/dedication and makes you look good. Anyway, this is overly long for unsolicited advice, but I wish I would've known this stuff when I first came into college so I figured I'd give it anyway. If you end up at Iowa and are interested in anyone on the biomedical side of things or want some recommendations, PM me when that time comes and I'd be happy to help. Good luck with wherever you end up. <eos> \n","<bos> peterson is the 2nd newest dorm and is like 3 years old. it’s really really nice! has pod bathrooms which is great. the only downside is no kitchen so you can’t make your own food.

Some students have also had just random customer service type jobs around town.

Can't speak to anywhere else, but I know firsthand that the Yacht Club does have open mic night, and it's a very good music scene. You won't have any trouble meeting musician friends and getting to know the scene if you start there. The Mill is also good.  3. Try calling Aspire at West Campus - if you can afford the relatively pricey rent, I know they're looking for roommates for certain people and the housing is only for graduate students. Other than that take a look at Craigslist. Stay away from the Broadway street area -- if you have questions about whether or not an area is good to live in, post in /r/iowacity and ask about it.

I transferred to UIowa hoping to do the same, but decided to do something else. As of right now there is no definitive animation program (they hope to have one in the next 2ish years). The best thing you can do is major in something related (computer science, drawing, or graphic design are good options depending on what exactly within animation you want to do) and teach yourself the rest. There are animation classes you can take in the School of Art and Art History that will teach you the basics and introduce you to programs such as After Effects, Maya, and Flash. You can also join a student org such as EPX where artists and engineers partner up to make animations and videogames. EPX also hosts EPXcon, an annual event where you can meet with industry professionals. Also, as a UIowa student you get a free subscription to Lynda.com (which I highly recommend), check out digitaltutors.com as well, and for added practice 11secondclub.com is a great site. Education will only get you so far especially with in creative fields (source: myself, graphic designer in the real world.) Work hard, put together a phenomenal demo reel, and apply for ALL the internships paid or not. Most likely, your first one won't be paid. It sucks, but that's how it goes. Experience and networking is everything! Best of luck! ps: I'd also recommend taking an acting class and a film class. They'll help with little things like movement, facial expressions, and camera angles. edit: I want to add that if you decide to declare a major in art you are required to take Basic Drawing and Design Fundamentals. From there you must take a number of 2d courses, 3d courses, and art history courses. If you want a BFA, you'll take all the previously mentioned number of classes plus going to BFA clearance in your discipline, organizing a senior gallery exhibition your last semester, and taking additional advanced classes in your discipline.  Make sure you don't take too many studio courses per semester. They are much more time consuming than most people think. Most advisors (and pretty much everyone else) suggests not taking more than 2 per semester. I transferred with all my gen eds done, so all I had left were art courses... I spent MANY nights in the art buildings trying not to cry. <eos> \n","<bos> The vine on 2nd Street is always crowded and has people to meet.

If you have to much free time you'll spend it all doing stuff like drinking, gaming, generally screwing around. Getting involved helps to keep you busy and focused plus it builds your resume.  Also, the 10 o'clock ordinance at the bars is pretty strictly enforced. Every minute you stay past ten you risk getting a ticket. If cops should walk in, act like youre 21. Don't try to hide your drink behind you or scoot it across the table or generally act suspicious because that's exactly what they're looking for. As far as stuff to bring goes, collaborate with your roommate if you have one. \"I'll bring the fridge if you bring the microwave and TV\" is a great way to save money. Definitely bring flip flops for the dorm showers, unless you want athlete foot and other peoples bodily fluids between your toes. <eos> \n","<bos> I do. But I'm an alum.

Everyone in both the engineering and honors departments are super nice and will work with you to help you graduate with Honor in C.S.E. if that's what you want to do. Don't be scared that you won't be able to do it--its actually more manageable than you may think and you have advisers helping you every step of the way. 😊 As for switching to an alternative (honors CS or honorsless BSE), that is up to you, but I would definitely give honors CSE a shot first! If you ended up making a switch in your academic plan, it would likely be early enough to where gen eds would transfer just because of how the honors program works. Hope this helped! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! Congrats on being accepted to Iowa and the honors program! <eos> \n","<bos> Yeah, there aren't a ton of good options for someone on a college budget. There's something of a monopoly when it comes to near-campus apartments. Honestly though, I rented from apartments downtown for three years and had no issues. Sure, the unit itself was overpriced and the building was a bit run-down, but they were good about fixing things (I got a brand new stove and fridge when mine started being wonky), pretty responsive when I had issues, and I got the majority of my deposit back. Your mileage may vary of course, and I know there are horror stories out there, but I've never personally known anyone who had major issues with renting from one of these companies. <eos> \n","<bos> I would recommend calling the front desk of the building where the package will be delivered. They may be able to help you. When you check out of your dorm you have to fill out a card that has your forwarding address on it. It should get to her, just later than you expect to account for the forwarding. <eos> \n","<bos> Because no one wants to interact with them outside of other greek life people. I used to run the Phi Psi tailgate house on Valley Ave by Carver Hawkeye... without ever being a member of the frat. Three of my roommates were members but I was not and never got any shit for not being in Phi Psi. In fact, pledges used to come clean my house for me on Sundays. Also, my non-Phi Psi friends (which were most of my friends) were never denied a cup/beer. At any point. This isn't ISU. Frats are NOT a big deal at Iowa. <eos> \n","<bos> Theres some pics from twitter [here]([url link] but I don't think they are wallpaper sized images.

You'll have more fun knowing an RA isn't listening on the other side of the door. It's also cheaper than dorms, which never hurts. Also you'll run the risk of having the same problem as before. Any of my friends that stayed in the dorms sophomore year just ended up hanging out at other friends' apartments. I had the same experience with dorm floors three years in a row, with nobody being social. I really wish I had lived off-campus sooner. If you don't feel like you have a good friend group, dorms are a great way to make friends. Try looking into different living learning communities to live with people with similar interests, and try roommate searches to find someone better for you to live with. I moved out my sophomore year, as it can be cheaper, but I think I would have made more friends and would have been happier in the dorms. Good luck. Don't think of leaving the dorms as \"cutting your losses.\" I was beyond happy when my first year was over and I could move out of that tiny room. You'll definitely enjoy living in an apartment/house of campus with you're friends more than living in a dorm for another year. <eos> \n","<bos> Anything taught by Jeffrey Hart is an easy A I had him for 3 classes (investment mgmt, wealth mgmt, fixed income securities) and 95% of the material in each class was exactly the same. There's 3 tests and a project and that's it. The tests are a joke (multiple choice, half the questions are ripped straight from the book) and the project can be done in 30 minutes. Warning: He's a hardcore libertarian and a 9/11 truther, so some of his tangents might be offensive at times, but you learn to roll your eyes at it. Alternatively if you're looking for a challenge, Applied Equity Valuation is by far the hardest and most time consuming course available in the finance major, but you will learn a lot and Todd Houge is a fantastic professor. <eos> \n","<bos> They'll email you with instructions when it's time to pick. When I did it two years ago we got to choose our dorm and room, I just got the roommate who also chose that room. I assume it'll be the same this year. Returning students get first pick of the dorms so Catlett and Peterson will be mostly picked over but honestly they're hyped IMO. I was in Hillcrest and I loved it. All the dorms are good but Mayflower is a trek as I'm sure you know. You can't really go wrong with any of them. Plus with the old dorms you get a sink in your room which is nice.  Also, Hillcrest G45 is a double that's notably bigger than any of the triples on that floor if you're trying to get a stupidly large dorm room ;) <eos> \n","<bos> They did a few years ago for the first \"snowpocalypse.\" But, they didn't cancel until about 20 minutes before my first class,so I wouldn't have even known if it wasn't for my neighbor coming out while I was attempting to shovel out my car. There are weird rules that have to do with financial aid etc. that keep them from cancelling. Professors are generally pretty chill in weather like this if you email them ahead of time and tell them you can't make it because of the snow.   They also cancelled for the flood and when a tornado hit downtown IC, but that was before my time. Good luck tomorrow! <eos> \n","<bos> Repellent to deal with all the fucking gnats. The cheesiest thing ever but true: A positive attitude. You really don't need to bring too much. I guess possibly a camera, but other than that you really don't need much. You're going to be spending quite a bit of time moving around, so don't bring anything more than you absolutely need. Oh, and be sure to take advantage of the 1 credit online classes like managing your money and online at Iowa. Finished both of them within the first three days of college and got two credits. And just out of curiosity, what is your major? Being you will be signing up for classes, there might be some people (including me) that could help steer you in the right direction for classes. Best of luck and welcome to University of Iowa! <eos> \n","<bos> 1. Did you apply for University housing? 2. It's on a first come, first serve basis. If you did apply for university housing, you should be able to pick out of what's left, as I believe most of the dorms have been picked over by now. 3. The bars downtown are usually packed Thursday through Saturday night. They will all card you, but if you're under 21, you can be in certain bars until 10 pm. A lot of people have fakes, and they're pretty lenient on them, depending on the bouncer. 4. No. The campus is very walkable. If you live on the East side, anywhere that you'll need to go is never more than a ten minute walk away. 5. Usually $5 for guys, free for girls. Some parties charge girls too, though. Some parties might be more expensive. Like some frats charge $40 for non-members to get into their football tailgates. Hope that helps! Go Hawks! <eos> \n","<bos> I've used Mediacom during my time here and usually Mediacom is really slow compared to their advertised speeds I have had century Link and Mediacom. Both have shit customer service, but my experience has been better with Mediacom. Additionally, Mediacom offers speeds much faster than Century Link, but it is more expensive.  Unrequested advice: buy your own modem. They charger $10 a month rental, so just buy your own for $100 bucks and then in 10 months you have broken even, I assume you will have internet for more than 10 months, so it's a safe investment. <eos> \n","<bos> For breakfast Pullman’s. For lunch Nodo is amazing, graze buffet is awesome and so is shorts. Dinner you gotta go to Saloon or Formosa! I love Formosa (Sushi), Bluebird (American Diner), Hamburg Inn (American), and Casa Azul (Mexican)! La Regia on the south side of town has some of the most perfect tacos I've had the pleasure of eating in Iowa. It's a tiny little dive in a strip mall, but order the asada tacos.  Also, if you're there on a saturday morning then definitely check out the farmers market. It's the perfect size, and has some amazing food vendors as well. <eos> \n","<bos> Already took it through a community college lol. Can confirm, very easy PHIL1033 The meaning of life. Easiest A of my entire college career and actually super interesting sometimes Take a medical terminology class online. You literally just copy and paste answers in online tests. I took the course through kirkwood though so it was cheaper. I think the U Iowa class might require you to go to a testing center. It was an automatic A <eos> \n","<bos> No, but you might be able to use your family's info from back home. Nope! Well darn, but thanks for your help! I guess so, I'll have to check in with them.

And to answer your question, yes and yes. The hardest part about freshman year is learning to balance your coursework and social life (especially during football season). Really, if you want to do Crossfit, just schedule your time it as if you would otherwise be spending 1-2 hours at the gym on those days, which is not only feasible, but highly recommended for stress relief and not gaining a ton of weight freshman year from all of the cafeteria food and cheap beer. <eos> \n","<bos> Amazon is your friend, if only to price check with the local bookstores. If you're not doing that, I guarantee you're overpaying. Check your ICON page for syllabuses that have been uploaded under the content sections for each of your courses. Often, you can also go onto ISIS and there will be a link under each of your course pages to the Hawk Shop or Iowa Book. I usually follow the link to the sites and look up my course numbers there to find out the ISBN number, then copy that onto amazon to find a cheaper, used copy. <eos> \n","<bos> Walking it will be faster than any bus. Should probably take a bit more than five minutes if you walk with a good pace. A decent pace to a brisk walk will get you there easily in quicker time than what Google predicts (~3mph rate). I used to always make it on time from walking between EPB and Van Allen. Enjoy the steep hills between Madison and Capitol. As for a bus. If you see on Bongo if there's an eastbound Pentacrest bus at EPB exactly when your class ends you can take that to MacBride. But sometimes the light at Iowa and Madison is annoyingly long but you should make it.  Otherwise don't, as a 10 minute walk is easy. Also, if you're dealing with lecture halls being late isn't as 'bad' as being late for small classroom. No professor/TA should care but you can always tell them your situation and they'd understand. Honestly I don't think I've ever seen anyone receive grief for being 1-2 minutes late. Welcome to the world of college. And enjoy Iowa. <eos> \n","<bos> I think your biggest worry should be finding a parking spot lol Man, Iowa IS too safe to believe. Obviously bad things happen everywhere, but for four years neither me nor any of my friends have had any issue, day or night. Like anywhere. Be smart, stay in well lit areas, and no harm will come to you.  Looking back it is a very understated part of going to Iowa. I used to Park at the City Park Pool and walk down to the IMU. Free parking and you can't get much safer than Iowa City. Don't leave expensive belongs sitting out in your car of course. If you want to exercise I suggest parking in the Old Capitol ramp nearby the new rec center you will have a membership too as a student. First hour is free and .75c hour after. <eos> \n","<bos> People always dress up for the game. <eos> \n","<bos> I worked at Brothers back in the summer of 09, granted it's been a long time, I don't think much has changed. You'll start out at the bottom of the food chain but depending on where you're at in life you may like it. You'll work every weekend probably but as I said, depends if you want to make money or party. When I worked there I wanted to party, so I didn't like working until 3 or 4 am. However, did after hours sometimes and if you stay long enough you'll get in with others in the service industry (I did not stay long enough). Eventually you'll become a bar back and then bartender where you'll make absolute bank, especially for being a younger person. Save it. Anyways, working was what you'd expect for a typical college bar. Lots of drunk assholes. I was security to begin with, as are all guys, basically walk around picking up glasses and bottles and keeping everything looking good and relatively calm. I got so bored, definitely wasn't for me. I ended up bartending at a non college bar for 3 years and loved it. Stick it out and it'll be well worth it. Also, idk about now but we cleaned until 330 most nights, but is probably better because they got new floors. I think bartenders did the bar and the barbacks and servers stocked everything and cleaned the bathrooms. Also got 50 percent off food and liquor on off days, plus front of line privileges and never paid cover. <eos> \n","<bos> No there's tons more to do you'll love it! Clubs for everything an amazing gym! Pretty much anything you could want I was in a frat but then dropped because of $$$. With that said, the Greek scene is great, it's big enough to enjoy if you're interested in being a part of it; but it's not so big that it hurts at all to be outside of it. <eos> \n","<bos> Governor's Mansion used to be the big one, but the guy who owned the house left Iowa City on rape accusations last year so rip Gov's.

It's paid monthly and taxed in the [second bracket listed here]([url link] to the best of my understanding. The university requires that we be paid via direct deposit, and most people set theirs up so that the UI withholds the tax as that happens. You are paid on the first of the month from Sept 1 through June 1 if you are on a nine month contract. Your TA contract must specifically state you have summer funding or you will not be paid July 1 and August 1. Most TA’s do not receive summer funding. <eos> \n","<bos> It's even more specific than that: you cannot have more than 50% athletes per floor. I believe a dorm can't be more than 50% athlete, according to the NCAA. So I bet it's close to that. Hillcrest is certainly the best dorm for the 'all around' college dorm experience. It seems 50/50 to me and houses 900+ students if I recall correctly. Lived at Hillcrest two years, athletes didn't necessarily 'keep to their own teams' or what have you. The distribution of athletes tends to be in certain wings of the building, by team, but there are always 'Normie' students intermingled every other room or so. They try pretty hard to prevent excessive benefits so it makes sense. The new athletic dorm will be the same way for lucky students who wan't to pay extra. <eos> \n"]}]}]}
