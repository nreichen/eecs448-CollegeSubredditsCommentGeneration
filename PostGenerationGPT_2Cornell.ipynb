            "comment_utter <bos> The biggest difference between project teams directed towards competition and those that aren't are that competition based teams are very iteration based, you don't work on many new things and won't really have the chance to work on things from scratch and experience the design process. Otherwise, you build something completely new.  You can always accept the offer and drop if you get into another team, although that would reflect rather badly on you if you applied again later on. But as a freshman, almost any project team will be a good learning experience. If you're interested in the project team, go ahead. However, if you like another team more but you commit to the first one, you may be left wondering what if you made it onto the other. <eos> \n",

Not an MEng, but current MechE undergrad at Cornell.  From my understanding, the MEng is pretty flexible as long as you’re taking 5xxx course or higher. The degree is coursework based. If you want to be submersed in aerospace, take the aero classes. Take a look at the course roster and see if there are enough classes you’re interested in to fill up 30 credit hours (some hours will be the project though of course).  There is a specific aero propulsion class offered taught by Fischer, i believe. Other courses that would probably be good for you are FEA with Ritz and CFD.  I did an internship at a large aerospace company over the summer, and I know a lot of other students who did internships/are going on to work full time for similar companies. The Cornell brand carries a decent amount of weight and aerospace companies recruit here a lot.  From the very little I know about your situation I think cornell would be a good option for you. The MEng is a popular choice for Cornell MechE undergrads after they graduate, as it only takes a year and it does boost your desirability.\n",

The calculus requirements aren't really reflective of anything you'll need in CS, unless you decide to do a few specific subfields (scientific computing comes into mind, usually).

If your primary interest is programming/development, however, maybe consider info sci. as an alternative? It's a lot more flexible than CS and you can pretty much take as many CS courses as you'd like still, without as many theory CS/math related requirements. I'm not sure if I can in good conscience suggest pursuing CS if it's getting to the point where your classes are cutting into your ability to enjoy your social life/hobbies at all, though. I know people like to go off about how busy they are all the time (especially CS/Engineers) but academics should not consume all of your waking hours. It's important to enjoy yourself, too.

However, the office status is dependent on the house, some are currently manned by conference services for summer programs and some are closed/limited- either way I would not anticipate it getting forwarded. It might be worth checking in closer to the start of the semester as activity starts to ramp up but I would not be worried about it actually getting to the office so you should be able to receive it as soon as you arrive. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  Every sorority at Cornell does formal recruitment in the spring. That's when you'll have the groups of girls traveling in packs from house to house together. If a house doesn't make quota during the spring, they will usually have informal recruitment during the fall the following semester. However, if there is a particular house you're interested in, fall recruitment evening happening is not a given. Also, in the fall you generally have to be invited to recruitment events by an active sister in the house, while during spring recruitment every house is open to everyone. In general, it's MUCH easier to form real connections with the active girls in the fall because the events are longer and less crowded, so you get more one-on-one time to form a connection. However, fall recruitment has less opportunities overall and is trickier to get in to.  Source: I'm a Rho Gamma currently deactivated from my sorority.

And I'd recommend keeping yourself extremely comfortable with at least one programming language, that you'll always be comfortable enough to use in interviews without really needing to think about syntax.

You have office hours, tutors, supplemental courses...Don't feel like you need to hold onto your pride. If you're struggling in a course, get help! You're going to take a beating on your first round of prelims (what Cornellians call midterms). That's perfectly normal; most Cornellians will receive worse scores than they expect on their first round of exams. It isn't the end of the world. Use it as a learning experience to figure out what worked and what didn't work, and where you need to improve most.  Figure out time management earlier, rather than later. Effectively planning out your time will do wonders for your productivity. Don't forget to schedule some down time, but don't let it eat into your study time either! Doing problem sets until 5 in the morning before your 8am class is not a healthy or effective plan! Speaking of 8am-ers, don't. College is a very different beast from high school, and you'll find you have a lot more freedom to choose what you want to do. Of course, with that freedom, you need to figure out how to effectively utilize your time and also accept the consequences of the actions you may or may not choose to do. Remember: you're an adult now, and you'll be treated as one by everybody around you, which includes professors, staff, and cops! If you see someone who you think is drugged out of their mind or so drunk that they can't walk, call CUPD. Hell, if you think someone may need help at all, call CUPD. New York has a Good Samaritan Law that protects both you and the drugged out person from legal repercussions that result from that drugged out state (e.g. underage drinking). You find someone passed out in front of your dorm? Call CUPD. Your roommate starts vomiting because he drank too much? Call CUPD. Witness some sketchy business that could be somebody taking advantage of a drunk person? Call CUPD. Do your part as a good Cornellian, and watch each other's backs!  Related to the above tip, if EMS shows up and ask you if you've been drinking or doing drugs, tell the truth. We aren't out to get you in trouble, and lying to us will only hinder or delay the care we can provide to you. Also, we can tell when you're drunk or high. You can't fool us. Bonus tip! For the pot smokers: don't smoke in your dorm. Yes, the RAs know what it smells like. Yes, the RAs are contractually obligated to call CUPD if they smell pot. Yes, you do get a JA for it. Don't be dumb, and at least try to be discrete about it.\n",

            "commented_here  First, I would speak with your academic advisor or your college's advising dean to get a sense of what your options are. They are there to help you in these types of situations, and they recommend taking a semester off or some other recourse. Second, remember that GPA isn't the end-all-be-all of your life. It is possible to be successful with a lower GPA. I was in the same boat as you (though I was too prideful to admit I had mental issues until halfway through the spring semester), and I'm currently in an MS program for epidemiology and biostatistics and doing very well academically. So don't think having a low GPA means you won't be able to succeed later on. Yes, it'll be harder if you intend on going to graduate school, but as long as you show an upward trend, explain what happened in your personal statement, and get good standardized test scores, you'll still get into a reputable program. If you're going to work right after graduation, realize that many employers don't ask for GPA on their applications.  Just take a breather and talk with your advisors. If you think you need some time off to collect yourself and figure things out, then tell them that you're thinking about taking a semester off. Cornell will still be waiting for you, and you'll be in a better position to succeed.\n",

They are there to help you in these types of situations, and they recommend taking a semester off or some other recourse. Second, remember that GPA isn't the end-all-be-all of your life. It is possible to be successful with a lower GPA.

            "commented_here  I grew up a Cornell fan, going to Cornell football, hockey, and lacrosse games, learning the history, traditions, etc.  I was slightly disappointed when I arrived on campus as a student. Don't be surprised if you discover a large portion of students that don't care about Cornell at all, other than being able to tell other people they go to Cornell or complaining about the classes and the weather. It was a bit of a shock to me, having based my judgement on my experiences at Lynah Rink and believing that the whole university cared as much as everybody packed in the stands (half of whom are locals from Ithaca, which is awesome in its own way).  That said, there absolutely is a strong contingent of students devoted to cheering on the Red, famously at Lynah Rink but also in other venues, notably wrestling and lax. Football has sadly fallen by the wayside after many losing seasons, although the homecoming game is always fun and hopefully the program makes a comeback over the next few seasons. If you are the type of person that enjoys school spirit, do your best to avoid getting sucked into the inevitable negativity that you will encounter by students that don't care or don't know any better.  I once brought a friend to Lynah Rink during his senior year, he was amazed at how packed and rowdy the rink was and regretted not getting season tickets as a student. Make sure you get season tickets to hockey (yes you have to pay), and renew every year to get the best seats when you are a sophomore, junior and senior - sections A and B.  I promise no party will compare to the party at Lynah Rink. Go to elynah.com, brush up on traditions, and most importantly, don't let anyone tell you that Cornell students don't care about sports, because they are misinformed. It's not Alabama or Wisconsin or Virginia, but if you make a small effort and ignore the idiots, you will have a great time watching sports at Cornell and have stories for the rest of your life.

In this regard, BEE is pretty good, and the relative freedom in the curriculum has allowed me to take a bunch of courses from various departments that help me out towards this. The research here is also pretty strong. I wouldn't have liked BME due to the more strict curriculum. There's also a pretty strong environmental focus, I think, but there's also EnvE for that in the department. But the courses in BME, from my experience, are better. More rigorous, less hand-wavy, and just more interesting and well taught in general. I feel that many of the major required courses (thermo, 3600, 3310) are better if you take them from another department--3500 is quite good though.

            "commented_here  Remembering literally everything is a very poor study approach in both the arts and the sciences. Here's what I did when I took my history courses. 1. Find and develop the \"big picture\". Each of your readings has a \"big picture\" they want to convey, particularly secondary sources. Try to find this \"big picture\" and see how your reading falls underneath this picture. For example, the \"big picture\" might be to show that the Great Leap Forward was a failure. How does your reading prove (or disprove!) that the Great Leap Forward was a failure? 2. Focus on the primary sources. History professors love primary sources over secondary sources because, well, they're contemporary to the period they're studying! 3. Summarize the key points of the reading. This can usually be done in a paragraph or two. What message did the author want to convey? What context is your reading from? Are there viewpoints in this reading that particularly stand out? Following our previous example, perhaps your reading focuses on the inconsistencies among the CCP leadership, the poor working conditions, and how callous the CCP leadership was. Expand on those points with 3 to 5 sentences from the author's perspective. 4. How are your readings linked? That is, do they conflict with each other? Do they form a timeline? Are they a mix of primary and secondary sources? Are they from opposing sides of history? Since history is told from the eyes of the storyteller, it's really important to keep in mind how these readings relate to each other and the broader historical timeframe.  My recommendation is for every reading to summarize it in a paragraph or two. Depending on what your course is specifically about, perhaps write down one or two sentences that describe how each reading relates to that week's learning goals or the course in general. You often don't need to read the entire thing to get the general picture. It may be helpful to bring in a handful of specific examples from your readings to support your position or expand your understanding. And as always, reach out to your professor to see if they have anything they want you to specifically look for in your readings!\n",

[The Unofficial Cornell CS Wiki has more info.]([url link] You have until midway in the semester to drop a class with no repercussions. So a fair amount of people load up with 20+ credits and drop a bunch of classes about two or three weeks in. I took only the top three classes you listed my first semester because I was worried about adjusting to Cornell. Adjusting to Cornell wasn't too difficult but my semester was still pretty rough simply because of CS 2112. Compared to APCS or other high school level CS work, that class is a huge step upwards in difficulty. The course material isn't bad but the projects are extremely time-consuming. (They lure you into a sense of security with a super easy A1, then truck you with A2, A3, and progressively harder projects). However, you will learn a huge amount of stuff if you put work into the class, especially if you come in with only AP CS knowledge like I did. You'll also hate hexagons for the rest of college. I think that it's worth it only if you're willing and able to put in a lot of effort into it, because the non-honors version CS 2110 is much much easier and you'll learn a lot of the same material (with less project experience). MATH 1920 is very doable as long as you do the homeworks and review before prelims. It has somewhat of a bad rep but I think its difficulty is exaggerated because many students take it as their first Cornell math class having breezed through high school math, expecting it to be the same level. The workload is pretty light. CHEM 2090 is a huge pain in the ass in the fall. Assuming you have Abruña, lectures are probably a worse use of time than just reading the textbook, which is decently written. The professor is a stickler for low means and bell curves and will make the prelims stupidly difficult by packing in so many problems that it's very difficult to finish everything. (After the first prelim had a 62 mean, he insisted that it was too high and so our second prelim had a 48 mean.) On the bright side, you can do poorly on the tests and still be a standard deviation above the mean, and the homeworks don't take long. I think this schedule may be a bit much for the first semester (personally I would drop one class, especially since you have a good amount of AP credit), but you might be great at time management and do fine. And as other responses have mentioned, you can drop a class without penalty until like two months into the semester.\n",

            "commented_here  Apologies for the wall of text as well as for typos (I'm on mobile). For context, I'm a rising junior in Engineering, and am not an international student.  Okay!  When I was in the process of applying to college in high school, the first thing that I looked for in a university was a great undergraduate engineering program. As such, Cornell was on my list from the beginning. I was sure that I wanted to do engineering, but wasn't sure what exactly in engineering I was interested in (CS, materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering were my main interests at the time), so I wanted a university that had a lot of options for when I made up my mind.  In the end, I chose Cornell less for its academic prowess and more for the feeling that I got on my first tour. My dad went to Cornell Engineering for his undergrad, so I had been on campus several times before, but Cornell was the first place where I stepped on campus and felt like I could actually live here for four years. I love the huge campus, and I love the fact that Cornell still feels like a small community in spite of its size. I met and had lunch with students in engineering, and they seemed like people I'd want to spend time with. They didn't fit into the \"engineer\" stereotype, and were able to balance their work with their extracurricular interests. They were also able to take liberal arts classes (I'm into languages and creative writing), which was something that seemed difficult to do at many of the other universities that I attended. So far, I have not been disappointed. I'm a sophomore now, and I've throughly enjoyed my experience at Cornell. I'm a member of four or five clubs, I participate in my residence hall community, I've made friends with some really cool and interesting people, and I work in a research lab doing work that could have significant positive impacts on the medical community. In terms of the student environment, engineering is extremely collaborative. I've made some of my closest friends through homework and group projects that I needed help on. The College of Engineering places a huge focus on collaboration and teamwork, so everyone is always happy to help if you're confused on something, or work on a problem set with you, or study for an exam. I've walked up to random people in Duffield Hall (the engineering social hub) who were working on homework for a class that I was taking, sat down, and asked them if they want to work on it together, and I've never been turned down. Also, I've never been bored. Given that we aren't in a city like NYC, most events/activities occur on campus and are run by student organizations/the university/greek life. At any point in time, there are festivals and athletic events (hockey games are super fun) going on that are open to the public. If you like to go out a lot and party, you can totally do that. Greek life tends to facilitate that, and most of the fraternities are situated very close to campus, so you can go out whenever you want. There are also a few clubs in Collegetown. If you're interested in social outings, there are an infinite number of options for that, especially given that freshmen get a free bus pass. There are fun formal events at the Johnson Museum where everyone gets to dress up, and there's a restaurant/bar near campus that does salsa nights on Wednesdays that I've heard are awesome. We also have things like Slope Day, a giant music festival in the spring. I like the blend of technical and non-technical courses that I get to take in engineering as well. We're required to take 18 credits of liberal studies courses to graduate, which amounts to about six classes over five years. Most freshmen don't take liberal studies courses, so you end up taking one every semester from your third semester on. I came in with a lot of AP credit in the humanities, so I don't have to take all 18 credits (I came in with 12 of the 18 credits), but I'm planning on doing a creative writing minor and taking several French courses. Obviously, our curriculum focuses on the engineering courses, but it is also flexible enough to allow you to take classes outside of engineering . Speaking more generally, food was an important part of my college search, and Cornell has some of the best food I've had in general. I'd recommend the 14 meals/week plan to start, because you may eat breakfast and dinner on North campus as a freshman, and eat something smaller on central campus for lunch. There are a ton of options for food, so you'll never be bored with it (escpecially if you eat on west campus). Statler has the best food on campus IMO, and they have a student run restaurant that does fun themed dinners every week. The food there is amazing, and pretty cheap ($15-20 for an entree and appetizer/dessert).  The dorms are generally pretty nice. North campus has a lot more variance in quality, because the dorms have been build over the past few decades, but everyone I know was happy regardless of where they were. I lived in Dickson, the largest dorm on North, and I loved it. It is mostly singles, which was what I wanted, but it's really social. I made some of my closest friends through my hall. Court-Kay-Bauer and Mews are the nicest/newest, and have air conditioning. Donlon is the party dorm.  I'm going to stop here, but feel free to ask any questions if you have them.\n",

I was sure that I wanted to do engineering, but wasn't sure what exactly in engineering I was interested in (CS, materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering were my main interests at the time), so I wanted a university that had a lot of options for when I made up my mind.  In the end, I chose Cornell less for its academic prowess and more for the feeling that I got on my first tour. My dad went to Cornell Engineering for his undergrad, so I had been on campus several times before, but Cornell was the first place where I stepped on campus and felt like I could actually live here for four years. I love the huge campus, and I love the fact that Cornell still feels like a small community in spite of its size. I met and had lunch with students in engineering, and they seemed like people I'd want to spend time with. They didn't fit into the \"engineer\" stereotype, and were able to balance their work with their extracurricular interests. They were also able to take liberal arts classes (I'm into languages and creative writing), which was something that seemed difficult to do at many of the other universities that I attended. So far, I have not been disappointed. I'm a sophomore now, and I've throughly enjoyed my experience at Cornell. I'm a member of four or five clubs, I participate in my residence hall community, I've made friends with some really cool and interesting people, and I work in a research lab doing work that could have significant positive impacts on the medical community. In terms of the student environment, engineering is extremely collaborative. I've made some of my closest friends through homework and group projects that I needed help on. The College of Engineering places a huge focus on collaboration and teamwork, so everyone is always happy to help if you're confused on something, or work on a problem set with you, or study for an exam. I've walked up to random people in Duffield Hall (the engineering social hub) who were working on homework for a class that I was taking, sat down, and asked them if they want to work on it together, and I've never been turned down. Also, I've never been bored. Given that we aren't in a city like NYC, most events/activities occur on campus and are run by student organizations/the university/greek life. At any point in time, there are festivals and athletic events (hockey games are super fun) going on that are open to the public. If you like to go out a lot and party, you can totally do that. Greek life tends to facilitate that, and most of the fraternities are situated very close to campus, so you can go out whenever you want. There are also a few clubs in Collegetown. If you're interested in social outings, there are an infinite number of options for that, especially given that freshmen get a free bus pass. There are fun formal events at the Johnson Museum where everyone gets to dress up, and there's a restaurant/bar near campus that does salsa nights on Wednesdays that I've heard are awesome. We also have things like Slope Day, a giant music festival in the spring. I like the blend of technical and non-technical courses that I get to take in engineering as well. We're required to take 18 credits of liberal studies courses to graduate, which amounts to about six classes over five years. Most freshmen don't take liberal studies courses, so you end up taking one every semester from your third semester on. I came in with a lot of AP credit in the humanities, so I don't have to take all 18 credits (I came in with 12 of the 18 credits), but I'm planning on doing a creative writing minor and taking several French courses. Obviously, our curriculum focuses on the engineering courses, but it is also flexible enough to allow you to take classes outside of engineering . Speaking more generally, food was an important part of my college search, and Cornell has some of the best food I've had in general. I'd recommend the 14 meals/week plan to start, because you may eat breakfast and dinner on North campus as a freshman, and eat something smaller on central campus for lunch. There are a ton of options for food, so you'll never be bored with it (escpecially if you eat on west campus). Statler has the best food on campus IMO, and they have a student run restaurant that does fun themed dinners every week. The food there is amazing, and pretty cheap ($15-20 for an entree and appetizer/dessert).  The dorms are generally pretty nice. North campus has a lot more variance in quality, because the dorms have been build over the past few decades, but everyone I know was happy regardless of where they were. I lived in Dickson, the largest dorm on North, and I loved it. It is mostly singles, which was what I wanted, but it's really social. I made some of my closest friends through my hall. Court-Kay-Bauer and Mews are the nicest/newest, and have air conditioning. Donlon is the party dorm.  I'm going to stop here, but feel free to ask any questions if you have them. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  GERST 1170 (Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) has very easy assignments, but the material can be difficult at times. It depends on how much time you can invest in the class. If you give yourself enough time to do the reading before it's due, the class is very easy. The writing assignments are also somewhat report-like in that you don't need to have a very argumentative thesis. ENGL 1158 (American Voices/American Protest Literature) is also very easy. The work load is light, the grading is lenient, and it's fun if you have classmates that actually discuss the reading. ENGL 1167 (Great New Books) is awful.

            "commented_here  This is kind of funny since it screams \"freshman.\" As opposed to high school, college is more lenient on how and when you take certain classes. They have certain rules and requirements, but if you can figure out a way to do things differently while still abiding by all the rules, then no one will care. These rules usually consist of: - If you want to graduate, you need to satisfy XYZ requirements and take N number of credits (~120 or so credits). If your college doesn't have a residency requirements, which I believe CALS fortunately does not, you can even graduate in less than 4 years if you finish everything on time. This is pretty common for people coming in with AP credit. - You need to take at least 12 credits to be considered a \"full-time student.\" And you generally need special permission to \"overload,\" i.e. take more than 18 credits in a semester. - Certain classes have prerequisite requirements (i.e. you need to have taken a class beforehand in order to enroll in that class. Similarly, some may have co-requisites, (classes that need to be taken at the same time). For example, think of a lab section for a science class). - Each college and major have different policies for enrolling in classes. Some require that you speak with an advisor, who will approve a schedule for you before you are allowed to enroll, while others are more laissez-faire about it. - Some classes require you to get permission from a department head or professor in order to register. - *Some* programs will be pre-register their freshman automatically into core classes. If you are one of the 1% of students in which this poses a problem, you can move these classes around simply by speaking to an advisor. Face-to-face friendly interaction with an advisor, professor, department head, etc. can bend many rules. In short, if you can confirm that your FWS requirement has been satisfied completely, (which if you're not sure, contact a CALS adviser), then you are free to do whatever the hell you want. You can enroll in another class, you can leave it empty, etc.  Strategically, I would use this opportunity to either get a jumpstart on other requirements or to also take the first class required for a potential minor/double major etc.\n",

            "commented_here  [This]([url link] may be somewhat what you are looking for. I'm only really used to undergraduate housing, but I can tell you that closest living areas to the engineering quad are probably at the entrance to college town or the southern end of west campus. I think there are grad-specific options available in both places, and I am certain that grad students working as special RAs get to stay in undergraduate dorms. I like to think that a car is unnecessary, but I also am used to undergraduate life and love walking. If you live anywhere on campus or close to campus in college town, then everything on campus should be totally walkable; it takes me about 1/2 hour max to walk completely across campus. Further, there are buses that seem to be there just to serve Cornell, and they can cut down that travel time. Those same buses can also be used to go to the Ithaca mall and other such places. So I feel the transportation is pretty good (but I am not familiar with the Bay Area, so I can't compare).  A good amount can be done on campus; it has several gyms, a bowling alley, a movie theatre, nature trails, etc. But if you are going to live farther from campus, or want to explore other parts of Ithaca (the farmer's market, for instance) then you'll want to pay closer attention to when the transportation runs, carpool with friends, pay a taxi occasionally, or bring your own car.  Basically, I feel it is very walkable (and I love it that way), but it all depends on how far you want to explore and how much you are comfortable walking. It's kinda on the edge where having a having a car both seems overkill and creates an annoyance of parking, but it is almost necessary to travel to far stuff if you have your heart set on exploring. As for general advice, get used to calling 50 degrees nice weather. The first few weeks there this year were hot, but it turned freezing practically overnight and hasn't really let up since. It actually even snowed 3 days ago when spring break started. And Cornell doesn't have snow days. So be sure to have snow boots.  There is also ridiculously good food everywhere.  I could probably tell you something about engineering but I'm unsure what you are looking for and am only familiar with the undergraduate side of things.

Look for it in the PE section of the course catalog There are monthly contra dances, that don't require doing anything special with your feet. They are a good way to meet a lot of people. There is also a Ballroom dance club that teaches all the wedding-style couples dances. I'm pretty sure there is a graduate level ballroom dancing organization. You could check that out? Great tip! Thanks for the feedback. I'll be on the lookout for that course. [url link] <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  Here is the honest truth. The colleges can probably tell if you're not really passionate about the majors offered in their college when you complete your application materials; they've probably seen their fair share of people trying to sneak their way into Cornell through the internal transfer system. Also, if you've been taking zero related courses to any of the majors found in CALS (ie. biology, agriculture etc.) they'll know since they receive your transcript.  You're better off applying to both Arts and Sciences and Engineering and emphasizing that you really want to do their CS program. Hopefully your GPA is solid, your (I'm assuming freshman) courses are related to CS and you can demonstrate that you actually really want to do CS at Cornell (explain to the admissions office why Cornell specifically).

Total Payment = $94000 ($19000 in interest). Networth at age 32=0 --------------- **Case II: Attend GW and Graduate Debt Free** Assume savings set aside of $785 per month **Rosy scenario** - 0% inflation, 8% investment return, Employer matching  on 401k, 10 year investment period, Salary high enough to support savings goal Net worth at age 32=$287K  **Realistic Scenario** 4% inflation, 8% investment return, No Employer matching  on 401k, 10 year investment period, Salary high enough to support savings goal  Net worth at age 32=$115K ---------------------------------- Okay, math time is over. It looks like going to GW places you in a sounder financial position for goals you might want to accomplish in your thirties such as buying a house, getting married, starting a 529 fund for your kids, travel, retirement et cetera. Going to Cornell delays all of those goals by a decade and decreases the time you need to save to meet them. You essentially place your financial life on hold for a decade and lose the opportunity to build a sizeable nest egg. One could argue that time at Cornell is filled with intangible goodies that money cannot measure: stronger alumni networks. better education, deeper friendships, leadership opportunities, job leads, the ability to sing the Whiffenpoof song at reunions -- and all of this is true. However, it is not so true that you should put your life on hold for a decade afterwards. That decade could be better spent going to graduate school and going into debt at that point in your accademic life in exchanged for lifelong increased earning power. It could be better spent travelling unemcumbered by family constraints or job-hopping or starting a new company or just about anything than signing up for a decade of what amounts to indentured servitude. I know. I paid off my undergraduate loans after many painful years of decreased access to my income. Finally, those social intangibles are just as available to you at a school like GW which is well respected academically and better situated to jump start your professional network if work in a federal agency is your goal. Like one of the commenters stated: Those social intangibles don't come for free. You have to work at them by engaging in the social life of the school -- joining clubs, seeking leadership positions, taking on research projects with professors, exploring your passions in the city in which you live, developing close friendships with your classmantes -- all of which can be done at either GW or at Cornell. If you don't like doing that sort of thing, then Cornell isn't going to help you magically engage. I vote for graduating debt free from GW and going to Cornell as a grad student.\n",

To put this into perspective, most of the schools I applied to were liberal arts colleges with the exception of 2 universities - Cornell being one. I have never once felt lost here at Cornell; rather, I have come to appreciate such a large and diverse population. <eos> \n",

Thank you for the response Hey, i can relate.. i didn't do that great first year.  If it helps, my impression now is that while GPA is important, having a 4.0 isn't everything.. if you have fire rec letters / achievements that can really change the tide. Talking to a current PhD student who had a gpa lower than 3.5 really cheered me up, he was a great dude. I recommend talking to profs and students and getting involved in research ASAP.  my story : in HS i kinda just did the bare minimum to get things done and had a hard floor (get A's/A-'s or die), while in college, people were like.. \"Grades aren't everything\" \"Many people don't do that great freshman year\" \"The COE average gpa is 2.7\" which instilled in me a sense of complacency. I had given up before moving in. I thought CornellEngineering_TM was some impenetrable fortress and that I'd be in for a world of hurt as i compete with math wizards at these boogeyman weeder courses. And so i didn't apply myself. Skipped a ton of classes too cuz.. who's checking? Next semester I plan to be more proactive, with a manageable course load, but it'll take effort\n",

Additionally, membership allows them to track the comings and goings of people during the night in case anything happens/is damaged.

Some Lynda tutorials can also help, but I think the important things in 2300 are ultra important. All right, I'll look into it. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Cornell looks for motivated individuals who know what they want. Having said that, in reality, you have a while to decide the right path for you, once you get there. Before I start this post, let me just say I was in the same boat as you. I am a white teenager who went to a good high school in NJ.  I got a 139 on my PSAT sophomore year, and a 176 junior year. I am going to Cornell next year (accepted ED). But it's not like PSAT scores matter at all (because they don't). I'm just saying how low PSAT scores don't correlate to future scores too well. However, I did get a 1730 SAT, and a 31 ACT. I obviously submitted my ACT. On the SAT, I would go for a 2100+ to be on the safe side. I don't think Cornell looks at your SAT writing score, so I would focus heavily on math and CR. CR 50th percentile for the Cornell class of 2016 is a 690. Math 50th percentile is a 720. Assuming Cornell gets more competitive as the years go on, it would be good to get a 730+ in both of those subjects. However, I wouldn't cry over a 700 or 710. For the ACT, go for a 31 or 32+, depending on how competitive Cornell gets. Don't forget about your subject test scores. Aim for 700+ on them, especially engineering.  Ok, I'm done going on about SAT scores. I am going to guess that your GPA and test scores will be just fine. If this is the case, you have to realize you are just another smart kid applying to Cornell. Cornell will get hundreds of kids with the same GPA/test scores/class rank as you. You HAVE to make yourself different. So, you should do two things that helped me get in, even with a below average GPA and class rank: 1. Write good essays. Show a lot of passion for your major. Use DETAIL. Don't be general.  2. Participate in extracurriculars that pertain to your major. I find this to be very important, especially with Cornell.  I have a final plea: do not get attached to Cornell. Please. Or any school for that matter. Furthermore, it is only your sophomore year, it's a tad bit early to be worrying about this stuff. But more power to you if you choose to do so.  PM me if you have any more questions.\n",

            "commented_here  You need to know at a decent level for the LPS so hopefully you took 3 years of hs Spanish. Cornell spanish is quite a step up from hs spanish. It is every day with a large amount of work, but it is immersive. For the lps, I would review some grammar rules and conjugations. Ex. Pret vs imperfect, por vs para, and commands. Grammar is really the only thing that you can prepare for. Vocabulary and reading comprehension is something you gain along the way and are best not focused on directly. If I had to give one piece of advice for the lps it is DO IT HONESTLY don’t cheat and look up vocab or rules during. You can only take it once and if they place you in a higher level because of your higher score that is not reflective of your knowledge, it will not be very fun. With that said, if you don’t score at the 2000 level and below it, you have to take another semester. Span 1230 is a very good class for this case, look it up. It moves at a higher pace and once you move to the 2000 level, you will be prepared for Cornell languages and you will do very well in the 2000 class. So don’t beat yourself up if this happens. I was placed in 1230 from the lps and I enjoyed it as it was just right. I’m glad it happened. Also I would look at span 2070. It has a cool theme and it is useful if you’re going into healthcare, but some non premeds were in it too. My advice for profs is to get one that is a full blown prof rather than a grad student. The spanish department is very good here and profs give a lot of work but they also want to build your confidence so they’re very approachable and incredibly understanding. Highly highly recommend Diego Arias Fuentes if you can get him, one of the best profs in my life. I also had Alisa Linarejos Jimenez and I recommend her as well. I can’t comment on the others you listed. Just do your best on the lps and enjoy spanish. I was terrified of languages at Cornell but once I got the hang of it, they really were not that bad and spanish improved my education. You should have seen my speaking at the start of 1230😕, so if I can do it, you can too.\n",

Late spring/Summer/Early Fall has some amazing weather in my opinion though. 2. There are 2 career fairs, one in the fall semester, and one in the spring. At these career fairs, you'll have all these different companies come to Cornell with some recruiting reps where they give out information on open roles, answer questions, collect resumes, and be on the lookout for prospective hires. Once you submit your resume/speak with a representative, you may be contacted for an on campus interview, which can either lead to a further interview process or potentially a job. Since you're just starting college, chances are, you'll be on the hunt for summer internships. 3. Social life is what you make of it. I would say that living on North Campus is the prime opportunity to make friends, as it does have a very vibrant social scene. It can get hard to meet people as the year goes through since everyone will be bogged down by upcoming exams, problem sets, etc. For what it's worth, I think what made Cornell one of my best times in my life was the people I met and the friends I made (still some of my closest friends today, graduated 2 years ago). Ithaca pros: Close knit community - Going back to my claim about meeting wonderful people here, I think it's hard not to bond with your fellow classmates. You all will be going through some of the hardest work you've ever been through. You all know how rewarding the weekend will be after a strenuous week of studying and exams. There's a lot of different interest groups, which is awesome because you'll find people who have similar tastes as you. Diversity - I guess this is more of a Cornell thing, but nonethless, because Cornell has such a huge presence in Ithaca, there are lot of different people with different backgrounds here.  Beautiful geography - Whether it's Beebe Lake, Cornell plantations, or Cascadilla gorge, Ithaca truly is a beauty. How often can you say you walk by a waterfall everyday on your way to class? When it's autumn and the leaves color change, it is absolutely breathtaking. Even in the winter, despite the cold weather, you can't help but appreciate how aesthetically pleasing Ithaca looks covered in pure white snow. Ithaca is pretty rural and a lot of farmland, but it's also very naturey and you can't help but grow to love it.  Cons: Middle of nowhere - I personally didn't mind this, as it allowed me to stay focus and I also thought it let me bond with my friends a lot. I'm from the suburbs so I wasn't too spoiled but a lot of people I knew came from living in the city, so Ithaca could be very boring to them often. Weather - Already described above AEM - I was not an AEM major but had many friends who were. The most common opinion seems to be that the course load was not at all challenging. Most of my friends would end up working in finance (consulting, IBD, corporate fin, etc). Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions\n",

Having a grad student roomie sounds way more fun than a 19 yr old sophomore. They will probably wash dishes, keep reasonable hours, and won't barf all over things.

            "commented_here  stop worrying about it and just try your hardest. are you premed? First, this is called \"grading on a curve\", and where you fall on the curve determines whether your grade gets inflated (you get a higher score than what you would normally get) or deflated (you get a lower score than what you would normally get).  Grading on a curve is very common in science courses because without that curve, most people would be getting C's and D's. No joke. The average on prelims in many intro science courses is usually somewhere around 70 to 75 (sometimes reaching 80-ish) on a 100 point scale. Using a traditional grading method, that's a range of D to C+. So of course the professor will grade on a curve, so fifty percent of the class doesn't fail. Like if you see some of the orgo prelim grades and distributions, if it was traditional grading, then literally a good two-thirds of the class would fail. So this is seen as grade inflation (though not nearly as bad as schools like Harvard, where the lowest you can get is like a B); you're getting \"curved up\".  As a whole, grad schools don't really see this as a problem, since most other schools do this. On your transcript, they will see the median grade for the course, and can use that as a (very) rough standard. In addition, Cornell is fairly well-known for being really tough academically, and is known for its aggressive curving. So much so that I've been told (by admissions officers, no less), that a 3.0 from Cornell undergrad is weighed differently (higher) than a 3.0 from a top-tier public school or another top-tier private school. When I went to talk with my current graduate department's Vice Chair of Education about my chances of getting into the program (yes, I was that concerned), he said my 2.7 from Cornell (and I'm paraphrasing) wasn't something to worry about, and that it wasn't really a problem, so long as my GPA trend was upwards (it was) and my GRE scores were solid (they were).\n",

            "commented_here  The other answers here are correct that for some specific fields of CS multi can come in handy, but for the vast majority of CS majors, even those in COE who are required to take multi, you won't be needing multi under your belt. I asked this exact question to Prof White (intro to CS) and he explained it perfectly. To paraphrase him, calculus is the study of continuous, fluid data, but the data in CS is almost never continuous; instead it's disparate and chunky. Lin alg and discrete mathematics are far more important for understanding the type of data used in CS than calculus. So in short, at least according to Prof White, multi is \"useless\" to CS majors unless you're going into a field that explicitly requires it, and if you're going into one of those fields you would already (or at least should already) know by now. He even went so far as to say that calculus in general is \"pointless\" in CS. Don't be fooled, math is still paramount in being able to understand CS and you won't get anywhere without understanding lin alg and discrete mathematics, but calculus is one of the least important types of math to know for CS.\n",

You have to move your car once a day, and they’re pretty perceptive, but you can leave it there over weekends No, sorry. I can see how my wording was ambiguous. The parking law is only enforced on weekends. You have 24 hour parking on weekdays, on weekends there is no law and you can stay parked until monday night. <eos> \n",
            "commented_here  In introductory physics, you calculate trajectories or how fast things fall using equations. Of course in the real world you have air resistance and other factors which are ignored in the intro classes. The point of intro courses is to understand, in theory, how things \"should\" work so that you have an intuition and a vocabulary to explore and describe all the interesting ways that stuff actually works. I found intro to econ to have much more reasoning than, say, intro to biology or organic chemistry where it really is a lot of rote memorization. Just because the reasoning often (always?) winds up breaking down in the real world doesn't mean that demand curves, or buyers surpluses or competitive advantages aren't real things that can be reasoned about.\n",

Hey man! Im an econ minor who loves Behavioral stuff. First off, youre at the right place, one of the most notable behavioral economists is a professor here. So I can't exactly speak about the intro courses because I did accelerated my freshman year after doing AP Econ. If you feel confident in your math skills and applying them to economics, I would reccomend taking accelerated micro next semester. If you get a b+ or higher, it places you out of intermediate micro as well.  That being said I loved the behavioral economics course and I also love game theory (hoping to take it next semester). Its worth slogging through but it is a lot of statistics and math, more than I expected as a freshman. I don't like macro in general and its definitely easy to dodge after you've taken into and intermediate.\n",

This suite shares a bathroom, and is single sex, though the dorm is co-ed. Suite style dorms include the High Rises (HR5 and Jameson), the Low Rises (LR6, LR7, JAM, HILC, Ujamma), CKB, Mews, and the Townhouses.  Traditional style dorms consist of rooms along a hallway, with all members of that hallway sharing a bathroom. Generally, the hallways/sections are single sex. Traditional style dorms consist of Dickson, Donlon, and Balch (all-girls). The program houses are tailored to specific interests. You need to apply to each program houses explaining why you think you would fit into their atmosphere, and what you would contribute to that atmosphere.

            "commented_here  The main difference between the two colleges would be access to college-specific alumni networks. Arguably, CAS has the better network here, both in numbers and activity. CAS is also more likely to have alumni outside of New York, as CALS is one of the state colleges. That being said, these networks won't really help you get into medical school, though they may provide opportunities for things like shadowing and internships.  Medical schools are looking for a more balanced applicant, but going to CAS versus CALS doesn't mean you won't be any more well-rounded, as you can take courses across colleges, and CALS does have distribution requirements (though not as varied as CAS). As an out-of-state student, I would recommend applying to CAS, not CALS. You'd be paying the same in both schools, and CALS has a higher in-state acceptance rate than out-of-state, so admission rates are probably about the same.\n",

In that case, having 24 hour access will be nice so you don’t have to rush in before closing.  There are other ways to get 24 hour access as well.

Or you could even rush as a sophomore in the fall or spring. Being premed will *not* ruin your social life. I think it really depends on you. Some people will innately grasp material easier than others. For example, one of my pre-med friends took the notorious Math 2230-2240 sequence with me and a 6 credit language while being involved in various student organizations and did fine without too much trouble. I know another pre-med who struggled with Chemistry 2070/2080 a lot while rushing a frat, often citing it as a big time sink. Another one of my friends is capable of juggling 24+ credits with ease and I know people that think 18 is a struggle. Assess your learning abilities - obviously Cornell thinks you're capable, but how much time you'll spend on classes depends on how quickly you can understand class material. I've had people tell me that pre-med difficulty is overhyped and that pre-med is honest-to-goodness hard. Although, maybe you should consider taking some of the intro/weeder courses in pre-med your first semester and see how it goes.

There are courses where spots are reserved for people in the major, but if you talk with the professor, you can usually get into the course. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  Physics majors can go out and drink at least once a month, AEP majors stay home and drink every week. Actual, in-depth wall of text incoming  1. What are the major differences in terms of the required courses? Physics majors only need 2/3 courses completed in the intro sequence before affiliating. You’ll complete all 3 courses eventually, but since you need a major before sophomore year is over, this can be a favtor sometimes AEP majors need all 3 intro courses completed *and they need to be honors*. The honors track is significantly harder. Physics majors also take these honors courses (like myself), and its recommended to do so if you plan on going to grad school or pursuing academia. AEP also requires slightly higher grades before affiliating.  After affiliating: Physics majors have a shitton more options, and less restrictions. I’ll get into this in the next question. AEP and Physics split after Quantum (the fourth core class). AEP majors are usually forced into relatively similar schedules, but a Physics major will usually have a completely different schedule to another one.   2. What are the areas you can concentrate in for both the majors?  With a Physics Major, you need to fulfill a concentration. This means taking 15 credits in a different subject, 11 of which must be 3000+ courses. About half do an internal, Physics concentration, and half do an external. You can quite literally concentrate in anything you want, as long as its in CAS (so basically anything). AEP doesn’t have this level of freedom.  3. Will both give me an equally rigorous understanding of physics? Which is more focussed on mathematics? A physics major’s courseload can be just as rigorous as an AEP major’s, since most serious Physics majors will take a heap of AEP classes to supplement their skills (like MathPhys II, or StatMech). So I guess the answer would be... “maybe”? It depends on whether you want it to or not. So I guess the real answer is “if you want”.  I would say Physics would be more focussed on mathematics. This is a little hard to answer. AEP majors have a couple more math classes they are required to take, which are extremely advanced, but many Physics majors *will* take them anyways if they’re taking honors level classes after quantum. Also, many Physics majors will take a smattering of math classes if they wish, and those concentrating in math will probably have a more math-focussed schedule.   4. How do the additional requirements differ (which vary by college)? Is it advisable to take the engineering requirements if I wish to pursue a career in a technical field?  AEP majors can pretty much go into any technical field after they graduate. I know plenty in banking, consulting, teaching, research, and CS. Physics majors have slightly less options, and will probably need a class or two in their desired field. However, this is usually the case, since a physics major will have a concentration in a subject they find interesting enough to pursue a career in. Also, physics majors will have a broader range of coursework and options for minors or even a double major (like myself).  In the end, both majors will provide you with relatively similar chances of landing a job in a technical field. Which one will give you a better chance depends on your courseload and the field/firm you apply to.  You can find more information on the differences between CoE and CAS, but for a physics/aep major the biggest difference is CAS requires a foreign language, and CoE requires Chem 2090.  5. If I plan on double majoring in Physics and CS, is it better to pursue Engineering Physics with a CS concentration (if that's possible) instead? How much CS knowledge comes with a concentration?  Fuck me, I wish this had been on the top, I could have saved a lot of time had I known you were interested in CS.  If you’re planning on double majoring, don’t do AEP and CS at the same time lmao. AEP is way too strict and way too time-consuming. Physics and CS will result in a lot of pain and suffering on its own, trust me.  Physics concentration requires 15 credits, 11 of which must be 3000+. There is a caveat to this; you can’t use classes that are counting towards another major’s requirements. So you have three options here: 1: Stick with a concentration This is the easiest option. You can count 2110/1110/2800 as your non-3000+ 4 credits, and then take three 3000+ classes. This will probably be 3110, 3410, and some other elective. This gives you a good foundation, and probably plenty of experience to work as an entry-level code monkey. You’ll gain the skills to do research-level programming and general understanding of computers and their internal software.  2: Pick up a CS minor The CS minor requires the following: - CS2110 - CS3110/3410 - 4 classes 3000+ or CS2800 This is like 1-2 more classes than the concentration. You’ll gain enough experience to pursue independent learning and might consider going all out and getting the major in your sophomore year or something. If you’re considering getting the minor, you might find a bunch of different courses you suddenly want to take after 3110 when you’re looking at your list of options for the 3000+ level electives just to get a bit more experience in shit like ML or AI.  3: Major in both because I hate myself The difference between this and the minor is substantially greater than the minor and its concentration. The CS major on its own is not too bad, but since none of your concentration classes will be able to count towards your major, you either have to take 4 extra CS classes for a total of 7 CS electives (which is a lot by the way) or you concentrate in something else, and end up taking 4+ more courses in a different subject anyway.  You’ll need to take all the courses in the minor and two more core classes: CS 4110, and CS4820, as well as 3 technical classes (these can just be physics classes), a stats class, and a practicum (just a project class, ranges from easy as shit to hellish nightmare). Its a doable schedule, but will require some credit scraping so you can avoid bullshit classes with AP and doubling up some of your CAS reqs with classes like Intro to Asian Religion.  6. As the engineering physics degree is relatively unrecognized, does that pose a problem with employers in any way? That’s not really true at all. Cornell’s engineering physics program is considered to be one of the hardest on the planet, usually cited as top 3/5, only surpassed by MIT/CalTech. Lots of employers know the meat grinder that is AEP and will simply assume you can take on most challenging environments and subjects.  7. Which is better for grad school (if there's a difference, that is)? After engineering physics is there a barrier to pursuing masters in a pure physics field?  Plenty of AEP students go into a masters program afterward, but it is more common for Physics majors. It would also be a bit of a waste of time, taking a bunch of classes that would be irrelevant for grad school. However, if you’re asking if doing AEP would hurt your chances of getting into a grad school, it probably wouldn’t make a difference. Your grades will probably be a bit worse than if you had done Physics, which grad schools will look at, but might consider.  Fucking hell I’m never doing this on mobile again.\n",

You’ll need to take all the courses in the minor and two more core classes: CS 4110, and CS4820, as well as 3 technical classes (these can just be physics classes), a stats class, and a practicum (just a project class, ranges from easy as shit to hellish nightmare). Its a doable schedule, but will require some credit scraping so you can avoid bullshit classes with AP and doubling up some of your CAS reqs with classes like Intro to Asian Religion.  6. As the engineering physics degree is relatively unrecognized, does that pose a problem with employers in any way? That’s not really true at all. Cornell’s engineering physics program is considered to be one of the hardest on the planet, usually cited as top 3/5, only surpassed by MIT/CalTech. Lots of employers know the meat grinder that is AEP and will simply assume you can take on most challenging environments and subjects.  7. Which is better for grad school (if there's a difference, that is)? After engineering physics is there a barrier to pursuing masters in a pure physics field?  Plenty of AEP students go into a masters program afterward, but it is more common for Physics majors. It would also be a bit of a waste of time, taking a bunch of classes that would be irrelevant for grad school. However, if you’re asking if doing AEP would hurt your chances of getting into a grad school, it probably wouldn’t make a difference. Your grades will probably be a bit worse than if you had done Physics, which grad schools will look at, but might consider.  Fucking hell I’m never doing this on mobile again. <eos> \n",

Almost all of the other seniors will be living there and pretty much everyone is 21 so you will be going to the bars and people's apartments rather than frat parties or dorm drinking. It's nice to have your own fridge and kind of grow up before you go off to the real world. As far as costs, I actually spent less money living in collegetown. I had a car and we did most of our food shopping at Wegman's. Still ate out once in a while and ordered campusfood which is where your prices spike. By just buying groceries, I would spend around $150 a month.  Trust me, you will want to live in collegetown as a senior.\n",

Just like any language, there's no way to immediately get into the advanced area (which includes business), so you will have to learn from scratch. This is because Japanese characters Kanji (which would be Hanja/Hanzi) have multiple pronunciations, labeled by Kunyomi and Onyomi.

Another problem is that it’s flooded with Athletes and legacies who aren’t interested in communications at all. This brings the reputation of the major down. Some advice - if you really want to be a journalist, I’d steer clear of Comm at Cornell. There are tons of people who want to be journalists and nearly all of them will be rejected. Comm at Cornell will not make you stand out amongst the crowd - it simply is not rigorous enough. Someone double majoring in Economics and Government has a much better chance. Econ at Cornell is generally rigorous and technical and actually prepares you for a job. Another poster mentioned this but the Comm major is essentially a collection of people who don’t really care about it and choose it as a major because it’s a complete joke.  With that said, there are definitely some people I know who legitimately enjoy Comm. It’s probably one of the easiest paths to a 4.0 other than maybe AEM, so if you’re going to do it make sure you stand above all the other people doing it for the lolz. Many people I personally know have a 4.0 or are very close to it in Comm. Most medians are A or A-, so you pretty much can get a 3.5+ so long as you show up. You may or may not have realized this, but you get essentially nothing out of things that are super easy for you. Challenging yourself is how you improve.  I’ll always have respect for people who do things because they like them - but most people in Comm do not. Many are there because they couldn’t handle the academic rigors of other majors, probably due to the fact that they shouldn’t have been admitted in the first place *cough* legacies *cough* athletes. This is part of the reason why Comm gets such a bad rep. Many of the classes are actually great, it’s just that most of the people don’t give a fuck and they become useless.  In general, my advice for everyone is to do what you like doing. If that is Comm, then kudos to you - but recognize the perceptions that will be consciously and unconsciously applied to you throughout life. There’s all sorts of research into unconscious bias and the fact of the matter is that if you major in something that has the reputation that Comm has, it will reflect negatively upon you whether the person making the judgement knows it or not. I’d love to see employment statistics for Comm majors, but the only thing I could find was a mean salary for people going into Comm and media of $47k. That is NOTHING for a 200k education. You may as well have become a mechanic or a truck driver. I’ve always found though that people who really like what they’re doing end up successful regardless, so keep that in mind.  In summary, what did you expect to hear in posting this? If you really want to do it, everything I’ve just told you shouldn’t have swayed you at all. If you’re having doubts, I’d think very hard about this choice. Make sure you do something you like - if you don’t you’ll be miserable forever.\n",

I was an Econ major in CAS and explored some courses in physical/biological sciences, engineering, and elsewhere. My experience was extremely collaborative. Students are always looking for help and, in turn, willing to help when they're able to. Really the best way to tackle Cornell is with study friends, and everyone realizes that. If you have a group of students as a support network taking similar courses or offering help, it really will be a lot easier to succeed.  As for the workload, it's definitely manageable, despite what you may have heard about Cornell. You'll make time for other endeavors, and the social sciences aren't known to be the most demanding workloads at Cornell. You'll have some weeks with multiple exams, papers, projects, and assignments due, but if you keep a balanced and consistent study life and don't fall behind you'll be able to handle it just fine. I knew people from all majors, from hotel/ILR (generally considered to be lighter workloads) to MechE, computer science, or pre-med majors who did well in school, got accepted to grad schools/good careers, had thriving social lives, joined clubs, had campus jobs, etc. It really is possible to have a balanced, happy life here. That said, it's not easy. It will most likely be an adjustment from your high school life. But in my experience, as the time goes on, you accumulate more work over the years, but you get a LOT better at handling it. Junior and Senior years I had much harder courses but somehow had more free time just because I was a better/stronger student and much more efficient at studying. Anyway, good luck deciding and if you have other questions definitely ask! Cornell was incredible and I hope it makes a good impression on you.\n",

            "commented_here  Someone else may correct me on this because I'm not as familiar with the Cayuga Heights region, but it looks like the [31 bus]([url link] is the regular bus that goes closest to that place. The next closest regular bus would be the [32 bus]([url link] but you'd have to walk all the way to Uptown and Warren to get that. There are a couple other buses that run somewhat nearby, but very infrequently (37, 41, and the 72 on weekends). This is all according to the TCAT System Map, where I toggled each route on and off to see if it went near that location. I expect that busing from this place will be annoying because the 31 bus only comes every hour or so, and not at night, and not on weekends. And it's not a walkable distance, or at least, I wouldn't want to walk all that way through dark wooded areas.  There are some more reclusive grad students who prize quiet remoteness over everything else, and don't really socialize with other grad students, who might benefit from such a location. And perhaps if you're like married or something and want to settle down with your SO in a remote place for six years, maybe it's not so bad (as long as your SO can help with transportation). But I would probably recommend strongly against this place. Its location is almost certainly why it's still on the market in June. Perhaps you'll end up finding out that your work (and play) schedule don't require a bus at night or weekends, although if you're a grad student this would probably be rare (especially for work). But I'd rather play it safe and pay a bit more for a location that gives me much better transportation options my first year, and then consider such a place my second year after I've gotten to know Ithaca and my lifestyle in Ithaca.

            "commented_here  My background: I took a nontraditional route to becoming a software engineer at a mid-size software company.  Moreover, I was never interested in being a software developer to begin with - instead, I am way more interested in management. It's super-tough to major in something you're not interested in and aren't having fun doing - whether that lack of interest/fun was there in the first place, or developed over time as you found it to be difficult. (Sometimes lack of interest and difficulty go hand-in-hand, like a positive feedback loop. Conversely, sometimes interest and ease of learning go hand-in-hand, in the same way.) Either way, if you're not interested in it anymore, trying to stick with it might be painful. After all, you might stick with it for the next 2.5 years, but after that, are you going to force yourself into a software engineer job you hate? Without a degree that you might need in something that you'd rather do? If you're interested in becoming a business analyst/project manager who works on teams with engineers, that can be a pretty awesome path. If your parents say that you'll never starve as a software engineer, logically you'll never starve as the manager of software engineers. A great project manager is worth their weight in gold. My team's PM certainly is. I feel like we'd be fucked without him. I think a PM is especially useful for (in no particular order) * organizing all the things, * being the tactful, cool-headed, super-respectful-but-assertive face of our team to other arms of the business, * coordinating with other arms of the business (who have an infinite number of demands for a team with a finite number of developer-hours), and doing some analysis on the business data with both business and engineering needs in mind, * prioritizing the work that we will do, and helping set timelines, * providing input to developers on business logic and decisions, * receiving input from developers on technical feasability/constraints, estimates of how long certain business decisions will take to implement, and even ideas/scenarios that the business side hadn't considered, * relaying developer information/questions back to the stakeholders, * etc. At my company, the project manager position isn't necessarily \"above\" the engineers in any way - the teams tend to be led by a lead software engineer - but they're placed directly on the team. Some of the PMs have a CS or other technical background, but most do not. My team's PM in particular has a business degree. Of course, every company does things differently, but every software engineering team is going to need some kind of project management position that understands and talks to the business side. Now, all this being said, I know it's hard to stand up to your parents about your choice of major/career - especially if they're in charge of paying for the education. I know from firsthand experience. My parents wanted me to be some sort of engineer, but I wanted to do physics instead. I rebelled and forced the issue, and there was a lot of drama, but after a couple years we were okay again. (Yes, I know, the fact that I'm a software engineer now, and enjoying it, is ironic. Shut up.) But it's your life and you need to be able to take charge of what you do with it. You'll have to evaluate on your own whether you can convince your parents that as long as we have software engineers, we'll need project managers. Or force the issue.\n",

            "commented_here  Here's a couple of suggestions for making money around Ithaca. I wasn't an engineering student, but I always wanted to chip away at my tuition while I could. -Library jobs. Easiest jobs ever, and you can study while sitting at the desk. It's even better if you work in Mann or one of the other less populated libraries, as opposed to Uris or Olin. -Psych/Econ experiments. Being a lab rat pays well (I averaged $20/hr.) as long as you sign up for experiments that offer compensation. The best are game theory Econ experiments, because if you play intelligently, you take home a ton of cash. -Buying/Reselling textbooks. It's kind of a seasonal thing, but if you offer more cash than the bookstore or Kraftee's, you can buy off all your friends and acquaintances, and then re-sell on Amazon for a profit. -Independent study. I assume you can take non-engineering credits. If you do this, you can write one ten-page paper for an entire semester and get 2 credits. This frees up a ton of time for other studying, a part-time job, etc. -Keg parties. If you have a house with a few other people at some point, get a keg, and publicize all over facebook. Girls get in free, guys are $5, and just hide all your valuables. Then, in addition to the keg inside, sell shots/mixed drinks for a big markup at the bar. Protip: freshmen by-and-large don't know the difference between a vodka-cran with Grey Goose, and one with Barton's. Especially when you pour Barton's into an empty Grey Goose bottle. -Finally, if all else fails, buy weed from hippies on the commons and re-sell it, marked up considerably, to dumb rich kids. Most can never tell the difference between schwag and headies.\n",

There's also different professors for the classes so I'm not sure how much my experience will transfer over to you but I'll give some personal experience: I took 3040 in 2017 Spring and 3030 in 2017 fall. 3040: My professor was Fei Fei Wang who, looking at the course roster, won't be doing it this fall but the class wasn't all that difficult. Depends on your comfort with economics but I put in a relatively average amount of work and got an A. Professor was pretty good as far as helping with questions when I asked. Don't remember the problem sets being that bad. Tests were taken in class (1hr 15 min) But again the professor I had doesn't normally teach it so I'm not sure how it would be otherwise 3030 was last semester and I had Troshkin who, afaik, is one of the two that always teaches it (other on being Besharov). I've heard to take Besharov if you're majoring in ECON (because it's harder but you learn more) and Troshkin otherwise. Some things about Troshkin's class: lectures are not very good. They're pretty boring and dry, mostly consist of him just putting slides up with math or graphs on them and flipping through them. Doesn't really explain the math you're doing (like Lagrange multipliers) but the math isn't that difficult so it's definitely manageable. He's pretty good / open in OH though. Book is pretty good to consult for additional info. I had a TA who is also the TA this semester and she was pretty good, usually understanding with handing in HW and helping with the HW in OH. Tests were iffy. First one I think the average was actually high 60s-mid 70s maybe? Second prelim the mean was much higher, somewhere in the 80's (might've been high 80's honestly, don't remember) Final was actually relatively difficult but I still did fine in the course (I think A-?) for putting in pretty modest effort (note that by modest, I still did every problem set and would practice problems about 1-2 days before each prelim and about 4-5 days before the final).  For 3030, he said the tests would be almost exactly like the HW which was true for the second one (reason for the high mean) but not so true for the first one (probably reason for the lower mean, everyone was expecting a more HW aligned test). All in all, if you do the problem sets and pretty much just keep practicing them prior to exams you should be alright. I'd say the PSets take around 2-3 hours each maybe (if I remember right). Except the first one which was like 20-30 minutes my semester hahaha. But yeah, if you're comfortable with economic intuition and some light math (see: algebra and basic calc) + not really learning from lecture you'll probably be fine. If you're the type that can learn from a textbook you'll be even better (granted you take the time to read it). Other than that you just have to learn from doing the problem sets and following along in discussion (they go over pset answers there). Also just ask questions I think that's the number one way I learned things I was iffy on in class. Sometimes economics seems like black magic voodoo fake science when you're trying to wrap your head around why the people trade to this equilibrium instead of that one and asking the TA questions usually clears up the ambiguity pretty quick. Unfortunately can't compare it to the intro econs (except to say that I think you do online HW/pre class Quizzes for those? That was NOT used at all when I took these courses). Also have no info regarding if the Dyson minor is worth it, sorry! If you have any specific questions feel free to ask I'll do the best I can to answer! EDIT: realized I wrote a shit ton sorry for the huge amount. Wanted to add that in 3030 they graded every problem on the PSets and usually somewhat strictly with the intuition that they grade harsh on the psets and then the tests are easier cause they copy from the HW's. Again, if you don't know something on the psets just go to OH and you'll pretty much get the answer so the \"harsh\" grading isn't that big of a deal. Some people I'd see that likely didn't go to OH and just scrapped together the psets quickly would get like 70's on them but I think my lowest was like 88, the rest were around 95-100 so really not that bad.\n",

There's also different professors for the classes so I'm not sure how much my experience will transfer over to you but I'll give some personal experience: I took 3040 in 2017 Spring and 3030 in 2017 fall. 3040: My professor was Fei Fei Wang who, looking at the course roster, won't be doing it this fall but the class wasn't all that difficult. Depends on your comfort with economics but I put in a relatively average amount of work and got an A. Professor was pretty good as far as helping with questions when I asked. Don't remember the problem sets being that bad.

I hate to be a fearmonger, but I do not have much faith in the system. Your friend has some unfortunately legitimate concerns. Had a good friend go through this. They took a leave of absence, then returned. The system essentially failed them. The university's response was pretty fucking appalling, and while I'm sure Gannett has well-trained and well-meaning staff, Cornell is seriously all about covering themselves from liability, not to mention breaching the hell out of HIPAA laws.  (They informed a room full of people of my friend's situation, full details, then proceeded to sit us down and go through the warning signs of suicide and depression. Only a handful of those people even knew my friend, and it was such an embarrassing and illegal invasion of privacy that I ended up leaving. I should have been more vocal, but this was a few years ago and I was incredibly pissed.) As far as I am aware, if your friend exhibits symptoms that the therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist is afraid she will harm herself (or others), she can be forcibly hospitalized for up to 72 hours. I am talking clear intent, plan, and means, not just thoughts of suicide. If one ends up in this scenario (or in the hospital after actually attempting self harm), the university is sending that individual straight to leave of absence, I am pretty damn sure.  The hospitalization will show up in background checks that include mental health (sounds obvious, but) and would stop a person from doing stuff like buying a gun in some states or getting particular security clearance in the government. A normal employer wouldn't have access to that info though. Now my friend had to take a semester off and, as a stipulation for readmission, had to see a psychologist during that semester and get their approval as well as speak with a Cornell official and get signed off there as well. My friend passed with flying colors, and has since graduated, but I wouldn't say that they are a happy, or particularly well adjusted, person. They were, however, very good at \"seeming\" okay, and that was enough for whatever therapist Cornell assigned them for the duration of their schooling. The whole ordeal has left my friend with absolutely no trust of mental health professionals and a very deep anxiety of being sent away if they tell anyone their problems. They are doing a bit better now after having graduated, but it honestly blows. That being said, perhaps others have had better experiences. I am very wary (even distrustful) of the university as a bureaucratic entity, but the situation I described above is an extreme one. I guess I personally still believe in the mental healthcare system, but just - be careful, I suppose? Your friend needs to find a doctor that they truly trust - that may or may not be the ones at Gannett. I am glad that you are supporting your friend and helping her with this research. Do keep in mind that this is what I know secondhand, so some of my info may be a little skewed, but I want to warn of the bullshit that could (not necessarily will!) happen, especially since I don't know her situation.

If you contact the prof now, he or she will probably tell you to wait until next semester to see if a spot opens up in the class anyway. But in general, it doesn't hurt to send a short email to the professor explaining your situation. Prof. XYZ, I'm a junior in ILR trying to fulfill ABC requirement for the major. I was unable to pre-enroll in ECON 0000. I am very interested in subject AAA and I would love to take this class to fulfill my requirement. Is there any way I can enroll in this course? If not, could I be put on a waitlist? Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, [NAME] The email could be a lot better but you get the idea. Try to sound engaged/interested but not desperate. Make sure you emphasize that it's for a major requirement. It's also a good idea to show up to the first few lectures and tell the prof about your concerns. Hopefully he or she is approachable. <eos> \n",

But the atmosphere is great; its a tight-knit community and you will meet neat people. Program house is an ok place to start. Note that signing up to possibly go into one does not guarantee you a spot. The facilities are no better or worse than the other dorms that you would be equally likely to get into. The people tend to be nice. The primary differences are that it is not just freshmen in the dorm, and that most people (especially non-freshman) who live there are really into music- all sorts. They put on a \"coffeehouse\" performance every month or so. It is not overwhelmingly male by any means, while I don't have the stats I think it's close to 50-50. The house does have some practice rooms and pianos that are not present/nicer than other dorms. The residents vary from rappers, electronic mixers, classical pianists, rock bands, singers, symphonic band players, some music majors, but all love music. The only complaint I've heard is that occasionally it can be noisy when people are practicing instruments at all hours and you want to study, but there are always ways to remedy that. Source: gf lived in JAM freshman year, did not after that because not everyone wants to live on North campus with all the freshman forever, even if it is in JAM\n",

            "commented_here  There's too many other factors at play in your grad school application. GPA/transcript matters some, but so do your GRE and Physics GRE scores, and your undergrad research experience. If you have some sort of academic advisor in the physics department, or a physics professor you like, you could ask them for their take on this - they'll undoubtedly have more accurate info than I do, since they've probably actually been on admissions committees. I want to be admitted to a top ten program Keep in mind that rankings don't really matter for PhD programs. After 3-ish years, you'll probably figure out what subfield of physics (theoretical particle, experimental particle, theoretical condensed matter, experimental condensed matter, astrophysics, biophysics, accelerator physics, etc.) you've gravitated towards (pun intended) and want to get your PhD in. Then you'll have to look at the exact list of professors doing that research at each university, and see where has the highly-respected researchers doing the stuff you think is coolest. There are tons of non-Ivy universities, including many large state schools, that have specialties in specific subfields and niche research topics.

            "commented_here  So club fairs are pretty mad and crazy. Clubfest is massive. Picture thousands of people and hundreds of booths packed tightly with people trying to have conversations at all of them. Lots of clubs can be very aggressive and hand out lots of paperwork and chocolate. Some put on pretty distracting displays as well. Application processes and selectivity vary a lot from club to club. Some highly selective ones have multiple rounds of interviews and apps that are draining. There are some with huge initiation processes that are probably worse than remaining fraternities. Those mostly apply to the better consulting clubs and the a capella groups though. There are plenty of small tightly knit clubs that just want enthusiastic people and are open to anyone who shows up semi-regularly. There are even some where you can show up on the right day and become part of the executive board without knowing more than a few people. All that being said, go to club fest. You'll find a club that wants you if you look around. You can always start one with a few friends I'd you don't find what you're looking for.\n",

Read up about their research groups and the kind of things they do and see what intrigues you. Don't be afraid to ask questions about what their work is in and how they do things. In your email, maybe describe your background and what you like and ask if you could come in to talk to the professor some time about doing research. Most professors are more than welcome to help undergraduates out with this (unless they have a particularly full plate that semester) and will be very accommodating. Undergrad (unlike grad school) is definitely where a little more hand-holding is there in the research progress, which is awesome! Ask the professor for advice on what papers to read and how to get started with research (or even what research IS and how that professor's research group operates on a day-to-day scale!). TL;DR: Email, explain interest, don't be afraid to ask questions! It's okay to not know -- professors at Cornell take kindly towards undergrads in my experience. Better to have these issues now, because in grad school they don't hold your hand and you have to read and develop interest and find out how things work all on your own. :)\n",

            "commented_here  Hello! I’m currently an upper year ag sci student as well! West Campus housing and the Collegetown residence halls are great. For college town residence halls, try for Cascadilla and Sheldon, I’d stay away from Schulyler only because it’s pretty far away from campus. All of them have a good number of upper level transfers in them. I have several friends in co-ops and they love it. Some are harder to get into than others, all have their own selection process. Some of them select house members on a pure lottery system while others will pick who they think is the best fit for the house. I think that there is a gender disparity though, it’s easier for guys to get in because there are generally less of them that want to live in the co-ops and the co-ops are often shooting for a 50/50 ratio. Do some research and contact the houses that interest you, though! There’s a Facebook page for cooperative housing at Cornell.  There are tons of cool outdoorsy and agriculture related clubs on campus. Research Hortus Forum (a plant club that does some really cool stuff), COE classes, outing club, ECO, and nature clubs. All are pretty active and have chill members. Dilmun is winding down for the season, but once it gets warmer they have weekly work parties that are fun, and you bring home veggies when they have them.  For agricultural science specifically, there’s a group of “agricultural ambassadors” that act as peer mentors for the major. They are trained to answer any questions you have about the major or life at Cornell in general. They run the major orientation events that happen throughout the fall semester, too. They have an email address if you want to get in touch. Let me know if you have any more specific questions and I’d be happy to help you out! Cornell is great, you’re gonna love it.\n",

There have been lots of \"Ask a Dean CGSU Edition\" e-mails the last month or so (CGSU - Cornell Graduate Student Union). The GPSA and grad school have been making various announcements since last year when the CGSU was organized. Also, if you're part of the collective bargaining unit, you should have been receiving info on where to vote. Students on external funding are not part of the unit and don't get to vote though, and they also won't get the \"you're eligible to vote\" e-mails. If you're an eligible voter, then I suggest you develop an opinion fast and go out to vote. Here's the [CGSU website]([url link] Here's the [Cornell Ask a Dean series]([url link] The last section are all the union sections directed to the grad school. As for me, I can't say I'm impartial on this matter. I'm all for a union, but the way CGSU conducts itself seems predatory, petty, and unprofessional. They haven't said anything concrete really and just offer platitudes like \"more pay, better insurance, workers comp\" and things that we all obviously want, but they don't have a strategy beyond \"we'll get it at the negotiations\". They strike me more as zealous supporters rather than mature individuals seeking civil discussion and better conditions with a clear strategy. Ironically, I see some parallels between their campaign and Trump's... I want a union with a professional face and clear direction. I think there are many students at Cornell that would benefit from a union, but I don't think CGSU is that union. Here's an [interview with Professor Dave Collum]([url link] regarding his stance on the union. He's anti-union and I agree with his reasoning as to why CGSU is a bad fit. Disclaimer: He's a bit of a tactless jerk. Anecdotally, this was my first impression of the the CGSU. The CGSU came to GPSA last year to have a \"discussion\" with the graduate school (I was a field rep at the time). Approximately 40 extra students came to support the CGSU. The students asked questions of CGSU and Barbara Knuth (the graduate school dean) and it was not a very civil discussion. The CGSU peanut gallery cheered whenever CGSU reps spoke and boo'd whenever Barbara spoke. The CGSU would say things like \"We have unmet needs X, Y, and Z\" followed by cheering, to which Barbara would resond \"We already have tools A, B, C in place to meet needs X, Y, and Z respectively\" followed by boo'ing. It was a disgusting civil display and an awful first impression. Since then, the CGSU has done nothing to improve their image in my eyes.\n",

The biggest thing for me in comparing Cornell to other schools (I like to use MIT as an example since I'm a CS major) is the breadth of interest. At any top-tier university you'll meet plenty of fascinating intelligent people, but Cornell gives you a chance to meet people who are just as smart as you are but see the world completely differently. I'm and engineer but I have friends in plenty of different fields, and I occasionally take classes way, *way* outside my area. I find those often lead to the best conversations.

            "commented_here  The campus *is* breathtakingly beautiful. Make sure to look at a few pictures with snow on them. And google \"Cornell Sesquicentennial\" -- we are getting all sentimental about it this year. I had a two great advisors. Both of them cared about me tremendously as a person first, a scholar second and as a colleague third.  I got along with one of them, so he became my PhD advisor. Ithaca is a very small town; eight years is a long time. What happens in many fields is that the only folks in town that are super steeped in the area you care about enough to get a PhD in are your research group mates and your advisor. Sure, you have other friends -- but they are merely polite about the thing that floats your boat. So, one ends up hanging out quite a bit with one's advisor.  In my case, we went sailing together, had dinner with his wife and kids, went to church together, travelled to conferences together -- it was a great friendship and has formed the bedrock of my career. My advisor was among the first people I called when my actual dad died. I remember one ~~hilarious~~ geeky evening where we had been drinking wine and decided to tell our advisor's seven year old son a math-based bedtime story of evil null-spaces, sneaky pivot tables and the brave little singularity that could. It made no sense, but we did it as a research team and cracked each other up -- until we realized that our advisor's seven year old son was following the math talk just fine. And, it was like that for all of my research group mates. It wasn't just my advisor though -- I had other professors that I met at church or where-ever, who still send me Christmas cards and invite me to visit them whenever they are within a thousand miles of me. I was given tremendous freedom as a student -- I confessed I loved music and Broadway musicals. My advisor recommended that I take a few classes in Music Composition theory and a summer off to work in New Jersey and see Broadway shows every single Thursday evening. He insisted that we take time to enjoy the beauty of the campus and the Ithaca surroundings and each other.  It was the best eight years of my life. Here in Westside-istan, far away from Cayuga's waters, there is a crowd of Cornell alumn 800 strong. We get together for alumni events. We sing the Alma Mater and the Drinking Songs. We know the words. We know the harmonies. We sing it as if we mean it.  And, we do.\n",

            "commented_here  So as I'm writing this I'm currently implementing a k-nearest neighbor classifier for my ubiquitous computing class. Pretentiousness (and procrastination) aside, if you didn't understand any of that, you'll actually learn what that all means through the major. The professors here are doing amazing stuff in the field and it's honestly a real treat to take classes from them (and work in their labs!). The major is different now, and I think my class is the last remnant of the old major, and honestly you can do a LOT of things with the major, which also raises some slight issues in answering the now-tiring question of \"what does your major do?\" It's a bit different depending on how you want to go about your tracks and everyone wants to do something different with the major. Personally, I'd like to go into EdTech or something education related so I'm very much into developing and human-computer interaction (repping the university wide education minor here), other students want to go into UX or front-end developing so they take classes like rapid-prototyping or the other design related classes (human-computer interaction is a pretty standard class here as well). Database design is also another aspect you could get into, with back-end programming classes available for those types. Another track involves investigating the sociological/psychological side of technology, so think networking, social interaction through computers. But the things I mentioned above barely even scratch the surface of everything you can do with information science. You can absolutely go super cs heavy, or you can go almost completely opposite on the spectrum and focus on the people using technology. The main thing that differentiates information science from computer science is the human-oriented perspective being a critical part of the major. This also means that both technical and researched-based writing is more integral to the major compared to cs. So the fact that you're looking to do pre-med through InfoSci is 100% doable. (Health and Computation with Tanzeem Choudhury, a leading expert in the field of ubiquitous computing, would be a good class to take eventually, and also would be a good professor to talk with, but she's on sabbatical this year) Of course, I'm biased because I'm in the major, but I love the freedom you get, and the major is definitely becoming more well known on campus.\n",

Rush business fraternities and try to join the finance clubs on campus.  2. If admitted I would be added to the networking opportunities, stock pitch competitions, meet people at banks that way, etc... It is not enough to go to the career fairs and get a card. You must do all the phony networking things put forth by these clubs. 3. Keep in contact with all the people you meet along the way. Make connections and keep in touch. This stuff about networking is all taught by the finance clubs and business fraternities on campus. This is really the only way to get a job at these places. To really know someone. So if you want to make the next 2 and a half years about being an obsequies snowflake and bowing down to everyone you meet in order land a job on the street than go ahead. If you are that hungry, go ahead. But in my mind, I would never want to act like a fake phony not real professionalized dick who talks about bullshit financial products and makes bullshit connections with corporate people just to get a job doing something that you still won't really understand when working there. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  Which college have you been accepted to? Although Cornell is an ivy league, it has separate colleges within the university and some of those ARE public. The more prestigious ones are the private colleges like engineering, hotel administration, arts and sciences.

Many students cannot hack the Cornell work ethic after freshman year and transfer out, so they need to fill those gaps.

You will get a good mix of smart, hard-working kids as well as the rich snobs who really don't belong there. For the most part, Cornell values what you are doing now and what you have accomplished. So what if someone was a high school dropout, but has proven they are capable of cracking down and been successful in their college experience?  It really boils down to why you actually want to go to Cornell. Do you just want to go there to put a popular name on your resume or do you want to gain valuable skills that Cornell can teach better than the others?

I'm not a transfer, so I can't really comment on that aspect, but in general I feel like I should be frank and say that whether or not you go to a school should be dependent on how much you like that school. That can factor in a lot of things, and I accept that different people have different priorities in choosing a school. However, you seem to be focusing a lot on image. This is something I don't quite understand. So you feel like Cornell is not as \"prestigious\" or \"elite\" as you initially believed. Why is this important to you? Does it effect the quality of education you will receive? Really, it's all about priorities. Its your job to sort yours out and make a decision. I applied to Cornell ED because I really like it as a school and thought I would do well here, not because of acceptance rates or Ivy status. What *you* consider most important is up to you.\n",

The class was not overly difficult and just required keeping up with problem sets, studying regularly, and going to the teacher/TA/study center if you needed help.

            "comment_utter <bos> Have you ever taken a CS-related class or done anything like it? I feel like many people are attracted to CS/IS because it looks 'sexy' (think of the show Silicon Valley) from the outside - but they end up disliking it once they get into the grit of it.  I would absolutely make sure you like this stuff before subjecting yourself to it. cs 1110 is easy and tolerable, but 2110, although not difficult, will be unbearable if you dislike the content.  What should I take in the fall? math 1120, cs 1110, cs 1300 (super easy, intro web dev for babbies), stats (CALS IS req), and IS 1200 (as per [these reqs]([url link] - if you can.  This seems like a lot but 1300 and 1200 are basically meme classes. I really feel like I screwed up because I was insecure and unsure about my future for my first year of college. You're good.  IS requirements aren't extensive in CALS. Someone could finish in 3 years with a competitive gpa if they really wanted to.

Not quite sure what the other posts are talking about. I can't personally speak to CS 1110/2110 but a Windows laptop should definitely work as they are in Python and Java, respectively. I took CS 3110/3410/4410 with only the occasional minor inconvenience. Specifically, CS 3110 requires a virtual machine if you are on Windows - but get used to it because you should use a VM for CS 3410 (regardless of OS) as well. A significant portion of assignments are done on Cornell servers over SSH, so in any case you'll definitely want to become familiar with linux/terminal commands. My only caveat is to get enough RAM to run the VMs and definitely get enough RAM if you plan to do graphics/rendering/machine learning work. 16GB should be more than enough for most tasks unless you are doing some truly lit neural nets or something.\n",

I was about to say, this is definitely NES 3519, there is a person that matches this description exactly in that class. How big is this class? Most likely you aren't the only person feeling this way. It's a super difficult situation, especially cuz you dont wanna seem like the bad guy. Maybe if you felt comfortablw enough, you could talk to either the TA or the professor about your feelings. But you definitely have to do it in a tasteful way. I think your feelings also matter if you think you are being impeded and robbed of learning time. You could try speaking with the other student before or after the next lecture. Try not to be confrontational (so they don’t get defensive) and see what happens. If there is no change in behavior and other students feel like you do, then consider escalating the issue and speak with the professor. YAAAS CALL THAT BITCH OUT I'm glad I'm not the only one. Every time he's late for class I'm just hoping he doesn't show up YES Not in that class but this is beyond annoying and disrespectful. In one of my CS classes there are ppl who watch game streaming or Olympic video and a group of people who always chat in every lecture. Those are kinda distracting but this one is just outrageous. <eos> \n",

Are you familiar with DC? I live here now if you happen to have any questions about it. Dupont Circle is indeed a fun place. <eos> \n",

LSE only requires a 3.3 (this is because they're significantly more \"international\" and thus has A LOT more open spots for students who want to study abroad, as opposed to Oxford/Cambridge that is less open to American students) Side note: LSE is significantly more fun because its in central London where all the nightlife is located :) <eos> \n",

I'm debating between doing business (finance) and chemical/biomedical engineering, leaning more towards business. However, I've gone to an engineering magnet school where I take engineering courses every year and have attended engineering summer programs (Cornell CATALYST and one at a local university). My grades are sub-par, GPA is a 92.3 (3.6), SAT is 1330, SAT subject math 2 and physics are both 630 (pretty bad, I know), and my ACT is a 32, so I know my grades definitely don't scream engineering ready. I want to go into business but I'm afraid that I don't have any programs or initiative to show for it. The initiative is there for engineering but my grades aren't. I'd be happy getting into either and can always transfer, but I'd like to know which gives me the better chance of getting into Cornell. Thanks.

I think the sooner you start on meeting new people, the better, as it will give you more time to find new friends and flesh out relationships with them. I was advised to take a relatively light courseload my first semester back, and it was definitely my best semester academically (I've heard that a lot of people feel that their returning semester is their best). If you're worried about credits there's a scholarship through the LSC to help pay for winter or summer break classes if they're necessary to help graduate (don't know how much you can get from that, like whether it's just one or multiple classes). On the social side...if you're in CMM, I'm sure you've heard of the leave of absence group? I found that moderately helpful, but I think it depends on how much you put yourself out there...like I'm pretty shit at social situations so I shied away from meeting up outside of the weekly meetings and I sort of regret not getting more involved. I never figured out how to socialize in the classroom setting tbh and only have met people through my jobs and a club. I'm not close to anyone, but it gives me some type of human interaction on a daily basis I guess (but, like you, I also hate small talk). I hope you have more luck figuring out how to socialize though. My inbox is open if you want to chat or have any questions.\n",

There's no harm in giving something a shot and then dropping it if things aren't working out. I'd give the same advice for your classes too, might as well take 5 and if it is too much just drop one before the deadline. I think the sooner you start on meeting new people, the better, as it will give you more time to find new friends and flesh out relationships with them. I was advised to take a relatively light courseload my first semester back, and it was definitely my best semester academically (I've heard that a lot of people feel that their returning semester is their best). If you're worried about credits there's a scholarship through the LSC to help pay for winter or summer break classes if they're necessary to help graduate (don't know how much you can get from that, like whether it's just one or multiple classes). On the social side...if you're in CMM, I'm sure you've heard of the leave of absence group? I found that moderately helpful, but I think it depends on how much you put yourself out there...like I'm pretty shit at social situations so I shied away from meeting up outside of the weekly meetings and I sort of regret not getting more involved. I never figured out how to socialize in the classroom setting tbh and only have met people through my jobs and a club. I'm not close to anyone, but it gives me some type of human interaction on a daily basis I guess (but, like you, I also hate small talk). I hope you have more luck figuring out how to socialize though. My inbox is open if you want to chat or have any questions. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  What do you mean? If you're talking about difficulty of coursework, it's going to be tough. You're essentially taking the biology major (if you aren't one already), which is full of courses filled with very smart people that are also graded to a curve. A lot of the courses are tough; organic chemistry and genetics are absolutely brutal. It's also very time-consuming; you won't be done taking pre-med courses until your junior year at least. And then there's the extracurriculars. You've got to set yourself apart from the competition, so now you have to get some sort of experience in the field (e.g. shadowing a doctor, volunteering as an EMT, etc.) or work in a research lab. And you've got to compete with other people for positions in those labs or for that membership on the university's EMS squad. And every other person is going to bring their own strengths to the table.  Not to mention the med school application process. You apply to 20+ schools, get an interview from a handful, and get accepted into 1 or 2 schools. It's a stressful process that can involve traveling to different states while in school. You have to take the MCATs, ensure your GPA is competitive, line up your extracurriculars, write out personal statements...All for an approximately 7% chance of getting into a medical school.  Pre-med at Cornell is hard. Very hard. The attrition rate is fairly high. Speaking as a pre-med that dropped it fairly late, it isn't for everybody. Better to figure it out sooner rather than later, and definitely have a back-up plan; I was lucky in that I discovered something else very quickly I was passionate about.\n",

            "commented_here  So, she's a really bad professor. I took her class last semester, and no one understood her lectures, the problem sets were awful, the TAs were rarely helpful, and most of the time she couldn't solve the problems that she wrote. Our exams were often extended because by the 1.5 hour mark people were maybe halfway finished.  However, she grades really nicely. The class isn't curved, but she basically calculates raw scores at the end of the class, assigns the lowest score a C+ and the highest an A, and breaks up grades from there based on a linear scale. The median grade tends to be B+ or B, which is the reason why a lot of people take BEE 2220 instead of MAE or CEE thermo.  Also, she's super nice. We often compared her to that stereotypical grandma who wants to help you with your homework because she cares so much, but understands so little of it that she actually makes it worse. I think she just genuinely doesn't understand that no one understands the material, and given how she grades, students don't complain to the department, so there's no incentive to better her teaching.\n",

Seriously, everyone jokes about it but it can get really cold, especially in the harsher winters and especially if you're from more southerly climes. Like omg mentioned, jeans are a must, and you will get a lot of mileage out of a good sweater or fleece. I recommend comfortable pants for sleeping, and socks of all varieties (normal, thicker, maybe some shorter sports socks). Invest in a good weather-proof jacket. If you're a poncho person that's fine, but a lightweight, water-proof coat with some insulation to it will see use in all seasons. Snow usually begins around October and in more typical winters (unlike 11-12) starts in earnest in November. During my pre-frosh visit in Cornell Days a few years back, we got snow in April. Be prepared. On the other hand, you definitely want clothing for the nicer days. Shorts, even though they will likely be tucked away for much of the winter, are good to have during the warmer months. There are areas to swim nearby, and Teagle Pool, so don't come without bathing suits. Comfortable t-shirts are good year-round, and if it isn't already you should make flannel your friend. Also boots. My footwear of choice around campus was a pair of sturdy, water-proof hiking boots for much of my college career, until they wore out from all the use. Time to replace them, in fact. I myself am a Long Islander, so I can tell you from experience that it's not too much of an adjustment climate-wise, but the winters can be tough if it's a bad year.

It is a lot of work (like a lot more than 2210), but you don't need to know multivar or linear algebra beforehand. If you are more interested in physics, i recommend phys1116 and math 1920 or 2210 (or even 2220) The problem with the arts math sequence is that physics requires multivar before it requires linalg, but in the arts math sequence linalg is the prereq to multivar. some people just take 2220 anyway, a lot of people do 1920. i think it depends on what kind of math class you want and whether you're willing to wait a semester if u take 2210 or if you want to take the engineering math track etc\n",

I can't answer all of your questions, but I'll take a shot at a couple! * 1: Pretty sure you don't need a background in multi or linear algebra to take 2230 - it's just a more theoretical version. Honestly, I took 2210, and it's not bad but it is ridiculously boring. Also, it can be great to figure out early on if you're into proving things  whatnot. I took an \"honors\" (more theory- and proving-based) calc II class and it was the absolute coolest, plus a ton smaller than the regular one, which can be nice. But if you are really leaning toward 2210, taking it after calc is what most people do, from what I know, and should not be a problem. * 4: Balch has been great. I think it's got a reputation for being on the quieter side, which for me was a plus. Living in an all-women's dorm has not actually been, for me, all that noticeable. Most of my friends I made through classes or clubs, not room location.  The absolute best thing about Balch is the sink rooms. They are small closet-sized rooms between the dorm rooms, and they are incredibly convenient and I will miss them dearly. It also has great study lounges, with a piano and chandeliers and what look to me like fainting couches, just in case you are in need of any of those things while studying. Good location, too - closest to the central campus. (It is farther from the north campus dining halls, but I am rarely running late to a dining hall while I am often running late to classes, so I approve of that trade-off.) The elevator, though, is very cranky and will not work if you don't shut the door all the way. Then the elevator not working makes everyone who lives on the fifth floor, like me, and has to walk up all those flights of stairs also very cranky. Please properly shut the door to the elevator when you live here. * 5: Bring a mini fridge. Printer is up to you. Since you're in Balch, the Tatkon Center is a great place to go for printing, since it's in the same building. Also, the kitchens in Balch have appliances and absolutely nothing else. If you want to cook at all, or even just want to know how much water you're putting into your microwave noodles, bring your own measuring cups/pans/pots and whatever else. It can be really hot at the beginning of the year, and while Balch has heating it does not have air conditioning. Bring a fan.  * 7: I think the 10 swipe meal plan is the most common, but I personally found it to be too many. I mean, if you're not eating breakfast, that's five lunches and five dinners a week that you have to eat at a dining hall. If you're on central campus at midday (which most people are) then your only choice will be Okenshields, which is...not great. You could do seven dinners and three lunches instead, but still at least one of your lunches would have to be on a weekday. I go to the Ivy Room most often, plus the Green Dragon for hot chocolate/coffee/snacks.\n",

            "commented_here  PAM is a public policy major that's more analytical, multidisciplinary and quantitative than public policy majors at other schools. I see PAM more as a mix of public policy, economics, and business (specifically health administration). With PAM, You take a range of courses from economics to statistics to government courses. Electives are fun and interesting. I personally think the major is a shit ton of reading and writing but it's easier than the average major at Cornell (I guess harder than ILR but easier than Economics at least in my opinion). Internship opportunities are up to you. Although it's a stigma that majoring in anything political science related and not business related won't get you a job, the job prospects are actually good if you know what you're doing (seeking internshi experience early, building relationships/networks, joining clubs). The median salary for PAM graduates tend to be 65-70k I think and most people end up getting a job out of college. Commonr fields include ibanking/finance, consulting (healthcare consulting I think is big in PAM especially with the health policy concentration), and other business fields.  Also side note, tbh, getting into anything lucrative (ibanking and consulting) is less about your major and more about you so if those are your goals, I wouldn't owrry too much (plus with PAM, if the employers ask in your interview, you can talk about how you are using your major to tailor it to both business and public policy). Class size is around 60-70 people I think. For electives, it's 30-50 people but for the intro class, it's like 120 people. The major also has a lot of flexibility so you can take a bunch of econ or business classes if you want to. Basically this major is perfect if you're big on a political science major that is quantitative and analytical than say a major in government.\n",

If you have completed the specialization, how was it? Depends on which one you choose. ECE was hell (3000+ level ECE classes can be quite hard). I'm sure other departments could have made it quite a bit easier to get the specialization without torturing oneself. <eos> \n",

            "commented_here  This class was the bane of my existence. 3410 and 3110 are the first official weeder courses for CS, so both are a lot of work and effort. I will say 3410 has a steep learning curve. Almost nothing you learned in 1110, 1112, 2110, etc will apply to this course in bulk. It's starts out with topics in hardware and logic, which lasts for about a month and a half, maybe two. The labs will have you building circuits in a program called Logisim, and honestly I found myself spending a fair amount of time on these labs (2-3 hours), but we had to submit labs by the end of the week so there was no pressure. The prelims also weren't so bad, as there was a pretty good online textbook to accompany the course and the slides were pretty good to complement the information in the text. So, what makes 3410 so hard then? The projects. I was in office hours almost every day trying to get these things done. The TAs themselves admitted the learning curve for the projects are steep, and it only gets steeper. Our first project was building an ALU in Logisim, which would basically take in binary numbers and perform arithmetic/logical operations on them. Having never done anything of the sort before, this project was really hard. Later on, you'll have to build something called MIPS, which is split up into two projects since it's just so big a task. I easily spent 15-20 hours a week on this project. I will say the course intensity dies down a little after half of the projects are over, but the last project is usually a doozy.  No final though, so yay... Also TAs are super helpful and I definitely couldn't have gotten through the course without their help.\n",

The course discusses basics of AI concepts like breadth-first search, graph structures, and set covering as well as basic optimization techniques like linear programming and integer programming. It definitely requires some math background, not necessarily stats. If you did high school math on the level of AP calc 2, you should be fine with the math.  Since it is not an overly technical class, the stress is more on the big picture of computer science algorithms solving sustainability problems than grinding over precision in the algorithms. No class is a prereq for undergrad research at Cornell, but classes under an instructor puts you in good light if you perform well. Then the instructor knows you well to judge if the lab will be suitable for you. As far as the institute is concerned, I would say that the class does prepare you well for the types of problems and techniques the lab deals with.\n",

Also, since Cornell is a good and expensive school, international students tend to be more well off and have families and lives back home, so they could just be protecting their own asses. Additionally, Cornell has a pretty good relationship with Taiwan (like presidents Lee and Tsai and they actively recruit from there), which is a touchy political subject in it of itself.  As an ABC who grew up with traditional too, my parents definitely had opinions about China and I just don't bring up politically charged topics in general with regard to America or elsewhere, especially because I just don't want to hear it. You could also just pretend to not understand what they're saying, and the conversation won't be brought up. I'm pretty sure most of the Chinese students I've interacted with don't know what level of Mandarin I understand, and I don't volunteer it up. Some people just want to push their world view onto others, so there's no really stopping them from making uncomfortable political comments if they know you'll listen.  What's interesting is the type of person who does this. I remember watching a video about Tianamen and the aftermath in high school, and one 1.5 generation Chinese person was dismissing the film, saying how it wasn't fair and that it painted a horrible picture of China, but a lot of non-Chinese students thought that the film had really glossed over deep shit that happened. Other students that were either second-gen or had more white-washed parents also didn't find the depiction terrible. Again, I just try to avoid the conversation with international students.

Our neighbors' only furniture arrangement possibility barely fit the furniture inside the room, much less left room to walk. Is it really that much better than Sheldon...?

Is working at a hotel/restaurant the summer/year before apps adequate? <eos> ', \"<bos> I will be applying to schools soon and already had a list set, but at my father's urging I am adding some more prestigious schools to my list. I honestly doubt I will get into Cornell but I like the school quite a bit and they are very good with financial aid so I will be applying. If you could take some time to tell me if you think I have a chance it would be greatly appreciated. Below are my stats: GPA: 3.5 ACT: 31 I founded a charity for poor children in the Philippines that works with a convent, I started two clubs at my school one visiting wounded veterans and another strengthening relationships with alumni in an effort to increase donations. I also am a head coach for AAU basketball and have been since my freshman year. I am the editor of this year's yearbook. That is the extent of my leadership.  My other extracurriculars include a job as a sports writer/social media manager for a website (chatsports.com), programming, I threw shotput for the track team for three years and am a member of the school newspaper. I am a hispanic (which my father also thinks will make a significant impact, though I am doubtful), first generation college student, male. Also at the moment both of my parents are unemployed (not sure if that would make a difference). I take one of the most challenging course loads my school offers, so while the 3.5 is low it is not as if I am taking all easy classes. I know that is not an excuse, though. I do like Cornell quite a bit and it would be great to get in, but I do not have my heart set on it simply because I feel it is a long shot.  Am I alone in thinking my application would be laughed at by a Cornell admissions counselor? Also, could you lend any advice as to whether applying ED would be beneficial or not? Thank you in advance... <eos> \", \"<bos> I am an ESS major but now I know it's not what I want to do. I have no idea what classes I need to take first semester and I feel like I am just picking random classes at this point. I don't want to get absorbed into taking classes for this major and not be able to change at my first opportunity. Can someone help me to create a course schedule?

(I'm considering a minor in information science as well): * CS 1110 * Math 1120 * Span 1230 * Astronomy 1101 (W/O lab) * FWS (The Greek Myth one) * Intermediate Squash I know this could be a lot for the first semester, which is why I'm prepared to drop a course if it's too much. <eos> \", \"<bos> I've never gone before but I want to start - Endless Mountain Skydivers is where I'm looking to go (2hrs away).

I've recently been accepted to Cornell's School of Engineering with the intention of studying Computer Science. I come from Southwest Virginia, and I've narrowed down my choices to the University of Virginia and Cornell. I was hoping some of you could give me a little insight to help my decision process move along. I would be ecstatic to attend Cornell, especially because of their amazing CS program, but I've heard some things about the Cornell experience that have given me a couple reservations. I know the area is beautiful, but I do not do very well in the cold or chronically dreary... though I feel that that is something I could get used to if need be. Second, I know that the academics are rigorous and, quite honestly, brutal. I wanted to know the degree of truth behind that, and whether or not it really provides for a miserable experience. Another problem is just how much I love UVA! It's a lot closer to home, and I know I'd be perfectly happy there, while I'm a little unsure about my potential happiness at Cornell. I'd appreciate any insight! Thanks! <eos> \", '<bos> Hey guys. I was wondering what would say is the career prospects with this degree. I have an undergrad degree in Industrial Engineering,  so I am curious to know how the masters program for you guys here is. Is is too technical? How are the projects? Any and all information is greatly appreciated.  Also, additionally, how are the job prospects for the international students that graduated with this degree?  <eos> ', '<bos> [url link] does anyone know what class this is? can freshman take it if they got a 5 on calc bc?  <eos> ', \"<bos> whats a good gpa after the first semester? also what's the average freshman gpa, and how would a 3.3 be for a cs major <eos> \"]\n",

They just want to see that you know what you're getting into before you get into it. <eos> \", '<bos> While I\\'m not so sure about the academics, you seem to have really good extra curriculars. And your dad was right, being hispanic and a first generation college student will help you. Its debatable how much it will help, but it definitely does help. You may be slightly on the lower end academically but I think the other factors would definitely be enough to give you a good shot. lol u r so much better than what i had and i got in. Im mexican, gpa: 3.75, sat: 2110, act: 32, extracurriculars: academic decathlon, basically no volunteer work. I\\'d say u have a good chance Personally, I think you sound like you\\'ll definitely make it into the \"this person deserves to go here\" pile, like thousands of other people who will eventually get rejected. Will you be accepted? Who knows. Advisor\\'s hate to say it, but I think getting into Cornell is 75% work (which you seem to have already done) and 25% luck. So I say apply anyway. You sound like a great candidate, and you might just get in! Applying ED just puts you into a smaller application pool and would give you a small leg up, but if you don\\'t know that Cornell is the perfect fit for you, it might not be worth the ED application. Good luck with your application, and I hope you get in to every college you apply to (but you ultimately go to Cornell). The worst thing that could happen is that you apply and the admissions office says, \"no.\" Who cares? Cornell was my second on my list, and that doesn\\'t bother me. If you get in, fine. If you don\\'t, there are obviously tons of other amazing schools. Avoid worrying. You\\'ll do fine. Enjoy your senior year. I just graduated last May. I really loved my time there. I met awesome people, took awesome classes, and Cornell has really opened doors for me. I didn\\'t go there for the \"name\", but saying \"I went to Cornell\" has made people really look at my application to jobs. From there, I\\'m on my own, but a foot in the door is a great help. Looking at your interests, Cornell could have a lot to offer you. We have a great newspaper, a great track and field team, and lots of fun programming classes you can take. One of my roommates wanted to form a NGO. Cornell not only supported her efforts, but she was able to receive funding to travel to conferences. <eos> ', \"<bos> So for freshman year (if you're not an incoming freshman my apologies for assuming), there are some basic classes that you should take early regardless of major. You should take a FWS fall semester. It looks like you have to take NTRES 1101: Introduction to Environmental Science and Sustainability in the fall of your freshman year, so have to take that regardless. If you want switch out of ESS later, see if you can use that credit for a gen-ed, but its not that big of a deal to be sure you fulfill your ESS reqs. You should take an introductory bio like BIOEE 1610 because its (a) mostly universal to all majors, (b) fulfills CALS gen-eds, (c) a prereq for most of your ESS classes later. I highly recommend you take a chemistry class (CHEM 1560 or 2070) and a math class if you have space or can handle the courseload. Maybe a [PE]([url link] if you want. *FWS (3 credits) *NTRES 1101 (3) *CHEM 2070 (4) *BIOEE 1610 (3-4) *PE (1) *Maybe a calc or stats class (4) If you haven't found these yet: [your program info and classes]([url link] [your curriculum a la CALS website]([url link] [your CALS general requirements]([url link] <eos> \", \"<bos> Almost my first semester exactly. You will have plenty of time to chill and enjoy yourself. Spanish was my hardest class that semester; 4 classes a week is brutal, especially when you have homework everyday and you fucking hate spanish Edit: Take Bowling for your PE credit I think this is a good first semester! Transitioning to college is a big step and if you don't know what to take thats totally fine. Cornell is not a race at all so don't ever feel pressured to take a heavy course workload. Also I think CS 1110 is a great class if you are deciding if you want to be a CS major although I would not describe is as easy. Its not as hard by far as the high level CS classes but it is no high school class. Feel free to reach out if you have questions! Welcome to Cornell! <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm definitely interested - when did you have in mind? There is skydiving in Ovid, NY which is between Cayuga and Seneca Lake. Also, since you are in the outing club, do you have any camping/hiking trips planned for the rest of the semester? I am very interested!! <eos> \", \"<bos> My family was living in NoVa at the time I attended college. Of the schools I was accepted to, I narrowed it down to UVa and Cornell. I opted to attend Cornell. Part of my decision was in the quality of the engineering program, but it mostly came down to feeling like I fit in. My happy and unhappy experiences had little to do with academics (it was surprisingly liberating to not be the smartest person in class) or the weather (though I can empathize with people who have seasonal affective disorder). My level of happiness was based mostly on the many relationships that were made during my tenure, of which some last to this day while others faded away. I know a lot of people who see being close to home as an advantage, but do not discount the growth experience of leaving the nest. It's important to meet people with different perspectives. UVa would have been the more financially prudent choice, but Cornell fit my personality more and allowed me the opportunity to grow.  If you have the chance, make sure to schedule a visit to each campus and meet the students, and really get a feel for what it's like. If you can do it during Cornell Days, I highly recommend doing an overnight stay. And if you ultimately attend, make sure to participate in the engineering co-op program, that way you'll be able to spend a summer in Ithaca. <eos> \", '<bos> [2016 job report]([url link]  Contains international info on pg. 2 <eos> ', \"<bos> As other people have said, it's MATH 2230. Honestly, though, if the extent of your math experience is a 5 on AP Calculus BC, you're unlikely to do well. I got 5 on AP Calc BC, and also took Multivariable + Linear Algebra, as well as having decent competitive math experience and strong competitive programming experience in high school to boot, and I still find it to be the most difficult by far of all my classes (which include CS 3110). Most of the people in the class are freshman, but nearly everybody in the class (that I talk to, anyhow), have taken Lin Alg + Multi. I'm not saying there's no way you could take the class, but if the extent of your math experience is a 5 on Calc BC, I would not suggest taking the class. <eos> \", \"<bos> Boi, 3.3 is a B+, that's fine. The vast majority of CS majors don't get their masters. I'm a Senior CS major. My freshmen year first semester was by far my lowest GPA (3.12) and it steadily rose every semester as I learned to handle Cornell's work load. Either way I can tell you that I was never asked about my GPA by companies during interviews and it didn't seem to affect my prospects of getting those interviews in the first place. <eos> \"]\n",

I'm pretty sure I made it after looking at the GPA/credit requirements, but have not yet been notified.  Thanks!  <s>  For engineering they get sent in mid to late January. May be a while, depending on how your registrar does things, but it seem like they do it quite soon after the semester ends to rank ILRies. For engineering, I didn't get the notification for my first fall semester until the following June, but it was already denoted on my transcript.   ILR seems to have pretty set guidelines for dean's list: GPA minimum (not rounded), 12 letter graded credits, successful completion of all courses. If you meet those, you'll eventually get the line on your transcript. Also, dean's list as a distinction is kind of meaningless, but I guess it's a thing to have. I'm in CALS and I received my notification about a week ago? Give or take a few days. (Break has altered my perspective of time)  Check your email for updates. Good luck!<eos> \", \"<bos> Is anyone here a Viticulture and Enology major? I assume that very few people are in that major, so is it extremely competitive to get in when applying as this major? <s>  viticulture is such a niche field that i think if you have a strong enough fit, it'd be much easier and much less competitive  there are only 6 viticulture graduates a year according to the post graduate report... Holy shit that's such a cool degree.  I didn't even know that was a thing you could major in.  Do it.<eos> \", \"<bos> I am debato whether I should do it  <s>  Hi debato I'm dad Minors inherently aren't \\\\*super\\\\* valuable, but I think CS is the closest to a valuable minor. But what they are good for is demonstrating interest in a field, so if you want to learn about CS and you find it interesting, you should go for it. One other way to phrase this is what do you gain by not doing it? CS and business are like the only valuable minors in that they give you a pathway to the field without majoring in it. Just a personal experience, one of my friends just graduated with an environmental engineering major and CS minor and now he’s going to work at Microsoft as a software developer.<eos> \", \"<bos> I'm currently torn between 4110 and 4820, after finding out I didn't get 3110 consulting. Its my understanding that taking 4110 really helps getting on the 3110 course staff, but since I'm a rising junior, and I'll (hopefully) be doing coding interviews this fall, I was wondering how much 4820 actually helps with answering coding questions, or if going through hackerrank and Cracking the Coding interview is sufficient.  <s>  delete First half of algo is pretty relevant, everything up to DP/D&amp;Q. I found DP pretty useful as a general introduction. Anything after max-flow not so much. You'll need to practice interview questions either way - taking algo alone is not enough if that's what you're asking but 4820 helps a lot towards learning how to approach solving these types of problems and you'll be an expert at complexity analysis if you aren't already. I took it with Kleinberg in SP17 YMMV. Also interview questions are often quite a bit different than the types of questions you'll encounter in algo psets (psets much harder), so like I said 4820 alone is not enough. No, there’s no reason to do that 2300 is one of the more work intensive classes out there. If you enroll in the acsu pre enroll piazza (CS 0000) you’ll find things like this discussed more in depth Have the decisions for 3110 consulting/TA already been released? Did you get an email saying you weren't chosen or do you know someone else that got chosen? Just curious as I also applied to 3110 and didn't hear anything yet. Thanks. Would you guys say taking CS 4820 + CS 3110 + ECE 2300 is doable? If taking ECE 2300 alongside the other two courses is too much, does taking CS 4820 early outweigh the benefits of ECE 2300 + CS 3420?<eos> \", \"<bos> Hi all - I've been put in the unfortunate situation where, as a grad student, I've to take one upper-level math course; Intro to Applied Mathematics being one of my options (and seemingly, one of the less-scary ones!).  It's been 4 years since I've taken undergraduate math courses, with calculus 1 + 2 being my only required math courses back then.  As someone without any knowledge of the Cornell math department, can anyone comment on TAM 3100?  Pain in the ass?  Cakewalk?  Or would I be better off taking an alternate?  Any insight is much appreciated~! <s>  I believe it's MAE 3100 now, just btw. I don't have advice for you, but I feel like you should get free beers at BRB for the rest of the semester. I took this class Fall 2009 as a junior in undergrad Eng program. The material is not difficult. The main thing with this class is that the homework can be time consuming and tedious. But once you do the work, the exams are straight forward. Is Phoenix teaching it this fall? Yes.<eos> \", \"<bos> Has anyone who applied to be a TA for CS 2800 and submitted the supplemental questionnaire heard back regarding whether or not they got the position? I got an email today from the CS department saying that all faculty in CS/IS have made their invitations for TA/Consulting positions, but I have not heard either yes or no from 2800, so I am a bit confused.\\n\\nEdit: the context behind the email is that I was already offered a position for 2110 a week ago, and the email said that all faculty are done making invitations earlier than expected so I should go accept my position. \\n\\nDid anyone who got offered a position in another class get this email? <s>  You don’t get a rejection email. They just ghost you. Well shit. I never got an email from the CS department saying that? Faculty don't necessarily send a notice if you are not invited to join the course staff, but I know several faculty members have definitely not completed sending out invitations to potential staff members so I'm quite sure the email was sent by mistake or a misunderstanding. Have decisions been released for CS 1110?<eos> \", '<bos> I was just admitted off the wait list for CHE. I want to go to London for a year, and take some time off. How do I do that - any advice?\\n\\nUPDATE--- I just called, and they denied me one. My family is in London, and I really want to see them. Please tell me there is some sort of appeals process <s>  When I wanted to take a gap year I just sent an email to admissions saying so and their response was basically \"Great, see you next year\". This was in 2008 so things may have changed since then, but an email to admissions will still probably get you moving in the right direction. Yeah either call or email addmissions and they\\'ll point you in the right direction. When I took a gap year a couple years ago they did ask for a reason, so just have one ready. They don\\'t seem to be too strict though. What about a leave of absence? unfortunately your situation is different than the other posters because you were admitted off the wait list and admissions expects you to attend the year they extended the offer. i know it’s kind of unfair that people who got in earlier have more of a say in deciding their plans but it’s the nature of the beast…try to email them back and see what they say, but chances are you’ll have to attend your first semester if you want to keep your spot. if you really want to go to london you can probably take your second semester off<eos> ', \"<bos> Hi, I'm a prefrosh and I recently received a letter about the Human Ecology Peer Partnership Program. I was wondering if any of y'all have any experience with the program and if you think it is worth participating in. <s>  I was in it! It was pretty fun, I'm still friends with a bunch of people who were in it too.<eos> \", \"<bos> It's through the Telluride Association Summer Program.\\nI'm incredibly excited! <s>  My friend did Telluride and absolutely loved the program. He's still great friends with the people he met that summer. I don't really have any advice, though I'll be on campus for the summer. Have a great time! Day drink as much as possible. Food is great. I'm pretty sure they have a cook in the TASP house who makes you food (which I heard is awesome), but there are also some great restaurants in Collegetown and on the Commons that are worth checking out. Also, make sure to hit up the Terrace restaurant in the Statler to get a salad at some point (sesame ginger dressing!), they're the best. Congrats buddy - I'll be at the other site this summer, but I've been to Cornell through Model UN. It's absolutely beautiful, and you should definitely take the time to walk around the campus, especially the Arts Quad and the Johnson Museum. I'm sure you'll find better advice for places to eat from Cornell redditors, but I distinctly remember some excellent falafel in Collegetown. Yep. On that Darwinism-Politics flow.<eos> \", '<bos> Hi! I’m an incoming freshman and was just wondering if any of y’all had any advice for having an enjoyable time at Outdoor Odyssey and/or freshman orientation or nice anecdotes about your experiences at either of these. Thanks! <s>  Never did outdoor odyssey but for o-week, the biggest piece of advice I found is just be yourself. It’s gonna sound campy and cliche but it’s true. Far too many freshmen I know tried to act a certain way or put on a front to make friends and have that O-week squad. In reality, you probably won’t talk to most kids you meet during O-week by the end of the semester. I talk to exactly two people I met during o week. I did Outdoor Odyssey (called Wilderness Reflections at the time) and I loved it - I ended up returning as a guide for the next three years. For me, it was a great way to meet friends (so I already knew some people before orientation) and I ended up taking and teaching several classes for Cornell Outdoor Education because I got into rock climbing during the trip. I\\'m not sure I have much specific advice - most aspects of the trip are planned out for you. I guess I\\'d just say to really embrace the experience - there\\'s a reason why they don\\'t allow you to use electronics. You\\'re away from home but so is everyone else and so you should try to enjoy the place and the people you\\'re with. I stayed friends with some of the people I met through Odyssey for my entire four years at Cornell. Go to O-week events, even if you are going alone. Almost everyone will be in the same position as you. You will see people with \"squads\" and wonder how that happened so fast and possibly feel rather lonely. However, most people will be thinking the same thing. Last year, Cornell Cinema had some free movie viewings and I went, even though I didn\\'t know anyone going. The movies were fun plus I got to walk around and see campus. I didn\\'t know any of the people sitting near me in the theater but we talked about the movie on the way back to north campus. It was a nice way to interact with people over a common interest. I\\'d say the actual orientation experience will differ based on your orientation leader and orientation group. Mine was pretty chill/low effort so we didn\\'t meet too much and the people in my group weren\\'t super talkative (I wasn\\'t either). But I\\'ve heard of some OLs who invite their freshmen to parties and stuff so it could go either way. i thought odyssey was okay but i had a really mean guide lol, all my friends i met later on said they loved it. many of them wound up being super involved in the COE scene as well, i think you’ll have a great time. if you’re doing a straight up backpacking one like i did make sure you’re in decent shape and be aware you’ll probably hike a lot more per day than what they say on the website. maybe learn how to tie a bowline and truckers hitch. bring some snacks and wet wipes!!!<eos> ']\n",
