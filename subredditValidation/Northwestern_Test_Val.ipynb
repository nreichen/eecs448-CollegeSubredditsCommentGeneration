            "<bos> Hi all, I was offered a post-doc position with a lab at the NWU med school late last week. Obviously, this means I'll be working on the Chicago campus. My partner will be looking for work at one of the area hospitals which could be at almost any of them (still undetermined). Does anyone have any advice as to places to live or just general things to consider? We're mainly looking for apartments with a monthly rent of $1,000 - $3,000 (probably closer to the middle of that range, ideally). Safety and cleanliness are our main concerns, with location and size of the apartment following. We've never lived in Chicago, so any advice is appreciated. Also, are 6 month leases common, or are most apartments 12 month leases? Thanks in advance for any help. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> hi guys im a freshman this sounds so dumb but what are the exact percentages for the GPA tiers? is a 93 an A? or is it an A-??? im hella confused and im hella on the fence with a grade (got everything back, including the final paper grade), and it's a 93.25 so im hoping 93-100 is an A. this is for a soc 200 level class by the way if that matters. the grading criteria arent on the syllabus, and the friends that ive asked dont really know either lol and lmao if it is an A- would it be too extra to email and ask to have it be bumped up  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone! I’m a junior studying mechanical engineering and I have a bit of extra room in my schedule, so I'm trying to decide which of these I could add to my degree. BS/MS - because I rely heavily on financial aid, I would need to get this done at the same time as my undergrad. This is possible, but it would mean taking only mechanical engineering classes from here on out. I may need to take 5 classes one quarter. This sounds daunting, but since I’m in a position where it’s possible, I feel obligated to take advantage of it.   EECS minor - this would mean taking 2-3 EECS classes for the rest of my time here. I’m not a huge fan of computer science, but I am interested in mechatronics and robotics, and it would be very useful in those fields. I also feel like this is the most “useful” or \"lucrative\" option.  Design certificate - This would only be 6 or 7 classes, leaving more room for other courses I’d like to take just out of interest. I really enjoy 3D modeling but otherwise don’t have too much experience with design, so I’m worried I won’t be a good fit for the program. However, this is an area I’d really like to improve on. I worry that a “certificate” won’t really mean much to employers and that this won’t be valuable. However, it will help me to strengthen my portfolio and give me projects to talk about, which could be useful.   Or I could no none of these and just graduate early, haha. Does anyone have any experience with any of these? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!   TL;DR: if anyone has any experience with the BS/MS program, getting an EECS Minor, or the Segal Design Certificate, let me know your thoughts and if you’d recommend them!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently in my 6th semester at UC Berkeley (civil and environmental engineering) and have been struggling for a while. I don't mesh well with the school, 500 person classes, and have had some extremely stressful and negative experiences here. I originally chose Cal over NU back in 2011 and have been regretting that decision for a while. I'm going to talk to the transfers office, but does anyone have experience or know of other students who have transferred during their junior year? If I were to transfer, I'd still spend a full two years at NU despite being ~3 years into undergrad. Also, what's your best/worst experience at NU (academic, social, anything)? TLDR: Junior at Cal, my experience here is extremely negative, is it too late to transfer to NU? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was hoping that I could get some suggestions for which residence hall/college/community I should choose for next year. I am majoring in chemical engineering, so I am looking for dorms on the north side of campus. I'm not the most social and I don't foresee myself going to many parties, but I'd like to push myself to be as social as possible, especially during my first year. These are my top choices so far: Elder - I like that it is all freshman and I've heard that the social atmosphere is great. I am not a partier, however, so this might be a problem. From what I've heard, the rooms and bathrooms don't aren't the nicest. Ayers (CCI) - The rooms are supposed to be fairly large and I've heard that some of them have a view of the lake, which would be wonderful. It's also close to Tech and to the gym, which is nice. It seems to be fairly social, though not as much as Elder. Slivka - I've heard that the rooms here are the nicest on North Campus. There are private bathrooms, which is a definite benefit. It would also be nice to have more resources for engineering. However, I'm not sure that I want to be surrounded almost entirely by engineers, and this dorm does not seem to be the most social. CCS - the rooms themselves seem to be nice, and it seems like being in such a small dorm would create a strong sense of community. It might be hard to branch out to meet others, though. Any suggestions? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys i'm coming to NU this fall as a freshmen (going in undecided). I have a few quick questions about the school. I'm interested in going into either a science or engineering and wondering with the whole B.A vs B.S diplomas. I'm also interested in doing a study abroad program in Europe which would require me to take a language during college to prep me for that. So my questions are: 1. What are the main differences between a BA and BS program in a science like physics? Is it also easy to transfer from one to another?  2. If I choose to do a BS I'm assuming the schedule and classes would be a lot more rigourous? Would that allow me to still be able to study a language or is that not possible.  3. Is it common that people who are pursuing a BS in a science also able to take up a minor in something such as music? (while also being able to study a language if possible) I know that with a BA that the classes you can take are much more broad and give you that option i was just wondering if i choose to have a BS it would still give me that option If there's any other advice you guys could give me that would be very appreciated! Thanks!!! Can't wait to come this fall.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Could someone give a bit of information about each of the major fraternities and sororities on campus? (I mostly care about the fraternities, but thought both might as well be in the same place incase anyone else comes looking). For example: ABC is full of douche bags and all they they care about is getting hammered. XYZ is pretty chill, they party but they're also pretty smart, cool guys. Something along those lines would be superbly helpful.  Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi everyone!  I am a transfer student that didn't commit until June 24th because (despite my repeated asking and checking in) I did not receive an FA package until the 23rd. Since I hadn't even received my financial aid package until long after the housing app was due, I am looking into off campus housing. I also emailed housing to see if I can still submit the application, but I also wouldn't mind saving the money at an off-campus apt. However, I have no idea where to look. Where do you all go to find housing, and are they any leases / open rooms still available this late? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If I am applying ED, does NW get my first quarter grades or do they just use first 3 years of high school? The website looks like you only send senior grades if applying RD, but I’m not sure. It would take pressure off of me bc I’m worried I may get a B in English this first quarter. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys! So I was recently accepted as a transfer to McCormick. I'm interested in pursuing pharmaceutics and cancer research. I was wondering how tough it is to find a research lab position and engage in research-related clubs such as iGEM. I'm currently at a University of Washington which is a big public research university with tons of oppotunities especailly with the medical center next door but I'm not sure how the environment is at a smaller private university. This is probably my main concern for transferring. Any advice is appreciated!!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys! I'm assuming most of the users here are either students or graduates. I'm currently a senior in high school and Northwestern is the last application I am waiting on for good news and every day I get more and more excited about the school. I just want to ask you some questions about the school. What do you like most about it? What do you dislike the most about it? How are the residential colleges, for anybody living in one? how bad does the weather actually get? I know its a challenging school, but how often do kids complain about the classes? (some kids from other schools i have visited talk about how challenging their classes are, but i haven't heard anything about NU.) Is it worth the expensive sticker price? Thanks guys, maybe i'll ask some later. Also, saved my first post for you guys!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm hoping to come up for the Michigan basketball game tomorrow, but tickets are going for $35 on the official site and there's no secondary market for the game. Do people often scalp tickets for basketball games? Like if I came by with $20 cash would I be able to pick up a ticket? Secondarily, if I was with a group of people but we had tickets in different sections, could we still sit together or do staff enforce seat assignments? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I ask because it seems as though the acceptance rate is much higher than the rest of Northwestern. Is it just there as a money maker? What does the rest of Northwestern think of it these days?

            "<bos> Hi, sorry for another one of these posts, but just wondering about the best housing option for me if I’m a transfer junior Econ major? I see that residential colleges are more social than the halls? Which ones are more modern, have a gym inside, or are close to a dining hall? Also prefer there to be more upperclassmen than freshmen. Thanks. <eos> \n",

Do any of you happen have a single or season ticket that you can no longer use? I'm aware there are some on secondary ticket sites, but trying to avoid the upcharge and fees.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been thinking about the push by various student leaders to leave the Rock as is for the next week and a half. I'm not convinced this is the best thing to do for our community. It halts a NU tradition when we need to feel like a community the most. What say you? Is this a good, respectful move? Or does this fly in the face about what it means to be at Northwestern? <eos> \n",

My first choice is the new 2018 MacBook pro as its fast (6 core processing and 16 gb of RAM), light and easy to use, even if I need to download windows software on to it. My second choice is the surface book 2, which has touch screen capabilities, 1060 nvidia graphics, and has windows.  I personally don't want gaming laptops cause they're big and have a short battery life.  Which one would be better for the next four years? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi. Looking for other folks who might want to play eurogames once a week or so. There are two extant and very successful general groups, one in Evanston (every other Sunday afternoon at Panera Bread) and one in the city that has meetings everywhere -- most often at Mystic Celt in Wrigleyville, but... I just can't get enough. Anyone interested? Will play almost anything, even Catan. ;)  <eos> \n",

Fare for one-way is $3.50. You can take CTA if you prefer, but it's more convoluted and takes 30 extra minutes. Similarly, you can drive there, too, but unless you have a few passengers willing to pitch in for gas/parking, it may not be worth it. --- If you're interested in eating at [Blackbird]([url link] (operated by [Paul Kahan]([url link] for their [$22 Prix Fixe menu]([url link] RSVP in this thread **BY WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25 @ 12:00PM (NOON)**.  ~~I will cap the seating at 8 people.

I'm currently a first semester Freshman in Computer Science here, but my heart still belongs to NU. I was hoping to transfer, and was wondering if my chances are better as a transfer vs. as a HS student.  My current GPA is unknown (obviously havent finished any classes yet), but I'm fairly sure I will get a minimum of 3.5 GPA. My ACT score w/ writing was 33. What do you guys think? edit: I've looked at the [transfer application]([url link] and I know to do all that next Fall, but I was just wondering how this compares to anyone else who has transferred/is attending <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! I am applying as a transfer student to Weinberg, but I am actually already a student at Northwestern through SPS. I was working for a few years as a professional artist which is why I originally applied to SPS, but due to injury I have retired and would like to pursue my degree full time. I would like to transfer to Weinberg since they offer a wider range of degrees and classes than SPS. I guess I am wondering if anyone has gone through a similar process? Is there anything I should expect? Will my application be given different considerations given that I am an interschool transfer? I currently have a 3.85GPA, am taking courses through Weinberg by petition to show that I am capable, and all of my recommendations are from Northwestern professors (31ACT in case that's relevant). Any thoughts or relevant experiences are appreciated!  <eos> \n",

I’m guessing this will vary greatly depending on the department and boss. I’m starting a job as a staff member in the fall and was curious how others enjoyed it. I will be on the medical campus. It sounds like a great place to work but I wanted to hear from others.  <eos> \n",

I like to livestream on Twitch, but I'm worried about bugging my roommate since I generally do it rather early in the morning. I therefore am hoping to find some sort of space where I can stream without disturbing anyone (or being disturbed myself). I know that Shepard has a few private rooms available, but do any of the other residential buildings? I also saw that the main library has some, but they seemed to be mainly for groups of two or more. Any suggestions? <eos> \n",

Can anyone here please review the building from their personal experience? Is the place popular with other graduates? Are there any grocery stores nearby? Also, at $925 excluding utilities, is it a good deal or can we find something cheaper? Any feedback would be much appreciated! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm currently a freshman engineer at Cornell and am reconsidering my life given that I only ever considered Cornell or Carnegie Mellon before. My parents gave me a radius, so I never looked at NU before (I live in the North East), but it seems pretty cool. I might be interested in doing Engineering+Music, as I'm very musically inclined, I'm thinking mechanical or environmental. From college, I was hoping to go somewhere that I admire most other people around me, and I don't know if the grass really is greener in that sense because I haven't yet met the superstars I met at high school music/leadership conferences. I'd appreciate any help in regards to being an engineer, knowing anything comparing NU to Cornell, or the Music + engineering, or if my situation is relatable and you have feedback. Thanks! <eos> \n",

If I was placed into a lower class, would that mean that I would have to take more classes than those who placed higher?

My tour emphasized how the quarter system increases flexibility, but sort of skimmed over how difficult the classes themselves were. 2. How are the new dorms? We didn't go inside the residence halls, but my tour guide said that the dorms were all just renovated and that they're really nice now. 3. How big is Greek life there? Will I feel left out if I don't join or don't want to party? 4. Obviously most of NU's programs are going to be very strong, but are there any programs that are weak or at least not as strong as others? I plan on majoring in math, CS, physics, or engineering (actually part of the reason that I liked NU is because of the flexibility). 5. How long is the shuttle ride to Chicago? 6. Would you describe it as more collaborative or competitive? And how is the stress culture? 7. How is the food, both on and off campus? The tour guide said Evanston has great food and that NU's food is ranked like number 5 in the country, but I didn't actually get to try it. 8. Why did you end up picking NU?  9. Did you apply ED or RD, and why? What did you do in high school? And what were your top colleges before you went to NU? Also, if there's anything else you think I should know, please tell me! NU actually wasn't that high on the list of colleges I wanted to apply to before I came and visited, but now that I've seen it, I actually really like it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have been given the gracious opportunity to attend NU starting this coming Fall. I have some timely questions I wanted to ask to the NU Reddit community. Regardless of discipline, I'd love to hear from anyone!  As someone that's been accustomed to the semester system, how is the quarter really like for most of you? I'm aware of its pros/cons. Is the dread/stress/system really that bad? Are the benefits of being able to take more classes a bit overstated or worth it? I hear that 4 classes per quarter is the norm though I heard most resort to 3 in actuality. Would this experience perhaps differ across disciplines or is the dread/stress consistent throughout? As a possible incoming Weinberg student, I intend on double majoring in Global Health and Sociology with the medical/health concentration. I figure that the quarter system may be relatively rougher for STEM but just wanted to hear from you guys.  With the Spring quarter possibly conflicting with summer internships or even a summer semester at a different institution, are there ways to perhaps reschedule a final(s) to be a tad bit earlier? Particularly for Weinberg students? Or do professors have no control and it's really only by university policy? Even from glazing through the NU website, I've heard contrasting things. Some from \"real talk.\" In addition to the quarter experience for the social sciences/public health kiddos, i'd love to hear more about your experiences and perhaps unheard perks/niches from any student that is studying in these particular disciplines! Though I'm a premed student, I've done most of my prereqs coming into NU so I intend on solely focusing on these courses til potential graduation if I choose to come here. I'm torn between transferring to either Northwestern or Emory so I'm going down to the smallest details.  Sorry for the long wall of text. Thanks guys! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> My offer letter says \"As a full-time registered graduate student at Northwestern, you will be eligible to receive a full health insurance subsidy.\" On the health insurance website, it says \"The university plan premium for 2015-16 is $3,692.\" Does the \"full subsidy\" cover the $3,692, or will I need to pay that out of my fellowship? In addition, would it cover things like the annual deductible? Finally, how have you found the health plan, in general? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm applying to a labs as a potential post-doc. Had interviews that went well and I'm invited back for further interviewing and meeting teams in person. I'm trying to get an idea of what a standard salary is for post-docs at NU before I get an offer... before I *hopefully* get an offer. I'm not looking to make crazy amounts of money as a post-doc, but just want to make sure offers I'm receiving are fair. Obviously, there will be some variation depending on my prior experience and what lab and department I'm joining. I'm going to join labs in the NU Feinberg School of Medicine (at least with all the labs I'm interviewing with currently) in case that makes a difference. If anyone can give me an idea of a standard post-doc salary, I would appreciate it. Thanks. <eos> \n",

I’m an incoming freshman, and I’m currently not taking a language (I finished Spanish sophomore year of high school) so it would be quite a bit of self-study.

I took it with Professor Petrovsky-Shtern, and he special ordered a textbook that has \"Custom Edition for Northwestern University\" printed at the bottom of the front cover. It is chapters 9 - 19 of Volume 1 of the full text. Since it's a custom order, you'll probably be forced to buy it at Beck's/Norris. My copy has some highlighting in it, and I will give it to you in exchange for a chai latte. <eos> \n",

We're not super cereal about winning or anything; we're just doing this to say we competed in collegiate esports.

Excited to be visiting the beautiful (supposedly) campus in person, but unfortunately the STEM tours are full, and as a prospective stem student this is a bit of a bummer.  The school site says:  \"This tour highlights STEM facilities, research resources, pre-professional opportunities for STEM majors, and STEM-focused student organizations.\"  But what specifically would I miss?

            "<bos> Senior who is applying to NU here.  I love the idea of the Residential colleges and the great academic environment, but I can't help but wonder if I'll be surrounded by people who aren't super social and a bit too bookish/nerdy. I am perfectly fine with these people (in fact I probably am one myself), but in college I want to branch out a bit more and go to more parties/have that quintessential college experience. Do you know anyone in an RC or are you someone in one? What's their/your take on it? PS The ones i'm interested in are: ISRC, CCS, Shepard RC, and PARC. <eos> \n",

            "<bos>  Statement from President Schapiro regarding graffiti in Millar Chapel On behalf of the entire Northwestern community, I express our shock and dismay at the abhorrent act of vandalism committed last night in Alice Millar Chapel in which racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and other offensive graffiti was spray-painted on walls, offices and even the organ.  The investigation by University Police has determined that there is no immediate danger to any specific individual or to the larger campus community. Police are reviewing video of the incident and searching for those responsible. Once the perpetrators are identified, they will be arrested and charged to the fullest extent of the law.  Northwestern is committed to creating a safe, secure and welcoming environment for all of our students, faculty and staff. This disgusting act of hatred violates the deepest values and core commitments of our University and is an affront to us all.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, this post is geared towards NU students. In my essay I talked about visiting campus and being very impressed by the \"workshops\" in McCormick (I'm referring to the rooms with lots of equipment open for students to use to construct things and work on their own projects). However, I visited lots of campuses along with NU last summer and I can't remember if it was actually NU that had these. Could someone confirm or deny if McCormick really has these rooms available for their engineering undergrads? If so, is there a better, more specific way of describing them than \"workshops?\" Thank you so much for the help and happy new years! <eos> \n",

We know that Northwestern already has HackNU, so we know that there's a big interest in hacking on campus!  In case you don't know, hacking is an opportunity to create anything you want: mobile apps, web apps, hardware projects, etc! For 36 hours at UIUC, we want computer scientists and engineers to join us.  Put your .edu email into [hackillinois.org]([url link] and RSVP to our [Facebook event]([url link] to sign up! If there's enough people from NU, we can charter a free bus for you guys. <eos> \n",

I'm located in California, so the current health insurance I have isn't valid per NU's waiver requirements, and was hoping for some suggestions. <eos> \n",

I took macro/micro in junior year so I feel like I forgot a bit. How hard do you think the classes would be for me? Also any tips on the classes or suggestions on which profs to take them with? Also are there any interesting distros you guys would recommend? Any classes to avoid? Thanks!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys! I'm a high school senior from Sweden who's thinking about applying to Northwestern. I plan to major in Industrial Engineering, but I have a few questions. 1. How manageable is IE? I'm not really a big fan of maths, but I don't hate it either.  2. What's the social life like as an engineer student? Do you really have to study all the time?  3. What are the students at McCormick like? Do they tend to just focus on school or do they participate in other activities as well? 3. Chicago is one of the reasons I'm interested in NU. How often do you usually go there to go to parties, concerts, bars etc? 4. As an international student, will I get into the social scene as easy as the American freshmen do?  5. What is your overall experience at Northwestern? Thankful for any answers! <eos> \n",

Is there a lot of variety so it doesnt get too boring? How healthy/fresh is it? What are some of your favorite things about the food? Least favorite? Best dining halls? Any other comments? Thank you so much!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Does the northwestern debt cap scholarship a guarantee that NOBODY will graduate with over $20,000 in debt? I'm confused from the description if it's only awarded to certain people who will graduate with $20,000 debt or ALL of people who will. I've read it many times and searched all over online but I'm still unsure. Thank you Edit: also capping federal loans? Does that mean that the $20,000 figure excludes private loans?

            "<bos> Ok I know that we're not exactly the best in the conference and that we're the only private school in the Big Ten, but these past three games, the student section has been depressing. Even as we were coming off a huge win against Nebraska, there were still empty seats everywhere against Rice and Minnesota. Basically, why aren't students showing up to our games? Also, I'm using \"important\" in the title for lack of a better word. <eos> \n",

I visited northwestern during wildcat days and liked the campus, but I didn't get a chance to talk with any students. This may be strange, but are there any Wildcats that would be willing to discuss the school with me? I feel like it would be really beneficial to maybe have a phone conversation or something. If anyone has the time for this please pm me. Thank you all, go cats! (Maybe) <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have this sense that NU students quickly close themselves off after freshman year once they've established their main friend group, whether it's though clubs, greek life, sports, etc. This may be unique to the busy competitive premed culture that dominates my major, neuroscience, or it may be a more global trend for the entire school. How do other majors relate? As a community, how open and proactive do you think we are to continually branch out--especially in a way that embraces diversity?   <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey fellow Wildcats, Has anyone had success connecting an Xbox 360 to the network through sharing a WiFi connection from a laptop through ethernet to the xbox? I've gotten this to work at home, but at NU it never works. My friends have been able to do this with Windows machines, but with my Mac the Xbox always fails when it comes to resolving DNS servers. I've tried setting the DNS to my laptop's IP, googleDNS, and NU's default DNS servers all to no avail. I've also tried making the Xbox's MAC address the same as my computer. I've googled and googled and found no solution to this, help me Reddit, you're my only hope! **Edit:** Internet Connection Sharing sharing. Derp. **Edit 2:** I confirmed with a friend's PC that it works with no call to NUIT. However, I'll call them tomorrow as per jasonhe's suggestion to see if they know anything about why the Mac can't do it and how to get it running. <eos> \n",

My apartment includes 'wireless internet,' but it's MAC address based, 'no online video gaming,' and signs me into a LAN jungle - meaning if I or someone else gets careless with file sharing, anyone can see it.

I know that the theatre department is large, but outside of theatre (in medill/artssciences) is the lgbt community noticeable? Is the student body tolerant/liberal as a whole/is it easy to find an lgbt community? Also on a tangential-ish question, what North Campus dorms would be the most accepting? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I will most likely be doing Industrial Engineering. I have scored a 5 on Calc 1, Micro, Macro, and Stat (and hopefully will get a 5 on Physics C Mech, E and M, and Calc 2). Should I place out of as many classes as possible, or should I retake them? Also, is getting a 5 good enough to place out, or will I need to take another placement exam? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I really wanted to attend NU, and was ecstatic to be accepted. However, I didn't realize there were no merit based scholarships awarded to students - only need based aid.  My question for all of you Northwestern students and alumni, why do you think it costs so much to go to school there? Was it worth it? It's not too late for me to change my mind about attending. I can afford to go there, but can't really justify it to myself financially.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys! I'm an applicant accepted ED. I'm wondering these things after reading some comments/posts on this subreddit. I can deal with heavy academics and hard classes, but don't want to be in a bad, stressed out and unhappy environment with people in a bad mood/complaining all the time. I'd want to know this, as some users have mentioned these qualities on this subreddit about nu. Also, how hard is it to get a good gpa? (specifically in econ) Finally, do you agree with this comment that really struck me about NU? How could I avoid and recognize the \"toxic environment?\"  I am happy I went to Northwestern, but that stems from my recognition of the toxic environment and taking steps to make sure I don't get sucked into it. As long as you come in realizing that people often get jaded and stressed out at NU and work to combat that, there's plenty of good parts to NU.  <eos> \n",

I think for the first year, I would like to live on or very close to campus. I noticed that the university offers graduate housing in the form of apartments. I thought they might be ideal because they are already furnished, utilities are taken care of, and are close to campus. Has anyone ever lived in these places (specifically Engelhart Hall)? Are they worth the price? If not, where should I look for apartments and is anyone looking for a roommate? <eos> \n",

There were a lot of things I didn't know about the inner workings of a hotel, especially a nicef one like the Orrington. I was really suprised how differently Hilton Honors members aer treated compared to, say, a priceline booking. Also I never realized that the front desk guy has the power to pretty much do anything. Stuff like upgrades, comps, discounts. If we ever say we can't do something 90% of the time we just don't want to. Questions? <eos> \n",

Bienen offers rooms but require you to sign up for either courses or classes and residences seem to reserve them for their own students (which is fair). I wouldn't mind paying a fair rate either (~$10/month preferably). The Music Institute of Chicago goes for $12.50/hr, which I can't really afford. Does anybody have any ideas? <eos> \n",

When I did the school research, NU's statistics major is great but there is no specific concentration. But the IE major looks exactly what I want, specializing in data analysis.  The problem is that IE is in the engineering school and statistics is in arts and science. If I want to be safe and have a high chance of admission, Which school should I apply? Can people from arts and science participate in the research program offered by the engineering school? <eos> \n",

Any good contacts you could set me up with would be much appreciated. <eos> ', \"<bos> Hi all, I was offered a post-doc position with a lab at the NWU med school late last week. Obviously, this means I'll be working on the Chicago campus. My partner will be looking for work at one of the area hospitals which could be at almost any of them (still undetermined). Does anyone have any advice as to places to live or just general things to consider? We're mainly looking for apartments with a monthly rent of $1,000 - $3,000 (probably closer to the middle of that range, ideally). Safety and cleanliness are our main concerns, with location and size of the apartment following. We've never lived in Chicago, so any advice is appreciated. Also, are 6 month leases common, or are most apartments 12 month leases? Thanks in advance for any help. <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm a guitarist and songwriter.

I’m a junior studying mechanical engineering and I have a bit of extra room in my schedule, so I\\'m trying to decide which of these I could add to my degree. BS/MS - because I rely heavily on financial aid, I would need to get this done at the same time as my undergrad. This is possible, but it would mean taking only mechanical engineering classes from here on out. I may need to take 5 classes one quarter. This sounds daunting, but since I’m in a position where it’s possible, I feel obligated to take advantage of it.   EECS minor - this would mean taking 2-3 EECS classes for the rest of my time here. I’m not a huge fan of computer science, but I am interested in mechatronics and robotics, and it would be very useful in those fields. I also feel like this is the most “useful” or \"lucrative\" option.  Design certificate - This would only be 6 or 7 classes, leaving more room for other courses I’d like to take just out of interest. I really enjoy 3D modeling but otherwise don’t have too much experience with design, so I’m worried I won’t be a good fit for the program. However, this is an area I’d really like to improve on. I worry that a “certificate” won’t really mean much to employers and that this won’t be valuable. However, it will help me to strengthen my portfolio and give me projects to talk about, which could be useful.   Or I could no none of these and just graduate early, haha. Does anyone have any experience with any of these? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I am majoring in chemical engineering, so I am looking for dorms on the north side of campus. I'm not the most social and I don't foresee myself going to many parties, but I'd like to push myself to be as social as possible, especially during my first year. These are my top choices so far: Elder - I like that it is all freshman and I've heard that the social atmosphere is great. I am not a partier, however, so this might be a problem. From what I've heard, the rooms and bathrooms don't aren't the nicest. Ayers (CCI) - The rooms are supposed to be fairly large and I've heard that some of them have a view of the lake, which would be wonderful. It's also close to Tech and to the gym, which is nice. It seems to be fairly social, though not as much as Elder. Slivka - I've heard that the rooms here are the nicest on North Campus. There are private bathrooms, which is a definite benefit. It would also be nice to have more resources for engineering. However, I'm not sure that I want to be surrounded almost entirely by engineers, and this dorm does not seem to be the most social. CCS - the rooms themselves seem to be nice, and it seems like being in such a small dorm would create a strong sense of community. It might be hard to branch out to meet others, though.

I'm interested in going into either a science or engineering and wondering with the whole B.A vs B.S diplomas. I'm also interested in doing a study abroad program in Europe which would require me to take a language during college to prep me for that. So my questions are: 1. What are the main differences between a BA and BS program in a science like physics? Is it also easy to transfer from one to another?  2. If I choose to do a BS I'm assuming the schedule and classes would be a lot more rigourous? Would that allow me to still be able to study a language or is that not possible.  3. Is it common that people who are pursuing a BS in a science also able to take up a minor in something such as music? (while also being able to study a language if possible) I know that with a BA that the classes you can take are much more broad and give you that option i was just wondering if i choose to have a BS it would still give me that option If there's any other advice you guys could give me that would be very appreciated!

Is the dread/stress/system really that bad? Are the benefits of being able to take more classes a bit overstated or worth it?

Excited to be visiting the beautiful (supposedly) campus in person, but unfortunately the STEM tours are full, and as a prospective stem student this is a bit of a bummer.

I love the idea of the Residential colleges and the great academic environment, but I can't help but wonder if I'll be surrounded by people who aren't super social and a bit too bookish/nerdy.

The investigation by University Police has determined that there is no immediate danger to any specific individual or to the larger campus community. Police are reviewing video of the incident and searching for those responsible. Once the perpetrators are identified, they will be arrested and charged to the fullest extent of the law.  Northwestern is committed to creating a safe, secure and welcoming environment for all of our students, faculty and staff. This disgusting act of hatred violates the deepest values and core commitments of our University and is an affront to us all.  <eos> ', '<bos> Anyone know what was going on? <eos> ', '<bos> Which major would be better for someone with a lower math ACT score, and what are the differences?

In my essay I talked about visiting campus and being very impressed by the \"workshops\" in McCormick (I\\'m referring to the rooms with lots of equipment open for students to use to construct things and work on their own projects). However, I visited lots of campuses along with NU last summer and I can\\'t remember if it was actually NU that had these. Could someone confirm or deny if McCormick really has these rooms available for their engineering undergrads? If so, is there a better, more specific way of describing them than \"workshops?\" Thank you so much for the help and happy new years! <eos> ', \"<bos> Hey Big Ten friends, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is hosting a brand new hackathon called [HackIllinois]([url link] on April 11th-13th, and we want NU to attend!

How manageable is IE? I'm not really a big fan of maths, but I don't hate it either.  2. What's the social life like as an engineer student? Do you really have to study all the time?  3. What are the students at McCormick like? Do they tend to just focus on school or do they participate in other activities as well? 3. Chicago is one of the reasons I'm interested in NU.

            " So the common places people at the med campus seem to live are: -Streeterville ($$$) -Various suburbs, a lot in the western suburbs (probably a long commute, probably going to need to drive, especially if you'll be doing anything in lab at odd times) -Lakeview ($$) -Lincoln Park ($$ to $$$) -Rogers Park ($, long-ish commute, but there's a shuttle stop that takes 20-40 minutes depending on the time of day) -Evanston ($$, long commute, also serviced by the shuttle, but will still take a while) I know a handful of people who live in other places like the south loop, west loop, or Bucktown/Wicker Park area, or Logan Square. Really, movement around Chicago compared to most US cities is pretty agreeable and as a postdoc you will probably have a decent control over your life, so you can live wherever you want. Maybe poke around /r/Chicago for some more info on the city in general. I also don't really agree w/ the post below me. It might be easier to find a broker/real estate agent maybe for your first move in Chicago, but most housing in Chicago happens over Craigslist. It's reliable once you get a feel for what price range you should be looking in for the area/type of apartment you want. It's typically pretty painless and quick to take a look at a unit (just be ready to sign if you like it--also check Bedbugregistry.com on your phone as soon as you know the address, as Chicago has one of the worst problems in the US for bedbugs). Usually you'll want to look up to 1-2 months ahead of when you want to move in (best stuff will typically be 1 month before, but this depends on the time of year you want to move in/out), and just peruse things. This is a lot easier to do once you're already in the city and I *highly* suggest doing it and considering wherever you move in for the first year to be temporary. A relatively safe, relatively nice, cheap (and probably farther out from downtown) neighborhood in one of the two really major public transit tracks of the city (the red line and blue line) like Rogers Park or Logan Square might run you something like 800-1000 for a typical 1br (1000-1400 for a \"luxury\"/high amenities unit), a more middle-priced neighborhood like Lakeview or tracts of Lincoln Park will probably push that limit up around 200-300 dollars. Downtown is sort of a mixed bag. Most of the actual housing stock downtown is pretty nice, but the sizes vary really widely and price seems related to that.  \n"

            "GENERATED COMMENTS: I'm currently in my 6th semester at UC Berkeley (civil and environmental engineering) and have been struggling for a while. I don't mesh well with the school, 500 person classes, and have had some extremely stressful and negative experiences here. I originally chose Cal over NU back in 2011 and have been regretting that decision for a while. I'm going to talk to the transfers office, but does anyone have experience or know of other students who have transferred during their junior year? If I were to transfer, I'd still spend a full two years at NU despite being ~3 years into undergrad. Also, what's your best/worst experience at NU (academic, social, anything)? TLDR: Junior at Cal, my experience here is extremely negative, is it too late to transfer to NU?    I would definitely apply to a large university like NU. Even though you're not 100% sure, transferring doesn't really change your experience, so why not apply? Thanks!\n",
            "Reference COMMENTS: There is a certain minimum number of credits that you must complete at Northwestern. I don't know what it is off the top of my head, but it is something like 50% of the credits (I could be wrong, but it's somewhere around that). So, theoretically you could transfer, but you wouldn't be able to transfer all of your credits, and you would quite probably have to take classes that you've already taken over again. It probably doesn't make much sense for you to transfer now, unless you don't mind spending a ton more money, and re-taking classes. Hope this helps. Transfer here.  You must take classes for two years if you transfer. Many credits won't transfer over. We're talking $120,000 minimum.  Also, the grass is always greener on the other side.  \n"
