Stadium lot is actually mainly Zone B. Turns out that even though there are no signs saying this when you enter from Woody Hayes (who doesn't?) only the first three rows are Zone C.

I passed 1075 at CSCC, only with the help of a one-on-one tutor and lots of annoying emails to the professor. I can pick any of the following for the GEC: Math 1116, 1130 or 1148. Linguistics 2001, 3802. Philosophy 1500, 1501 or 2500. My advisor offered no suggestions on which courses would be best, given my situation.

I know these can be annoying and time consuming, but I was hoping that the great people of the r/OSU community would be able to help me out for my class, and fill out a survey for me. My group needs to collect as much data as possible, and we would be very grateful for your help. Should only take about 5 minutes. Thanks!

Don't immediately go to your 'dream company'. Warm up on some companies you've never heard of, just to get in the career fair mood.

Does anyone have some helpful hints on how to solve these problems? (Prof. Walker). It's all about angular momentum, velocity, acceleration, as well as total energies of a wheel  cart system, as well as rotations around an axis. I have an hour to study in the morning and I'm wondering what I should look at the most to understand the equations. If the book is helpful, where in the book should I look? Thanks in advance, I'll be on later to thank individuals. <eos> \n","<bos> Why is it that 94% of the students at OSU are involved in a fraternity/sorority? This is coming from a senior in high-school so I don't have much say (or knowledge) about what goes on in your fraternities (or a fraternity in general). Is this something you signed up for because practically \"everyone's doing it\"? Or is there an advantage? Or is it just for fun?

I'm looking to work about 10-12 hours a week. I'd like a job where I can get a little bit of schoolwork done on the side, and I want to avoid food service at all costs.  So does anybody know of some chill places to work on campus that are flexible with schedules? Also if you've held a campus job while going to school, how managable is working with school and extra-ciriculars?  <eos> \n","<bos> I know I have until week 7 to withdraw without permission from the instructor, my question is what are the negative effects of having a W on my transcript?

Apparently both of these places offer eye exams, but do any of you have a recommendation on which one I should go to?

I'm not from the area, so I don't really know any apartment complexes. I also don't know a whole lot of people there, which is why I am asking here. I'm looking for a single apartment, possibly 2 bedroom if need be. Any places I should check out that are near the University? The cheaper the better.  Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Go bucks! ps If you are looking for a roommate to live with as well, feel free to ask and we'll talk! I'm a male, 21 y/o.

It's nice having a car on campus and I don't mind taking a bus there or paying for the pass. However, I can't seem to understand the bus schedule.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that I can take the following buses: - North Express (has limited hours) -West Campus Loop (although I have to go all the way around campus) What busses can I take to Carmack 5 (that is far west campus, NOT the Buckeye lot)?  What is schedule for the bus schedule? Am I able to get a bus later in the evening to head back to campus (like 11 pm)?  I've seen the bus schedule but for some reason it doesn't click with me and I need further explanation. Lol. I know, I'm dumb.  Thanks in advance for any replies   <eos> \n","<bos> So i'm pretty sure I just failed the spec quiz we just took. Would be surprised if I got anything above a 5. I really want to do well in this class and was just seeing if anyone has tips/how they got an A in the class? Spec quizzes just really stress me about!

I'm planning on going into ChemE and plan on taking the these classes in the spring: PHYS 1251, MATH 2153, Chem 2520, and ENGR 1181. I've gotten A's in all my chemistry classes so far, and I got A's in calc 1 and 2. I'm also taking the equivalent of PHYS 1250 this semester, and its not bad at all. Do you guys think this schedule is overload? It's only about 14 credit hours and I am used to taking around 18 hours, but I'm worried that the courses I took at my current university won't compare to the difficulty at tOSU, as I have heard some rather scary things. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone taken it yet? How was it? <eos> \n","<bos> With campus being closed today and tomorrow, I'm not going anywhere.

Recently we've noticed that some users with iPhone 7+ and 8+ are experiencing an issue where the app launches to a white screen and just sits frozen. Unfortunately, we've not been able to recreate this nor do we get any kind of crash report for these instances. The students who have contacted us with this problem aren't in town so I can't plug their phone into our computers to see what's going on. If you have a phone that is experiencing this problem and have a few spare hours before class starts it'd be super helpful if you could contact me at fish.26. I'd love to get this resolved before everyone comes back in a few weeks. <eos> \n","<bos> I just started playing gw2 again, and since I am always in the market for more friends on campus, I was wondering if there were any people also playing gw2. <eos> \n","<bos> I heard that in order to get into medical school, having shadowed a doctor is of upmost importance.

My one roommate and I already signed the lease back in February and the other two have put it off until present day. They're supposed to sign it this Friday but I have a feeling the 4th guy isn't going to show. Anyways, in case he decides he's not going to re-lease or we have to tell him he can't because of the trouble he's caused, we need a potential backup plan. If anyone is interested just let me know via comment or PM. Rent is $370/mo. (water included) House is on 11th really close to High. No smoking inside and No pets. Utilities usually run $80ish in the summer/spring months and $110ish in fall/winter months.  <eos> \n","<bos> I've already checked Buffalo Wild Wing's and they are not showing it on Saturday <eos> \n","<bos> I'm in the union and I have a long walk back home off campus in the rain.

Need a little boost to pack the stadium this Tuesday w/it being Trick or Treat night in most CBus suburbs. Should be an electric atmosphere w/an expanded supporters section selling out in less than 8 hours, and the team's unbeaten in their last 11.  \"We need your help to save the Crew. As you may have heard the Nordecke has sold out for the Playoff game against NYCFC 10/31 @ 8pm. However, the stadium is not sold out despite what you may have seen on social media. Right now, #SaveTheCrew has owned the narrative against Precourt Sports Ventures and MLS through the #SaveTheCrew Rally, the display at ESPN Game Day, and the out pouring of support from Crew fans, and those around the league.  In order to continue to to own the narrative, we can't afford to allow anyone the chance to say \"Columbus won't support this team.\" The pressure has to be on them at all times. We have to fill Mapfre Stadium for the playoff game. You may already have tickets, but if you do not, I implore you to please get playoff tickets at crewunion.com. If you know someone who does not have tickets please share this link with them.  The supporter groups are going to have walking tacos with beer from Endeavor and Land Grant at the tailgate for 21+.  WE'RE NOT DONE YET!!!! Together WE will Save The Crew Thank you.\" savethecrew.com #SaveTheCrew <eos> \n","<bos> Im thinking about doing it and i was wondering if you enjoyed it/ how many hours a week it took up. thanks <eos> \n","<bos> Suppose the university organized volunteers to shovel the sidewalks of the neighborhoods adjoining campus, and transported shovels and salt to the street being shoveled, and then onto the next street, and so on. Would you participate? Would you participate if it meant waking up at 6:00 AM or 7:00 AM?  What would prevent you from participating (apathy, not my neighborhood, lack of suitable clothing)? What would be suitable boundaries for the area?  I think there are plenty (students, faculty, and staff) who would volunteer if we have the same weather next year if it was organized the right way.   <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, I'm looking to live in Columbus this summer, and I'm trying to sublet from someone. I have a (highly probable) internship this summer in Columbus. I'm hoping to sublet and save some money as opposed to living in a dorm on campus. I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I'm a pretty quiet person in general. You probably won't see too much of me. I like to keep things clean and orderly. So yeah, just let me know if you're interested in having another roommate over the summer. Guys, thank you all for the responses. Figured it's faster to say it here, but a problem came up very suddenly and I won't be able to the summer internship.

My reasoning for this is so I only need one additional direct elective credit and I can get an internship over the summer without delaying my graduation.

My question is, because I originally thought 8 hrs was the full time minimum, I signed up for ten hours and should my tuition be lower as result?

I'm a 23 y/o veteran aka non-traditional freshman and was thinking of living on campus. I did a few searches about the upperclass/graduate housing and couldn't find anything on the Neil Ave Building.

I pretty much live at the SEL at the moment, and honestly this past semester I've never felt there. It always feels like my body is on auto pilot the entire day, walk up drive to school go to class do homework plan etc, it's an endless routine but im never there, my mind is like turned off and body is just performing these tasks. I don't feel alive, I don't feel like Im ever experiencing anything I don't feel creative or any emotion at all, just an endless routine where my mind if turned off, and my body is just operating on my college schedule, I literally don't feel alive, it feels like nothing is real anymore.. I'm probably not making any sense, anyone feel the same or am I just going crazy? <eos> \n","<bos> First off you have to show up for class for this one.  The course is Yiddish 2367 I think you can also find it as Jewish studies 2367 but I'm not sure about that. You do write in the class but most of it is in class. The one paper we had to write outside of class was a revised version of an in class essay. Most homework comes in the form of write a paragraph about some assigned topic or watch or read something. There is an 8 page final paper but that go cancelled for us. On top of that the instructor is really great and enthusiastic about the subject material. Not sure if there are multiple professors but if there are look for Geoffrey Algar. I highly recommend this course. <eos> \n","<bos> You were the first bus driver to ever cart me around after I transferred to OSU. I was used to quaint little colleges where everyone walked and there were no buses. I remarked that your driving was comparable to being on safari, and people sitting around me laughed. The next week I awkwardly caught a kid who otherwise would have landed on his butt thanks to your unexpected quick stops. Once, I was stupidly trying to do homework while standing, and I fell into a random guy's lap when you quick-stopped at a light.  But you know what? I've learned to appreciate your driving style. You've waited for me numerous times as I sprinted across the commuter parking lot trying to catch the bus, and I swear you even smiled at me once after I breathlessly thanked you. When I'm waiting on the curb and I see you driving the next bus to Academic Core, I smile a little because I know I won't be late for my morning class. I know if there was ever any funny business going on in your bus, you'd put a stop to it faster than any of those other scrawny boy drivers. You're professional, quick, and you give off definite badass vibes.  So I salute you, Mr. Bald Bus Driver. May you always enjoy your job, and may the pedestrians always cross quickly out of your way!  <eos> \n","<bos> I am currently wrapping up a BS in Psych with a minor in Legal Foundations. I came in with a good amount of credit, so I'd be done after 2.5 years. Grad school is in my future obviously, but I have been thinking about what I want to do and more undergrad education is an option. Adding another bachelor's, likely in Special Education, has my interest, but that requires a dual degree instead of just double-majoring. Does anyone have experience with dual degrees? They say no overlap with the GEs between colleges, but I know there are exceptions. Is it a huge pain in the ass? Could I pull it off in another 3 semesters? Any advice from EHE students about programs? I do plan on talking to my advisor when I'm back on campus, but thank you for any input!! <eos> \n","<bos> So for the first two years you have to live on-campus.

Currently, my top choices are Business and Entrepreneurship  Innovation.  For context: I hope to someday work in new product development or something similar. I want my minor to help me with that. From what I've read, the Entrepreneurship  Innovation classes are more suited to my interests, but I also fear they may be too similar to my engineering classes to give me a solid knowledge of the business side of things. I'm also not sure which minor holds more weight: is a Business minor slightly more impressive than an Entrepreneurship  Innovation minor? Or vice versa? Or are they pretty equal? I know it's just a minor, but I want to make the right decision.

I've noticed that in Physics, Fundamentals of Engineering Class, and maybe somewhat of my Calculus 1 class, that it's a lot more difficult for me to understand mathematical and scientific things than it is for others. It's really difficult for me to understand equations at times and how to convert word problems into the appropriate equation. If these types of situations start coming into play with computer science/programming, then I'm worried that maybe I'm not right for this major.  My ACT score was quite a bit higher than the average ACT score for the rest of the freshman class, which I know isn't an definite indicator for success or intelligence, but ideally, I should be doing just as well as other students and I'm not. I dedicate a significant amount of time to academics also, so I know that I'm not skimping out on that. I study, pay attention in class, do my homework, take notes, etc.  So all I'm left with is that I simply don't think the right way that someone heading into this major should. I have never felt so academically challenged and so \"behind\" as I have the last 1-2 weeks.  So I guess what I'm asking is if I should be worried that I'm struggling with these prerequisites, or do I not have to worry about them once I start getting deeper into my major-focused classes? Any advice and feedback is much appreciated, thank you.  <eos> \n","<bos> Just wondering if anyone who took these can say if they needed the textbook/how much they used it.

I'm not entirely sure what I want to do, but as of now I'm thinking of ChemE. Well, I have anxiety problems (take prozac and occasional xanax), mainly towards: transitions in life, change, public speaking, meeting people for the first time. Other than this, I'm pretty sociable and fine. I'm just very worried if someone like me will be able to succeed in engineering, specifically the program OSU has. The FE sequence sounds like death (apparently there are lots of presentations) and that class' environment just gives me tons of anxiety. I'm the kind of person who'd just love to sit back and be a head in the crowd during a class, but I feel like FE and perhaps other engineering classes are very active. Anyone here want to give me some peace of mind or the cold truth? Any other engineers who dealt with anxiety share some advice? <eos> \n","<bos> Hey everyone, I will currently be a sophomore this fall and am looking into transferring.

Which programming language would be best to learn (which one do CSE majors at OSU use the most)? I was thinking C++ since the intro to programming class is in C++, but I'm not sure. 2. Which topics come up a lot throughout classes that I should self study/ read into as a high schooler?  3. Adding on to question 1.. Would Python be a useful language to learn (not asking about in general, asking in regards to how often it could be/ is used at Ohio State)?

But if you don't know what incident I'm talking about here's the link: [url link] .Believe it or not, the car has been there since Tuesday morning even I've seen it before the post.  Here's the story: I was on my way back to my car parked in the same spot (C lot St. John Arena), and I noticed that the car was in the same spot. When I got closer to it, I saw the owner and his friend, trying to free the car but failed. Eventually, the owner is a classmate of mine. He asked me to drive them to his friend's car on West Campus parking lot, so I helped them. During our way to the West Campus, I asked him why he would park his car on ice. He told me that he was late for his morning capstone class and he decided to park on THAT SPOT since there were no other spot left (THANKS A LOT CAMPUS PARC). He also mentioned that he'll try to get his car towed by tomorrow. As u/osuNUB321 said \"sometimes you just gotta get to class\" I know some of you may not believe this story but I wrote it based on the conversation with the owner of the car TL;DR : almost late for class, no time to find parking spot so he decided to park on THAT SPOT.

I just got off the phone with the police and the best way they can take action is if POLICE REPORTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING FILED. That way they have a reason to send in plain clothes officers to arrest and apprehend. I would also urge you to CALL THEM! That way they see this is an issue and arrest these people. It only takes a few minutes and you can do it online. Edit: Also encourage anyone you know whose experienced theft to file one. <eos> \n","<bos> hey guys, quick question - I am a math major that is interested in learning more about different softwares.

I am on the borderline, so I need to maximize my chances of getting it. I submitted my ACT score of 29 (no writing). The only time I took writing was on my first new SAT which I scored 1220. Obviously this is significantly lower than the scholarship requirements. I took another new SAT without writing and scored a 1320, still not good enough for a scholarship. Based on members advice on here I only sent my ACT score. My question now (very last minute) is does OSU require a writing score? If so, that would require me to send my 1220 and then my 1320 as well to make me not look like a moron, correct? I really didn't plan on sending these scores, but I'm going to have to if they want the writing. <eos> \n","<bos> has anyone heard back about their application to CBE?  <eos> \n","<bos> What was the process like?

I'm a rising sophomore who's enrolled in STEP next semester. Preferably, I'd like to use those funds to help pay for some kind of excursion out of the country, pretty typical. However, STEP says that for \"student safety\", the $2000 can only be used internationally for OSU-managed programs.

Participants will be asked to complete assessments to allow evaluation of the short- and longer-term effectiveness of this intervention. The study is designed to provide high quality clinical care, free of cost, to all study participants enrolled in the study and to improve treatment of depression for others in the future. **What are the symptoms of depression?** • Mood changes reflected by feeling low, gloomy, sad, blue, irritable, or crying more easily than usual • Loss of interest or enjoyment in things that used to be enjoyable, such as spending time with others, hobbies, sports, or work • Appetite and/or weight changes • Changes in sleep patterns • Feeling tired, slowed down, or lacking energy • Self-criticism, feeling guilty, or feelings of worthlessness • Difficulty making decisions, concentrating, or thinking clearly • Thoughts of death or harming yourself **Who is the Depression Treatment Study for?** We are recruiting adults ages 18+ for participation in the Depression Treatment Study. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression and are 18 years of age or older, you may qualify for the study. **What does it cost to participate in the Depression Treatment Study?** There is no charge for any of the evaluations or treatment associated with the study. **How long does the study last?** The study consists of 16 weeks of individual therapy. Additionally, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about once a month for one year after your treatment. **How do I get into the study?** Call **(614) 688-0968** to get more information about the study and complete an initial phone screening. If you do not qualify for the study (or would like treatment not provided in the study), study personnel can discuss other sources of treatment that might be appropriate for you. <eos> \n","<bos> Sup, We're two cool dudes looking for another cool dude to come chill in our party mansion with us.

Is it just that, it's really easy to fall behind, and the class covers a wide span of deep material? What are the labs like? Would anyone care to share some insights from their experience?

As you may know, housing applications have opened back up for current students. I currently live on campus, but my family lives well within the 25 mile limit in order to commute. I am strongly considering commuting, as I'd be saving around $11700 next year by commuting instead of living on campus again. While this is a huge amount of money to be saved, I still am afraid that I'd regret it. Any current commuters, or people who chose to not live in the dorms second semester and chose to commute instead, who could share their experiences would be greatly appreciated, thank you! <eos> \n","<bos> I have my thermostat set to 69° but my room STAYS above 74°.

Last year, maintenance requests would be fulfilled same day or next day. This school year, however, has been awful for this. Our kitchen sink has been broken for almost a full week, and as such, the wood under the sink is rotting due to the leakage. The landlords do not give a single fuck and would rather their property be destroyed. I've sent in multiple requests to repair our toilet and dish washer, both of which are ignored. Is this experience unique to me, or are other leasers experiencing the same? If so, perhaps there is action we can take together to get their attention. <eos> \n","<bos> I am starting Graduate studies in OChem and during training we are going to be given the ACS GenChem and OChem exams. I have never heard of these tests before, and though I have done the best I can reviewing the material, it's been two years since my last OChem course. It was told to us that the exams are for \"advisory\" purposes, but what exactly are we taking them for? Will the scores decide which courses we TA or how many credits we will be allowed to pursue? <eos> \n","<bos> Just received my acceptance letter, and now it's time to think about housing. I'm a guy whose going into engineering. Few questions 1. I've heard rooming with your close friends is a bad idea, but a few of my best friends are also coming here so we've thought about rooming. Why is it a bad idea to room with your highschool friends? Would it be bad if we got a 4 person room all together? 2. Besides highschool friends, is it a bad idea to get a 4-6 room freshman year with random people? Good idea? Is a 2 room the best option? 3. Talk to me about some of the housing on north campus (pretty much where I'll have to live). Where should I aim to live? Which north dorms are the best? I've been thinking about Blackburn and Scott. Thanks a lot  <eos> \n","<bos> I just saw I was assigned my professor for math 1172 for next semester and his rating is a 2.1 on ratemyprofessor and it seems like people hate him.

I'm registering for classes tomorrow and unfortunately did not take biology my freshman year. I also did not take AP Bio in high school because I wanted to take a molgen and anatomy class instead. I feel like I need to get my core classes out of the way for junior year when I'm taking biochem, physiology, and microbiology classes. My advisor said that they generally don't recommend taking ochem and physics at the same time, but that it's \"doable.\" My main concern was having three classes with lab, but my friends say that the physics labs aren't as detailed as the chem ones I'm currently doing. For reference, I'm considering taking Bio 1113H, Physics 1250H (have credit for 1200 through AP), and non-honors Ochem 2510. Is honors bio and physics much more difficult than regular? I took Chem 1910H and got a B, so I dropped to 1220 and consistently get 7-10% above the average on midterms. <eos> \n","<bos> I'll be in OSU's humanities scholars program in Autumn of 2012, and I'll be living in Haverfield House.

I'll also have enough credits to be a sophomore or possibly a junior. If I wanted to rush, would this hurt my chances of getting into a fraternity?

I can't carry this kind of thing all the way from Europe, so I was hoping on buying it when I get there. I'll be living on campus, so at least I'll have furniture!

In just over a month's time, we (along with our collaborator's in **MUNDO** and the **Collegiate Council on World Affairs**) will be running the mega-game known as Watch the Skies. The event will take place Saturday, April 15th, from 2:00 PM to 10:00 PM in the Ohio Union. A mega-game is a game in which a large group of players (typically 30+) play at the same time and interact with each other over the course of the game. Watch the Skies puts the players in the shoes of world leaders or alien visitors during a time of alien contact with Earth. Players will need to be diplomatic and creative to tackle the challenges and crises laid before them over the course of the game; building allies with other nations, maneuvering their forces to handle threats, and allocating their resources wisely are all some things that each team as a nation will have to work together to accomplish.  This is a massive endeavor on the co-ordination end, and we are looking to reach out the the OSU community to bolster the number of players to help run the game as \"Control.\" Persons in the role of Control will help make sure everything runs smoothly and effectively on the day of the event. In return, your participation in the event and complimentary food-stuffs will come free of charge. Sign-ups for players are coming soon^(tm); but at the moment, we are just looking for those interested in helping **run the game.** You can find out more about our specific event and sign-up [here]([url link] If you'd like to see what Watch the Skies is all about, we highly recommend checking out Shut Up  Sit Down's video on their play-through of the game [here]([url link] <eos> \n","<bos> Hello fellow OSU classmates!

Even just general info about the bags would be helpful, the thickness and dimensions that they use, where they source them from, anything that could help me to get ones that are near-identical. <eos> \n","<bos> How strict of a policy do the dorms enforce when it comes to candles and incense in dorm rooms?

Well because I've missed one of my Midterms and before I was due to resit the paper, they flashed the questions  answers for majority of students who have already completed it. I then took pictures of the script discreetly in hope that it would serve as a study guide for my paper. (I had no idea that they would reuse the questions)  To cut the story short - I prepped and went ahead for the make-up paper, only to have these \"notes\" discovered by the TA. (I know I was really foolish in printing them, bringing these along for the exam, and was unfortunate that the TA spotted it when I was putting them away for a sec.) I'm really afraid of getting an academic misconduct record, or failing the test/course due to this.. The TA reported her sightings to Burgoon and they've confiscated those \"notes\" and said they'll report me to the discipline committee accordingly. An ideas on what should I expect or what could I do to alleviate this situation? I'm contemplating writing an email to Burgoon and TA explaining my actions.  <eos> \n","<bos> I found his buck ID and driver's license in the parking lot by the convention center.

Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a pre-med Biology major, and I came in with credit for Calc I so I avoided it 1st semester. Come 2nd semester though, I was goaded into taking Calc II, and so I had to re-learn a lot of forgotten concepts. I studied hard, did all the practice problems, Unfortunately, I was too late, and I got a 65 on the first midterm. I need to stop this before it gets worse, so I have to ask: those who did well in Calc II, how did you do it?  P.S.(Just to let you know, I'm also in the flipped online classroom version of the course)    P  <eos> \n","<bos> Little vent and warning to anyone planning to commute. 1. My first semester at OSU was spent half aware, because my high school was minuscule in comparison. A result of this was that I consistently parked in a staff spot. Had no clue. I never saw the signs and I was never told about them. I thought a west campus parking pass meant I could park at the west campus lot. Silly me. I eventually got a $60 citation. I emailed about it and got a few frustrating replies even though I explained the situation. I was new! I actually was accidentally double fined, so at least it was knocked down to $30. 2. Yesterday, the freaking day of my Summer class' exam, I was fined $60, because someone decided the permits should expire right before exam week, while everyone has much more to worry about. 3. My boss, who works in one of the departments at OSU, was cited for entering a garage while the arm was up. She has a pass, but the arm was up and she needed to park. She had a freaking pass and explained things to the guy who gave her the citation. The worst of it was that Campusparc put a hold on her **daughter's** account. Her daughter, who had nothing to do with the citation, was prevented from scheduling classes until the citation was settled. I'm not the best story-teller, but I felt this was worth sharing. I hate Campusparc.  <eos> \n","<bos> I've seen a lot of posts recently about how hard these classes have become. Is it possible to get an A in both of them?

Street sweeping occurs from April to November on various days through the month, most commonly during the 2nd week of the Month. I know one that I regularly park on is on Fridays, 8am-4pm.  If you're parked on the street when they come to sweep THEY WILL TOW. And it's the city that tows, not Shamrock, so you will have to pay ~$190. I'm currently working on mapping out all of the parking restrictions, but be alert! <eos> \n","<bos> I completely forgot they start stripping the garage tomorrow and my car is still in lane ave garage.

I'm going to take Organic Chemistry 1 and Neuro3000 and was planning on taking either stats2480 or french. For those who took it, was NEURO3000 super hard like I've \"heard\" (Honestly, I've heard at least one person claim every class is difficult here but this one I kind of believe) or was it in league with psych 3313 in terms of study time and difficulty? Do you think orgo, Psych and Neuroscience3000 together would be SUPER hard? I know orgo is really hard, but if I was taking the equivalent of 2 psych 3313's with it, I could do one more class that requires studying (stats). So my real question is whether it's worth trying to take stats with the other three?  <eos> \n","<bos> Any advice on this stuff? shit boring af. <eos> \n","<bos> I saw this on r/cfb about the UCLA/USC game and thought it was a cool idea. I've put forward the idea on the Michigan subreddit and am now presenting it to you. If we win The Game, we as a sub get to pick your sidebar pic that you put up for a week, and vice versa. Obviously no vulgar or offensive photos. What do you guys think? Edit: What this thread should be is people either arguing why we should/shouldn't make this wager, and people posting ideas for pictures for the other sub should your team win. Edit 2: I messaged one your mods with the idea, and will message the mod over at r/uofm. I think you guys should start looking for pics, unless some of you wanted to wait until The Game is over and use one from it. <eos> \n","<bos> I play a lot of games and I kinda just wanna play with people that I can talk to <eos> \n","<bos> I am taking a couple courses over the summer and I want to find the list of the students in the class in hopes that I can email them all google docs links to share with each other say for midterm study guides and what not.

It sat there for about an hour so I brought it inside the store. If anyone lost a bike tonight message me. It'll be chilling at my house for now. Edit: No i did not steal the bike.

This isn't because I'm some genius or anything either, lots of other people are way smarter than me.  I'm going into the engineering program next year, and I'm wondering if this is one of those things that people over exaggerate the difficulty in. Are there any engineers in here that can give their opinion on how difficult freshman engineering is? Will I not be able to be involved in extracurriculars, and not be able to go out on the weekends? Why is it difficult? Can you give an example of a stressful/ hard time you faced in the freshman engineering? What's the typical day like? I'm just trying to get the true picture, since I'm worried I won't be able to do anything else besides study.

He just went back home for the summer and he took the bike with him. I've taken the Cota before, but it can be a hassle sometimes. Having a bike is so much more convenient because I can go whenever and wherever I want. I have tried my old mountain bike but it is terrible. Where can I find a decent road bike that's in good condition for under 60 bucks? I know at the end of each year, people try to get rid of some of their things. Do you guys know anyone who doesn't want their road bike anymore?

I went and looked around, but couldn’t find anything. Anybody know where/what time tutoring is? <eos> \n","<bos> I just transferred over here this semester, and started off by taking Math 1151 (Calculus 1), Physics 1250 (the calculus based physics), ENGR 1181, and another 1 credit hour course. I had to drop Physics 1250, and that took a huge workload off, but even with Calculus being my main focus, I just got a 77% on my second midterm (61% on my first one). I've been putting a ton of effort into this class, and its demotivating when I work my ass off with little return. So needless to say, my first semester here has not been very fun. So my question is: can I expect the entire CS degree to be as difficult as classes like Calculus 1 and Physics 1250? Because right now, I feel like I'm putting in the effort necessary, but not getting the grades I want, and it's really stressing me out. I've heard that Calculus and physics will probably be the hardest classes I'll take at the university, but I'm not sure if that's true or not. tl;dr Working hard in Calculus 1 and had to drop physics 1250, getting little return for the effort, wondering if I'll struggle as much throughout the degree as I have with these classes. <eos> \n","<bos> Seriously, next time look in Thompson on the south side of the first floor. they have tons of movies, and TV series (literally all of seinfeld, and simpsons).

It had me listed as a non-Ohio resident. Naturally I contacted OSU to fix this. I was told it was a result of me selecting 'other' on the form that asks who you're dependent on. The problem is I am still dependent on my parents. I accidentally selected 'other' thinking everything was alright. I went through the process of amending the residency and I got to the point that asks for my parents address. Now I'm concerned because I don't live with my parents, I have a buddy I'm staying with. It's been this way for a few years now. Will I be considered an out of stater (or not dependent on my parents) due to living w/ a roommate elsewhere? It threw me off because Columbus State never seemed to care about this. I still paid the in-state cost for my years there. Maybe I'm overthinking this and things will be fine. But I'm not sure how this works and would *really* appreciate some kind words on the matter. Thanks for reading, everyone.  **Edit:** Appreciate the help everyone! An OSU rep notified me that after correcting a few things I should indeed be fine.

I'm an incoming freshman to honors engineering who tries to eat healthy, and I've been looking at the highly popular new dining plans to decide which one is best, but in the process of trying to find out which one is most economically sound, I seem to have found that the food options themselves aren't really all that healthy. Is this true, or are there ways for a dilligent eater to be healthy if they want to be? I expected there to be a large amount of junk food to choose from, but I naïvely assumed that there would be a sizeable amount of healthy food to chooose from as well since OSU is so big on athletics. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't REQUIRED that everyone living in a residence hall opt into one of the food plans, but alas that is not so.  I live in Columbus, so I could avoid living in a dorm (and thus the meal plans) if I wanted to, but I want to live in one to help initiate myself into the OSU community since I am a pretty quiet guy and to leave home. So what say? Is it realistic for a freshman at OSU to eat well through the dining plans (no Freshman Fifteen), and if so, how? Any help is appreciated, thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> Any tips on surviving babic and supowit? I really want to do well and get a lot out of the courses.

My adviser (Samantha Reed) suggested that even if I don't get in for sure I should show up to the first class of the week and get my name put on a list and talk to the instructor.

There was only one car that was heading south bound on High and the blue suv was slowing down because the light just turned red, so i started heading across the road. I was starting using the cross walk and decided to cut the corner and went behind the blue suv, where at no point was i more then 10 feet away from the crosswalk. As soon as i hit the side walk headed for the bus stop in between Arps and Stillman Hall, two bike police called for me so i went over to see if anything was happening that i wasnt aware of. So i told them that i had to go where i had to go and didnt see that i wasnt in danager at any point. So they made me take my backpack off and get out my id. I didnt have my drivers license because if i was going to get robbed i didnt want to lose anything super important, so i gave the two police officers my buckid which they yelled at me for not having my id. Then they told me to sit down being drunk with power which i thought was humiliating. After asking for my address which i gave multiple times, the one office yelled at me for not knowing my address which i also found humilating because multiple people keep watching as the walked by. After a lecturing on hearing about the people getting hit by cars, they gave me a ticket which the warned was going to cost around $100.

I'm trying to drop another class but I don't feel comfortable doing so until I know that my Econ class fits the requirements. **Edit:** Thanks guys! <eos> \n","<bos> I, like many other students it seems, will be graduating in December. Not this school year, but next school year. Still, I want to plan ahead.  It seems like the number of people graduating in December plus those doing spring co-ops/study abroad is far greater than the number of people who need an apartment just for spring. Is this true?  My current apartment has is pretty great (cheap, close, nice landlord, laundry in the basement, off-street parking) but I really don't want to risk not being able to find someone to sublease and then having to pay for the whole year.  Would it be smarter to just live in a dorm for that last semester? (The only thing that puts me off living in a dorm is a) not having a full kitchen and b) having to pay for a campus parking pass).  <eos> \n","<bos> I'm assuming I put my form in the right place in Scott Lab.

Does anyone know how flexible that is? My friend couldn't get some issues with his DARS report straightened out before the deadline, but should otherwise be able to graduate this spring. Could he turn in an app late and still walk? Or is all hope lost and he'll have to wait til Summer commencement? Any insight is greatly appreciated! :) <eos> \n","<bos> I'm looking at an advertisement for this class on the bus and thought it might be interesting.

Right now it's me, a guy, and two friends, one guy (he's not 100% if he's living there) and one girl. We're not picky haha guys or girls work. We're all pretty laid back, we do like to have a good time and will more than likely have a few tailgates or parties, but it won't be a weekly thing.  There's some pictures on this website, but not all the information is up to date.

During my senior year, I took AP Calc AB and AP Physics C and to my understanding MATH 1151 and PHYSICS 1250 are pretty similar with those courses so the content shouldn't be a shock to me I just need to adjust to the class being only a semester long and not being able to use calculators in exams for Calc 1. Still, AP Physics C was pretty hard and I don't expect to earn credit for PHYSICS 1250. Should I keep some study materials and review books I had for the AP exams to help me with those 2 classes? Lastly, which classes do I actually need a physical copy of the textbook? And how often is it used in the class? <eos> \n","<bos> can anyone give me some feedback on companies such as home team properties, university village, buckeye real estate etc?

I bought reserved B10 season tickets. How do the seating groups work? Is there a FB page for meeting other first years and setting up groups?

My parents are coming with, so I'm trying to convince them to let me go to Ohio State rather than a smaller university in my state.

That summer I took a second session online GPA booster class to help in the long run raising my GPA. I'm not doing much this summer and was thinkingI might as well try to raise my GPA more while I'm still home this summer, too. Does anyone have any suggestions? I took ESEPSY 1159 last summer. <eos> \n","<bos> Carson a Greco was the name on it and I handed it to lost and found in central service building.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey Guys, My student org, ImpactOSU, has recently restructured to handle more demand from student organizations. We provide marketing/fundraising/design/strategy services for other student orgs on campus. Basically we operate like a firm: you get free stuff, our members get experience. We've done stuff for TFL, Block \"O\", Women's Glee, etc. If that sounds like something your org could use (or you'd like to get involved with us), you can check out [how it works]([url link] We currently have 12 open spots (three for each major category of service). We're limiting how much demand we can take this semester, so spots will probably fill up quickly. <eos> \n","<bos> I took 1172 last semester, and I was using grade forgiveness to pad my grade and enter my major. Needless to say I feel like a piece of shit who shouldn't have ever been to college in the first place. I really enjoy math but I do terrible in time constrained tests. I got a 35 percent on my first midterm and I'm planning on taking a W and drop it. So should I just change my major, I think if I can't pass 1172, nothing is even worth it.I'm in terrible depression, all my other classes have A's and B's, in fact I even got a good grade in 1151, but I just can't seem to get past 1172. If I drop it, I know ill keep this unending cycle of taking and dropping it. I know this sounds stupid but I've been thinking to stick it with whatever grade I get, as long as I pass. But that would make it impossible for me to enter my major this semester. Should I just waste another grade forgiveness on this class probably? Also if its possible , how would I go about taking this class at C-state? <eos> \n","<bos> Can anyone tell me how the rooms are in the Towers?

The University loves to flaunt the \"10 free counseling appointments\" every student receives, but they fail to mention that it's *extremely hard* to even get a first appointment. My fraternity started Mental Health Matters week two years ago, and this year we've partnered with nearly all other fraternities and sororities on campus to make as much of an impact on the mental health scene as possible. While Reddit is [obviously] not the biggest fan of Greek Life, often for good reason, I'm sure we all can agree that a dedicated group of 6,000 individuals has the potential to change things significantly for the better. The University hasn't done anything, and is still reluctant to do anything, so we've decided to take it into our own hands. We've partnered with the Student Wellness Center, Lulu Lemon, multiple bars around campus, and a host of other organizations to make this as impactful as possible. Even U of M has expressed interest in implementing a program based on what we are doing. In most mentally unhealthy situations, the individual simply needs someone else to ask them the right questions. Our plan, approved by the University, is to provide training ( certification) to many more peer-to-peer counselors and to develop systems that will allow for *immediate*, certified, assistance while also allowing for long-term help afterward. I'd love for anybody that is willing to donate a few dollars, but as poor college students I realize that may be asking too much. If mental health is important to you, though, and you'd be able to simply share our purpose and the link to our GoFundMe, it would be immensely appreciated. The state of mental health on college campuses is abysmal, but we really want to change it for the better. Feel free to ask any questions about our plans and I'll answer as best as I can. Hope you all have a great week!

I'm interested in getting into Network engineering, and I'm a pretty average student. -is there a GPA above 3.0 that Fisher looks for in MIS applicants? -how can I make sure I get into Fisher??

I've read that 1172 is really hard and I got a solid B in Calculus I (but at a pretty equivalent institution) and I need a 3.0 maintained by the end of my second year to keep my scholarship (which is pretty necessary for me to continue going to college since I'm poor). Is it possible to get a solid B or higher in math 1172 on top of everything else? If my GPA gets a little bit below 3.0 I won't be too worried because I have time to make it up but if it gets too low I'm screwed. I had a 3.8 from my dual enrollment but transferring to OSU essentially erased that GPA so I have none of my first year classes padding my GPA.  <eos> \n","<bos> So I got put into a section with Bach and from what I read on here as well as Rate my professor, RIP me.

I have no plan on doing it next year, but if I figure some shit out I'm considering it for my final year. I did learn a lot of the material and studied well but I made some stupid mistakes on midterms which cost me a lot considering how these courses are midterm only classes. Obviously it's my fault and my responsibility but I know I know my shit when it comes to these classes and I still have to and want to prove myself.  I know you have to petition it from the grad school and also get professor permission. I don't plan on asking my advisor just yet because it's something I'd rather discuss in person not email and I can't get an appointment for a while anyway. I'm just looking to see what other undergrads did.  Do you normally have to come up with a bunch of reasons to take the class? Was an approved petition hard to get or is it just something simple the admins sign off on? Did the professors ask why you wanted the class or ask to see your grades or anything? Were you ever rejected, and if so why? And what were your courses like compared to undergrad?  Idc if you took STEM or humanities grad courses, I'm really looking for just info from everyone. If you took upper lvl CS/Bio classes I'd really be interested to hear those too. Thanks <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a Cincy native living in South Florida.

I was going through severe depression at the time, and that was the main cause. I was never written up at all, and never even drank. Last week, my roommates started drinking, and I had some, and we got written up by our ra. I have improved significantly in my classes this year(looking at above a3.5 for the semester) and this is my first time getting written up, but I am worried about getting kicked out since I am on probation. :( <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone had a good experience with them?

But HOLY SHIT. Did this year go by soooo fast. For some reason this year was the fastest school year in my life so far. I think it has to do with the amount of work I've done this year compared to previous years. This weather should be cheering me up and everything, but it made me realize that it just became warm in the last 3 weeks of school. Like wtf hahaha. Im generally a happy person but this has been making me feel some sort of down in a way like life needs to slow the fuck down. Looking back from when I got here so this year being almost over, it sucks knowing I should've done more. Sorry if this sounds like Im ranting but im not. I think were so invested in schoolwork and getting A's (I know it pays off in the future), that we often forget to actually live life and cherish these moments because college only happens once. Sorry if this offends anyone in any way, I wasnt intending it to be that way. Just putting it out there to anyone who feels the same way :) I cant even begin to imagine what its like for chem/engineering, etc majors and how worse they might feel compared to me. Keep your heads up and end the year strong! Good luck y'all <eos> \n","<bos> Hello, So, I have over 30 credits from Akron that I earned in High School, and while they all transferred, some of the requirements came up short. For instance, I'll have all of my general chemistry completed, but while at Akron Gen Chem totals to 9 credits, OSU it totals to 10. Still, it's transferable. Do I need that extra credit? I've emailed advisers but I've received no reply, so any experience here? <eos> \n","<bos> Also if we've paid our fees, can we start using it even though the semester hasn't started yet? <eos> \n","<bos> Sorry to do this but I'm exhausting all my options! Subleasing a room from our 4 bedroom 2 bath apartment. 3 girls, looking for another girl. It's townhouse style, so 2 bed, 1 bath in basement, living/kitchen on main, and 2 bed 1 bath upstairs. Upstairs bedroom for sublet. Really great size (I have a full size bed, big dresser, desk, bookshelves, and more in here and I still have the floorspace to do P90X). Pretty decent sized closet. I can leave some of the furniture if you don't want to move your stuff in. Rent is $550/month with everything included (even internet and cable). Security deposit required but we don't have parties or anything here so we should be getting most if not all of it back. No pets allowed. I have a parking pass I will give you! The apartment is really nice. Brand new dishwasher and fridge that we just got like a month ago (ours broke and they were replaced within hours of the maintenance request). Front load washer/dryer in the kitchen, super nice and convenient. The landlord and the maintenance guys are awesome and I've never experienced more professional people before. I would love to stay for the summer, but I really need to start saving my money for post-college expenses and my mom lives 15 minutes from here so it makes sense just to live at home for 3 months. If you have any questions, or want pictures, or want to know more about the girls that will be here during the summer, just PM me! I know $550 seems like a lot but compared to what the quality of some other campus apartments are for only $150 less, it's a no brainer. Let me know if you're interested!

I was in the Honors Collegium for 2 years before being kicked out for supposedly not doing enough. Ironically it seems almost every engineering student who started in the program was also kicked out because lo and behold, our curriculum didn’t allow room for triple majoring in basket weaving for peace or saving a small country in our spare time.  I got into two excellent grad school programs just fine without the help of the Collegium. DO NOT let them pressure you into doing more more more. They try to fast track you into grad school the minute you land in undergrad. This is not ok or normal. So if you’re thinking of applying, carefully consider whether it’s worth your time and energy. If you’ve had a great experience in the program, more power to you. And if you feel stuck in the program, take my advice and drop it - you will be much more successful when you don’t have to listen to others dictate what you will and won’t do with your scholarly time. <eos> \n","<bos> Just curious for now. SKOL <eos> \n","<bos> A little background, I am graduating after the Autumn 2014 semester (which I guess will make me a 5th year senior for just a few months). I'm taking all of my classes in the evenings and the start times are either 3:55 (Tuesday), 4:10 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), or 5:30 (Thursday). I heard that anyone can park on central campus who has any kind of permit after 4pm. I figured I would be parking there between 3:35 and 3:50 and was wondering if it would be safe to just buy the WC permit and park on central campus. My friend who just graduated said he parked in B spots on central campus at 3:30 regularly with no issues. He also said even if I do get a citation, the appeal process is easy and understanding. However, I would like some more opinions on both of these. As a secondary question, since I only need a permit for one semester instead of an entire school year, I heard you can return the permit to 160 Bevis Hall when you no longer need it. Does anyone have any experience with this and is it an easy process? I would be returning it in December, which would leave 7 months of the permit unused. Would I receive a refund equivalent to this amount? Thanks for all your help! <eos> \n","<bos> I know similar questions have been asked in the past, but I still wasn't able to find much pertinent info toward what I'm looking for. My \"special friend\" ;) from home is coming to visit this weekend and I'm trying to find her a place to park.

Nothing is set in stone, but just wondering about potential housing options. I know a lot of people move off campus after their freshman year. My best friend already has an apartment for next year off campus as well. However, due to me possibly transferring and not knowing a ton of people here, I've been thinking maybe it would be a good idea to dorm my sophomore year here.

Well, here's the issue: I noticed after I made my purchase that they're student tickets. I'm not a student and the disclosure states that I will need to present an ID on the day of the game. Great. I tried to contact Stubhub to cancel my purchase, but they informed me that they were unable to. They contacted the seller and asked if there was any way to exchange them, to which the seller said no. However, the seller did say that sometimes the school will allow for non-students to occupy the seats as long as they are contacted before hand and explained the situation. My options now are to contact Ohio State and hope they can accommadate my issue or sell my tickets, and if I sell my tickets it HAS to be to a student. What do you think I should do? Should I re-sell the tickets or should I contact OSU and ask? Do you think they'll be merciful and help out? Any wisdom is appreciated. <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys.

Obviously I'll ask someone who's involved in the whole process what I should do about documentation, but has anyone else had to go through this for simple reasons like you changed your major so you're not going to graduate on time? Did you get SAP status re-instated? I'm really not sure what to expect from all this, and it's a big pain in my ass <eos> \n","<bos> I know this year the hall has been coed from an overnight visit, but it lists [here]([url link] it is single gender?

I was approved for a Stafford loan, I clicked \"accept\" and \"submit\" on the BuckeyeLink site, but it's still not showing up on my statement of account. I've also completed the promissory note and entrance counseling.  This is the first semester I've done this and I'm finding the whole process pretty confusing. If anyone has any insight I'd really appreciate it. Edit: PROBLEM SOLVED - turns out that aid disbursement is triggered by me signing up for enough credits to be a half-time student. I'm still waiting for my college to enroll me in one class, which will get me to half-time status.  I really wish I had known this several weeks ago so I could have enrolled in an extra class, gotten the aid, dropped the extra class, and therefore avoided a $200 late fee.  <eos> \n","<bos> I come to town for work.

But I got two tickets $110 for having parked in the wrong place ( slightly blocked the white slideway) yesterday and today. I was super annoyed because I tried to find a suitable spot really hard yesterday night, I've driven along the street twice to make sure I didn't miss any good spot. But there were sooo many cars that I couldn't find a good one and it was too late in the night, I don't want to hang out outside and drive back for a good spot.  Could somebody offer some wise ideas? I think I'd be poor and couldn't afford my studies in US if I keep getting these unreasonable tickets...

There's a list of some of the programs (all of the programs?) on the website for the honors program, but those don't really include descriptions of any sort, and when I ask my friends who have applied to the honors program they sort of just shrug their shoulders and admit that they also have no idea what it is.

Has anyone switched specializations within fisher? Do you have to reapply to the school/specialization or can you simply transfer IF there is enough room (I.e if it’s not a closed major)? GPA requirements?  Even if i do get into the specialization of my choice, I won’t be able to start the classes until Spring 2019 due to prereqs.  I’ve already messaged my advisor about this but she’s out of the office for another week so I was wondering if anyone here has done something similar.

Pretty bad. So I was thinking I should take a semester of basic ME classes that are easy and than a TON of GEs. I was thinking that if I did that for this spring and summer semester I would have atleast a 3.0.  It's not like I am a bad student. It's just some classes *chough* calc* are just difficult for me. I'm pretty decent in my other classes but I'm looking a max of a 3.3 and that'll just get me a 2.9.

I was thinking about pursuing a BA in Economics becaues I wanted to go into marketing/business but I'm looking towards Fisher too. I'm not sure which will be a better outlook for my future.. I tend to worry a lot and getting a job after graduation is my top priority. Therefore I was wondering what the average GPA is to get in to Fisher. I know a lot of my friends who met the requirements that didn't get into Fisher and I'm not sure if its like Nursing where the majority of students have above a 3.5? I didn't think about Fisher until now because I've heard how hard the college is and how companies won't even look at your resume if your GPA is lower than a 3.0.. Any infromation would be helpful.

I plan on graduating in SP19 (could've done it in SP18 but I extended a year to do an honors program) I have been thinking of doing a double major with Math (gain some technical skill to accompany my finance degree bc Fisher doesn't focus on too much maths) but that would mean extending my grad date to Spring 2020. I'd get an additional summer for an internship and since OSU is paying tuition for students that qualify for Pell Grant it'll be some extra cash for me. Plus I am starting to get involved in some groups  trying for a leadership position that I could continue for an additional year. But I kinda wonder if doing 6 years of college work sounds daunting and it would be an additional year I am at OSU and not out working.  Any opinions? My academic advisors  some faculty I talked with have given me some input but I wanted to hear opinions from other students. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm considering trying to live there next year but it's hard to tell how nice it just by the floor plan online.

I plan on taking a gap year before medical school out of the country, in a situation where I won't be making much money.

Does anyone who has done relatively well with Weinstein have any suggestions at all as to how to survive/not fail with him?? Things that worked for you?

Multiple times a day! It has never been a hassle. At all. Various employee systems have this security measure in check, and it doesn’t feel like a big deal, because it isn’t a big deal.  Students, yes you log into Carmen multiple times a day. I most likely assume you have your smart phone on or near you. It takes 2 seconds to get your push notification and press approve.  Change happens kids. You need to get used to it. I understand sometimes change isn’t always good, and fight the power all you want. But this is not that big of a deal. There are bigger battles to fight on campus. Change can suck or be okay depending on your personal attitude. You will have to face change you may not agree with in all work environments. Think of this as practice for the real world. You will get used to this.  Also, it’s going to be required for etimesheet for any of you students on that system. That goes into effect sept 30. FYI.  This isn’t just an OSU thing either. Many other colleges and companies use this app and security measure. For what it’s worth- I’m a student too who uses Carmen.  <eos> \n","<bos> anyone driving to cedar point tomorrow who has space? <eos> \n","<bos> I just learned about AP credits I have, so I'm dropping Calculus and need to replace it.

One question though, what's the difference between WC and WC5 permits?

Just want to make sure before I renew and then get my car booted. Thanks.  <eos> \n","<bos> I just found out I have Jesse Martin for Physics 1250 this semester.

Any input is appreciated, thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> I was inspired by the fellow the other day who said being an older OSU student sucks because of the difficulty in relating to their younger peers and making friends. I'm hoping this can serve as a way for us older Buckeyes to find friends, support each other with the stresses of being a non-traditional student, and create live meet-ups so we don't have to feel like we're so alone on this big campus. If you're interested in the idea then please feel free to join up. Edit: we've got 10 people so far!

Maybe use a darker color theme at night and dim the tower. Finally, the flashy ads on the tower make it look like a vertical highway billboard. If the clock tower costs so much, why make it look so tacky with the ads? I don't know if this post will make a difference, but I'd like to express that I think the clock tower does have potential to be okayish if osu changes how the screen is used.  P.S. Keep the clock tower memes though, they are fantastic.   <eos> \n","<bos> I'm already a bit loaded for the semester and considering taking this course on top of that.

I really, REALLY want this T shirt: [url link] but can only find it online in Small, Medium, and XXL - I'm a Large. I'm in the military, currently stationed in Louisiana, and I picked up a LSU one when I went and tailgated earlier this year (I know, it's awful, but I was just trying to ingratiate myself with the indigenous population).

Also, how useful is ECS for finding an internship and what benefit does it offer compared to other methods? <eos> \n","<bos> I'm pretty sure that I scratched my rectum with their shitty one ply excuse of toilet paper.

They don't really provide any and I have troubles studying for classes with no textbooks... Thanks in advance. <eos> \n","<bos> Finally decided to stop being a lurker. Well, the title kind of explains my predicament. I'll be a first year this Autumn, and I'm a little nervous. I never had very many friends through high school, and the ones I did have are going to different schools. I'm not much of a party animal... well not at all, if I'm totally honest. I don't want to join a fraternity because I've heard nothing but negative, plus I don't plan on drinking (I know, I sound like a very colorful person). I didn't go out much either. I'm trying out for TBDBITL, and hopefully that will help, but I don't really know how to make friends all too well. For any other introverts/ shy people, how did you get past this? I could really use some advice. What kind of things can I do? What were your experiences like? Am I worrying too much?  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, my living arrangements for next year fell through. If anybody needs an extra room mate please PM me! I'm looking for a place where my share of the rent (before utilities and fees) is no more than $550. I will be driving a car so I need someplace to park as well.  I'm flexible and have no preferences on partying/smoking or whether you are a group of males or females, I just want to get off campus.

If yes, does anyone know what the cost is? I assume most people just buy a jug of laundry detergent and I assume it would have to be High Efficiency detergent right? <eos> \n","<bos> So I normally wouldn't but due to high rent and recent low paychecks, I'm looking to sell my longboard. I tried taking it to a pawn shop but they said they don't buy boards. I've also posted letgo but only one person hit me up and they're wayyyyyy outside Columbus so its not practical. Anyone know of a shop that might take it, or a club I can sell to...or anyone looking for a board (preferably closer to campus)?

In particular I'm looking at special education.  <eos> \n","<bos> I'm applying for jobs for next semester and its either painters assistant or pool tech. Pool tech pays twenty cents more, but I would have to take a swim/endurance around the pool test to apply and I'm not sure I'm willing to do that.

We reviewed it with the professor multiple times throughout the semester to make sure we were still on track, and he said everything was looking good. But when we presented our final presentation, he grilled us during the presentation on parts he had told us were good when he reviewed it earlier, and the grade we were given on it was significantly lower than what we were expecting or feel we earned. Is there anything we can do about this? Has any sort of appeal ever been successful? (This is within Fisher College of Business btw) <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone else's wifi not working at all?

I just wanna know how the calculus classes are after taking so much math at Columbus State where the teacher/student ratio is about 25/1 (after all the first three week people drop out...) I mostly want to know about class size and material and all that jazz. Do they also make you use a computer for homework like with My Math Lab? <eos> \n","<bos> I am an incoming freshmen and I wanted know the pros and cons of either major. I know they share the same CS core classes but are the extra math classes and engineering classes worth it? Does going the CIS route handicap my chances at internships over CSE majors?

Thanks for any help! <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone got any info on if we can have them on campus and, if so, if they are restricted to certain areas? I've seen people shooting on West Campus before (obviously I wouldn't shoot on the Oval in the middle of the day) but I can't seem to find anything in the OSU Code of Conduct about it. The only thing I do know is that a strung bow is considered a weapon in Ohio, and while in every other jurisdiction around here that's not a problem (It's a 6 foot bow, it would fall under \"open carry\" as there is no way to conceal it), some jurisdictions do limit use of the bow in public parks (Columbus does, Clinton Township--where parts of west campus are in--does not, Upper Arlington--where other parts of west campus are in--does not so long as you aren't endangering anyone). Thanks for anything you guys might know about this! <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone else noticed when paying tuition, OSU is using a site charging 16 dollars to submit your payment online.

Currently my schedule has me taking a semester off physics and doing chem 1250 next semester alongside math 1172. I live close by so I’m wondering if it would be a better idea to take physics in the spring and do chem 1250 at c-state cause I’ve heard it’s an awful class. Thoughts? <eos> \n","<bos> Currently registered in the following electives for second session: 4212 Customer Relations Management w/ Nino Hardt 4220 Sales Management w/ Dale Davidson I am considering switching them out for the following: 4241 Entrepreneurial Marketing w/ Thomas Harvey 4252 Social Marketing  Public Policy w/ Curtis Haugtvedt Any advice on the following professors and class?

The circumstance being,of course, that said group(s) are able to work with a college student's schedule.

If you have a place PM me and I'll put you in contact! <eos> \n","<bos> So my 21st is coming up in a couple weeks and I'm trying to think of ideas on what to do. I'm pretty much the first of my close friends to turn 21 with an August birthday and since only a couple of my friends have fakes I don't think going to bars is gonna happen. I'd like to throw a party but my apartment isn't that big and I have a lot of different friend groups so it be be awkward since a lot of my friends don't know each other. Not to mention if I throw a party I'd want a decent amount of people there meaning I'd probably have to invite acquaintances which seems weird. Maybe I'm overthinking this but do you guys have any suggestions or experiences you'd like to share? Thanks!! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm trying to sign up for a course that appears to be open but it is asking for instructor permission, why is that?

Been a few years since I've had to do apartment searching so I'm a bit out of practice and lost. I'm looking for a place starting sometime in early August or late July. I'd ideally like a one-bedroom place or studio, $450 or less IF POSSIBLE (not including utilities), a bit off campus (I'm tired of living near campus, it's too loud for me atm). Not really sure how to look for places that aren't the usual campus leasing offices. Especially this time of year, when lots of the cheap places have been taken! <eos> \n","<bos> How is this class? is it really as easy as everyone says it is? I am looking a very very easy light class and since exams are 25% i'm kinda worried and they overlap with my other exams.

Can anyone talk about how crowded it gets at peak times?  <eos> \n","<bos> I normally work 30 hrs/wk at an on-campus job. I was assured I would have the same hours during the summer but during the first week of summer my manager informs me he has zero hours for me.  I've spent the past week looking for jobs everywhere (well, I don't have a car so not everywhere, but all over high street and Olentangy) but have not been able to secure a job. I'm assuming it's because I'm looking so late (I feel like manager really screwed me on the timing). Does anyone have ideas/leads on places to work? I am willing to do any work and minimum wage is fine with me. I have 4 years experience serving at Bob Evans and 2 years experience as a janitor.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey, I plan on living over at the Commons on Kinnear.

At least one of the campaigns is collecting phone numbers so that they can start calling you when campaigning begins, and they aren't asking you before they put your number on the list. If you don't want to get spammed with calls/texts, make sure you talk to people who might share your number ASAP.  (This is a throwaway account, I work for one of the campaigns that's pulling this phone bank shit and they get really mad when you call them out on it) <eos> \n","<bos> I just changed to AAE, and I really need this class this semester so I'm not behind a whole year. What are my chances that somebody will drop the class so I can get in? <eos> \n","<bos> When trying to find books for several of my classes, I use the osu store's book finder and for some reason my section number isn't listed. I can find the department and course, but that last category doesn't show my specific section.

How time consuming was it and did you have to write any papers?  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone get an actual date for it yet? I thought scheduling started here soon but maybe I'm wrong and it's just messed up for now. (And my date for fall term says December, 2015, lol).

I'm staying at the Lofts hotel so if anything is close by that would be great, but I'm sure Uber/taxi is an option. I'm also pushing 40, so while having a few at a college bar is great, My girlfriend and I don't exactly want to be the old folks in the wrong place all night. Thanks <eos> \n","<bos> So I figured reddit would be a nice place to do for this to find helpful people easily, so here's my question.  Typically how generous are the curves for Physics 1250 and Math 1151? Trying to figure out how much panic is appropriate here.  Is anyone who's taken these classes able to tell me how much of a curve they received? If if comes down to it I can use grade forgiveness, but obviously no one wants to have to do that. <eos> \n","<bos> i have a buddy who will be in town next weekend and we want to go to the v tech game. i have block o north season tickets, will he be good if he just buys a ticket or will he need a buck id? <eos> \n","<bos> I am kind of a quiet and lay back person with occasion of some excitements in trying new things.

I coasted through my freshman year and didn't learn how to properly study. Now I need to fix that, since I will suffer through 1172 and Phys1250.

I didn't get into the Visual Design program, but am really into designing and creating logos/marketing. I'm curious, since my focus would be more in the design realm, would it make more sense to go into Art Management or just Marketing? I'm worried Art Management is too specific, but that marketing is perhaps too broad? I have no idea, any ideas/advice is very much appreciated!! <eos> \n","<bos> I plan on going into law so this course is definitely a must for me but does it count for anything in terms of Gen Eds, cause it doesn't say so anywhere.  <eos> \n","<bos> I unfortunately don't have tickets to the VT game (I only have the Big 10 package), and I'm not willing to shell out $100 plus dollars for it.

The only option is 2 days away, which isn't very useful in my classes. I'd much rather receive the notification at a time I set so I can be reminded. Is there any option I'm not seeing? If there isn't, I definitely believe this is something that could prove very useful. <eos> \n","<bos> Seriously thinking about taking Social Dance I for men.

I need to take one more course as a math and science elective, so I figured I should take the one most relevant to the major instead of taking the easiest one. My choices are basically between calculus 3, differential equations, or engineering math B. Which of these would be the best to take for CSE? I've asked around a lot including cse open advising, but the answers are varied, so I'm just looking for the most input before I make my decision. Any help would be appreciated.  Also, if you think there are any classes better than these feel free to mention it or if you think none or a combination of these would be better.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hear ye, hear ye, Carmen is down :( <eos> \n","<bos> Right now I have TWC. We pay a shit ton of money (like 120 a month) for what's supposed to be 30/10, I believe, as well as basically alllll the channels. It's not a problem this year because split between 4 people it isn't bad. However next year I only have one other roommate, and I don't want to pay $60 a month. What should I go with for internet? I definitely want at least 30 down, preferably more, and whatever I can get for upload speed, but more than anything I want something that won't shit out and decide I only need 4 MBps. I have no idea what to do with cable either. The only things I care about are watching OSU football, Blue Jackets, and Seahawks, although I wouldn't mind being able to watch games from other teams too. As awesome as it would be to just get a package with sports channels, that's not a thing that exists... so what should I go with? I've streamed stuff from online before but it's never very good quality, and it kinda pisses me off as well as being a huge pain to set up. <eos> \n","<bos> 2 for 1!

Today is the first day and I feel like absolute shit. It might just be isolated to my classes and friend groups, but nonetheless it may be wise to wash your hands more often and sparta kick people who come to close to you.  That's all, Go Bucks!

I thought ray's $14 was pretty great and am not trying to pay more than $20, which i know a lot of the recommended barbers charge.  Is great clips bad or is it alright? and is there a person there that u would recommend? im a dude if that makes any difference. thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> Finally got in the system to choose my dorm. All of north is taken. I want air conditioning and a double but I don't have a roommate so I can fit pretty much anywhere.  Currently looking at Morrison Tower, Park-Stradley, Smith Steeb or Siebert. Which is best? Any other recommendations would be helpful.  Edit: I chose Park-Stradley Hall. It had more spots open than Smith-Steeb and I went through and checked the roommate preferences for the people already there and there was someone with more similar preferences to me in P-S. Any tips on living on south or this dorm/area in particular? I might go sneak in to check it out, though I found some pictures online. Any additional pictures would always be cool though! <eos> \n","<bos> I just applied to Fisher and was wondering if anyone knew any previous GPA cut-offs for the accounting specialization.

There's 60,000 people that go here would you assume it's safe to say people use it for hip hop? I produce and have had some success networking on soundcloud but I feel like I need to do more in person. I think it's free, they have weekly hours but he barely touched on it so I know like nothing about it at all <eos> \n","<bos> Hello, I will be living in a quad in Drackett Tower this coming year.

I took another job and am leaving the state soon. I ended my contract at the end of the Spring semester but still had obligations on campus so I had to go to CampusParc to get a new parking permit since I wasn't a faculty member anymore. I purchase a parking permit at the CampusParc office and go on my way. A couple days later I get a parking ticket for having an \"Unregistered Vehicle\". So I call CampusParc and and they said my vehicle wasn't registered, but I complain that I just bought a new permit a few days earlier. It turns out they linked my new permit to an old license plate even though I'd had a new license plate since November. So naturally I appeal the ticket.  Today I get an email from CampusParc saying they will drop the cost of the ticket to $7 for a \"failure to link\" violation and in the same letter they claimed that they didn't have my new license plate on file.....you know, despite the fact I'd parked on campus with the new license plate for more than half a year....So I log in and sure enough, my new license plate isn't in the system even though I distinctly remember adding it last fall. Unfortunately at this point, it's not worth $7 to spend the time doing a secondary appeal....which sickens me since I know that's exactly what CampusParc is bargaining on, that my time is worth more to me than a few bucks. I've heard too many similar stories from others about CampusParc. I'm planning to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and probably write a complaint letter to the Chamber of Commerce even though I know it won't do much. TLDR: CampusParc runs a dirty business. <eos> \n","<bos> Your attitudes and opinions about health information websites are needed!

I don't think that I could deal with the stress of taking another chemistry at Ohio State. <eos> \n","<bos> This has to stop. Especially for math classes. The math department literally says they only raise the grading scale if the class median is below a C-. Since OSU has been increasing their admission standards over the years, these medians have only been going up. From a friend I know for Math 1172 all of the midterms this year had a median above a C-. Also, there is no way to know if there's actually going to be a curve until all the grades are posted, which is why asking about previous curves in the past is pointless. Even for the same course number, some instructors are easier or just better at teaching than others.  Expect no curves. Just study. If you can't help those intrusive thoughts about a curve, redirect those thoughts when you get them. Tell yourself \"I shouldn't expect a curve, I need to learn this material because there won't be a curve at all\". <eos> \n","<bos> Wondering if anyone has the ME 2010 book PDF?

Is anyone who has received services from CCS (or attempted to) willing to share their experience or have any idea what their criteria is for servicing vs refusing students (e.g. they seem to refuse to see suicidal students, students with more 'serious' illnesses like bipolar or schizophrenia, etc.)? If you've done a phone screening with them, what did they ask?  Not that I would lie to them about my situation to get free services, but it would be so disheartening to be turned down at this point. I have no other options... I'm just wondering if there's anything that will increase or decrease my chances of being referred to one of their counselors, or if I should expect to be turned down.  I'm looking for help with social anxiety and mild depression, and I am not and never have been suicidal. <eos> \n","<bos>  On 07/03/2013 a wonderful person was murdered on 2400 block of Medary Avenue at about 12:33 a.m. If you happened to be in the area of North East campus on 07/03/2013 and saw or heard anything please contact the Columbus police homicide squad at 614-645-4730. If you happen to know any one who lives/was in the general area it would be wonderful if you could spread the word about this crime. Brian Vura was one of the nicest people we knew, any detail could be useful to the investigation.

Does anyone know when campusparc will get updated student info? It still has me listed as rank 1-dorm when I'm rank 2 and living off campus. :/ I'm moving in the first week of August and need a permit. Campusparc says they can't do anything until my info is updated and the student service center is clueless. Any ideas? <eos> \n","<bos> I know when you apply to your engineering major they only take into consideration your science/math courses such as Physics and Calc for your gpa, but if you take a math elective not required will they put that into your GPA as well? if so is that a good way to raise your gpa from some of the tougher classes if you have space? <eos> \n","<bos> Hello, I've heard that the Bio 1113 EM test is very passable, so I am going to try to get credit for it to lighten my schedule. I am hoping to do some studying for it over break and at the beginning of the semester, and will probably try to take the test around the end of January. Does anybody here have any tips on how to prepare for this test? Even a recent syllabus of the class would be helpful so I can see what I'm supposed to know. Thanks for the help. <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone take 4110 with minozzi? Is it hard at all? What is the deliberation day like? <eos> \n","<bos> Looking for 2 tickets for the Tulsa game on Saturday.

I'm currently in the CIS program and it just doesn't spark my interest, so I figure now would be the best time to reconsider my options.

But I can only find that edition in the school book star and it will cost me like 80 bucks. I found the normal edition for that book and i can even rent that one for like $20. So is it okay if i just get the normal one, if anyone has taken this class i would love your input.  <eos> \n","<bos> I have to work until around 8:30 tomorrow night, and I’ll have spotty service during the game.

On the heels of elimating all sexual assault resources they provide to students. I am editing this because when I initially posted I was led to believe by a individual I trust that there was empirical evidence of the police profiling women for underage drinking charges. After further speaking with her it is clear that evidence is not available.  I still want to dive in to how this is problematic victim blaming behavior though. Justifying this kind of policing with that evidence is insane. The correlation between alcohol and sexual assault occurs because many victims are intoxicated, not offenders. Whether or not your drunk doesn’t matter unless a rapist is nearby.  The problem isn’t that people are drunk and need to be arrested more. The problem is that it is still societally acceptable for people to rape others when they are incapable of defending themselves. Punishing others in order to take away “opportunities” for rapists is not a fair strategy. I particularly troubled that this strategy immediately followed SCE’s suspension of services. I️t makes me wonder what OSU actually has coming to deal with sexual assault on campus.  <eos> \n","<bos> ok so I have a couple questions 1. when I looked on the list of books for math 1150 (PreCalc) it says the required textbook is for algebra and trigonometry, which seems wrong but maybe it's right? can anyone who has taken this class confirm/deny this is the book for the class? 2. for psych 1100 it says the textbook is required but there is also online book access for about the same price, I usually just use the normal textbook but if the online one has extra problems and resources id definitely consider buying it! does anyone feel like the online one would be useful  3. this is a general question but do any professors make you bring your textbooks to class? <eos> \n","<bos> Right now I'm living in a great location south of campus, but I'm hearing awful things about my rental company and I'm really interested in renting from private owners next year.

The room is shared; you and a friend can sublease it from me and my roommate, or you can sublease just one half of the room yourself.

Briefly I'm from London in England, I graduated my undergraduate degree last June in the UK and flew out the next month to start here at grad school. Whilst I'm a postgrad student, my age makes it feel slightly different. I'm here for 3 years so there should be time to grow up. Anyway if there's anything you feel like asking about - my perspective on life here, on moving 4000 miles to study, on UK/USA similarities and differences -then please feel free.

He was an amazing, caring, and funny teacher. He cared so much about the students and their success. He has so much passion for teaching Chem 121 and other classes. At the end of the year he made a slideshow for our class to sum up the quarter, it was comprised of our SEI comments(which were hilarious) and his personal reasons why he started teaching and getting his degree. It was a sad and beautiful message toward the end(about his mom's death) and he had almost everybody in the class in tears. I was tearing up too. After I got out of that class, I said he was going to be the best teacher that I will have at OSU. Still holds.

If I'm including all the right classes I think my EPHR is a 3.305, but if that's likely not high enough I should definitely have at least a 3.4 to apply next semester.

Honestly I don't care if it's a house, apartment, condo or townhouse. We could figure that all out together.

Based on the courseware of cse, I'm just about finished (which is why we should be able to get something at least).

I've already talked to my advisor so I know my next step is talking to SSC and columbus state, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice or experience to share?  I was thinking of taking online classes, are these harder to take there? I'm looking at doing basic math classes to get out of the way so they don't affect my GPA (trying to get into my major that's constantly raising it's GPA and i'm shit at math i'll admit it) and I want to take one or two over the summer while I'm on my internship.

I was referred to /r/osu a few weeks back as I've been told a lot of CSE majors and programmers are on here, so here I am. Position would require about 20 hours a week and can be both payed monetarily and with a possibility of some equity depending on how good you are. Plus it would look seriously good on your resume. If you look at my past posts you'll get a good idea of what my team and I are working on. It's basically an iOS and Android marketplace for OSU students with some exciting new technology to make things like buying and selling football (and other) tickets a whole lot easier. iOS version here: [url link] (We'll just be porting the iOS version) If you have what's listed below then we'd love to sit down and chat.  - Experience working in Android.

Although all of the people signing up for my group are ranks 3 or 4 (possibly all 4, but I'm not sure), I opened the group to ranks 2-4 because I wasn't sure if someone in my group would invite a rank 2.  Since I'm new to this, I didn't realize that they placed us based on class rank, so higher ranks would get higher priority and better seats.  So my question is: is the \"group rank\" dependent on who's actually in the group, or who it's open to? So even if my group is open to rank 2, if I have no rank 2 people in my group, will the group be rank 3 (or 4)?

I graduated with a 4 year degree in 2015 and didnt really try. Now 3 years later I realize Id like to return with a different major entirely, and really put my all into it.

Just curious if anyone knew. <eos> \n","<bos> I have a friend from a different country who wants to study at OSU next year, but he’s not sure if he can swing the out of state tuition flat out. So, he’s trying to find ways (besides loans) to lessen the cost of tuition and room and board here. For his planning purposes, does anyone know what the salaries/stipends are like for OAs and RAs? I assume RAs get free housing and some sort of help with a meal plan, but does anyone know how that translates roughly into a salary for each academic year? I didn’t want to ask my friends who are OAs and RAs in case they could get cited or something for divulging that information.

Is it worth it or should I just take 2200 and 2300?

I am looking to buy 10 or so tickets to The Game. Let me know if you are selling or if you know someone is who is!  If they are together, even better, but I would like to lock them down as soon as possible because some flight tickets depend on whether or not these tickets materialize.

I petitioned for 19 credit hours, so I don't think I'll get refunded for the extra credit hour, but I'm worried I'm going to do just as bad in this class.

I am a senior here at OSU, and i see how popular this subreddit is so I thought to let you all know that for this Campus Rep I am selling tickets to the games on 9/29 and 10/28.

I'm discussing the shift from these enterprise solutions to social network sites to deal with campus issues, and it'd be very helpful to get polling responses from the major college subreddits.

I've got a few friends swinging by tomorrow day with nothing to do and I figured they'd enjoy checking out the stadium, if we can get in.  So I've read that they'll let you in if you sign a guest sheet, that gate 23 is (always) open, that its open since there's classes, that its closed, etc. Can anyone tell me a surefire (legal) way to get into the stadium tomorrow afternoon without having to worry about getting the cops called on me? <eos> \n","<bos> I’ve never been to one of these before. Can some one give a quick synopsis of what to expect? What to bring/wear? What they’ll want to talk about? What majors they’re typically looking for? Is it really worth going to? #*Edit: For those that come to this looking for advice in the future:* It’s actually worth going to. I only knew of two tables (Student legal services, Ohio Department of Public Safety) that was accepting resumes, most told you to look online and pointed you to their site and gave you contact info. Go to as many tables as you can. You never know where you’ll get a good opportunity. I’m a POLITSC major, and my best hit came from the Leukemia  Lymphoma Society. They don’t outright ask you to talk about yourself. They’ll offer a handshake and expect you to get down to business. Lines aren’t very long if you go at the start of the fair. There’s printers in the resource room up the stairs and to the left in the union if you couldn’t/didn’t print out your resume. You should probably still have like 10 copies of it even though few tables were taking them. The majority were CSE based, but that will vary each time I’m sure. Don’t be afraid to go up and talk to tables you didn’t look up/research beforehand. Just tell them about yourself and your interests and ask what opportunities they have that might fit what you’re looking for. Nobody asked anything about my GPA, if that’s something that might scare you off. Look at the comments for more tips from helpful strangers. <eos> \n","<bos> Do campus park employees have this type of power?

Instead of the water and free cups, I found that there was a sign stating something along the lines of, \"We removed the free hot water because it was adversely affecting out customers\".  Now, besides that line sounding like bunk to me, is there any other cafe on campus that provides hot water for tea like Thompson used to? <eos> \n","<bos> Do they administer a drug test at any point in the application process/throughout employment?

I was seen, \"treated\" (they have no idea what is wrong with me) and released in 4 hrs. I have the Student Comprehensive Insurance.

I got kinda tired of looking up every single road in the damn city on Google Maps and then forgetting it 20 seconds later. Anyways, my boyfriend signed a lease for an apartment with Pella near N High St and W Oakland Ave. It looked nice when he signed it, he asked about crime and such and they said basically not to worry about anything. He doesn't go around that area much so he trusted what they told him. I didn't think much of it until I was browsing through some stuff on here about campus crime. It seems like where our apartment is might not be a great area. If anyone has any experiences with either just hearing about crime, or has lived there, knows someone who lives/lived there, etc. feedback would be appreciated.  <eos> \n","<bos> What are the chances OSU could increase the number of buses on each route? Right now there are only three active buses on the CLN and CLS routes which means long waits and full buses. I waited for a CLS bus for 20 mins only for it to be full.

My GPA is a 3.6 and I'm ranked 47th out of 177 students in my class (I attend a relatively competitive high school).  My ACT is currently a 27. I took it again in October and I'm expecting a higher score, so they might get the updated score before they review my application.  I have taken 5 AP classes and some honors/accelerated classes. I took Spanish for three years and I have been in marching band and wind ensemble for four years. I also have done a bit of community service, Model UN, and some student political stuff.  I wrote a pretty good college essay and I got an awesome letter of recommendation from one of my English teachers.  My main concern is my class rank and test scores.

I didn't do as well as I wanted in math 1151 (go figure) and was considering using a grade forgiveness to repeat the course.

I put everything I had into getting admission into the College of Nursing I don't even have any friends or any social life because of it in order to maintain a perfect GPA... and for what exactly... I have debt now and still no degree.. to say that I'm crushed would be an understatement I just don't have anything else left in me what's the point of any of it...

Like say, the spring game today?  <eos> \n","<bos> I transferred in to OSU from a different community college. At that school I definitely had instructors who were harder than anyone I've had at OSU. So when I heard other engineering students say that CSCC was taking the easy way out I didn't believe it. But now I have to say they were right and I was wrong. I think it would have been more challenging to redo my high school algebra course than the course I took at CSCC. Can I generalize and say all courses at CSCC are like that? No, but I did get the impression that this was as difficult as it gets over there. So my advice is if you really want to learn the subject don't take the course at CSCC. The other option is to supplement your learning with online material which is what I did. <eos> \n","<bos> Does anyone know anything about this organization? Would I be welcome as a Trump supporter and it would be alt-righters or would it just be a bunch of RINOs? <eos> \n","<bos> Hello, I’m a incoming transfer. I am wondering how does a sedan (low car) do in Ohio specially during winters with rain and snow? Is it necessary to have a SUV for the winter weather ? <eos> \n","<bos> So I have made a couple posts about how I feel about ME 2020 and 2030 together and that I am finding it hard to balance out these two courses. I am trying to keep up on everything in the courses such as the lecture problems, recitation problems and homework problems as well as quizzes when they arise, but I am finding it difficult to keep up and practice the lecture notes every time I cant remember how to do them, but I am getting the homeworks done as well as the quizzes.  My biggest issue is having little to no free time if I am doing this. I spend almost every waking moment either trying to get my homework done or keep up on the lecture notes and recitation problems. So does anyone have any advice on what I should not focus on and just pinpoint on either the homework and recitation problems or is it really necessary to go over the lecture notes as well. I know that going over everything will ensure me a good grade IF I can retain it all, but this seems like an impossible task as there is so much to go over on a weekly basis. But if just doing the homework and recitation problems as well as the quizzes over again, should I be able to make it through the semester with alright grades? At CSCC this has proven to be helpful for the ME courses I was taking there, but I know OSU is much much harder. I took ISE 2040 last semester and doing the homework problems as a review was almost pointless as I had got a D on the first midterm, but the course packet our teacher told us to bring to class daily ended up being a better resource to study from and I ended up with a B at the end of the course. I know there isn't a specific answer to my question so any advice on how people are managing/have managed to get through these courses together would be very helpful. <eos> \n","<bos> I heard 1101 was easy, but I was wondering if 1100 was basically the same thing.

I'm not trying to make a profit, I bought this ticket a few months back for a friend who can't make it anymore.

I tried answering some stuff but I'm doing the BS CIS so idk much.  Anyway...they can't get into the major yet because they just need to reach the GPA minimum after this sem, but he had some questions I hoped someone would answer about anyone's experience (advisors weren't that helpful because his questions were too specific, and he has to wait for an assignes advisor to figure this out) 1. What \"related core\" courses/field did you pick? Was it easy getting the courses approved? Can those courses come from different departments..like Stats, neuroscience, biology, etc as long as they're approved? 2. Were you able to get intro courses like genchem, gen bio, etc able to count as related core courses and credit hours? (They switched majors late) 3. How flexible is everything? My friend is really interested in focusing on databases, and is also planning on taking math courses up to diff eq and wants to do a stats minor as well, or use the stats courses as part of the related core or something like that for what he wants to study and focus on.  Thank you!!  <eos> \n","<bos> Does anyone know how much the valet is at the James?  <eos> \n","<bos> Does anyone need a warm winter coat? When I was in the Navy, my pea coat was stolen. I had to buy a civilian one to wear while my issued replacement (which I also had to buy) came in. I forgot I still had the knock-off one until I was going through some boxes. Anyway, if you're 5'9\" to 6'1\", 180-230, the coat should fit you. The tag says 46. [Here's a picture.] ([url link] If you want it, reply here (even with a throwaway) and you can pick it up from my office on central campus. If I don't hear from anyone, I'll drop it off at Volunteers of America. It's a warm coat that doesn't belong in a box right now.  <eos> \n","<bos> So if im applying to CSE with a 3.2 GPA, and a C- in CSE 2221, will that get me denied since my MPHR is less than a 2.0 from the C- in SW1?  <eos> \n","<bos> Here's my problem. I am a sophomore, but this is only my 2nd semester at OSU. I transferred here last semester, didn't do so great, and now I currently have below a 3.0 (so my GPA is top priority.) I am falling very behind in the Econ 2001 class (got sick and missed a bunch of work) but i've gotten A's and B+'s in all my other classes thus far. If I drop the class and keep my current grades I can get my GPA above a 3.0 and apply to fisher next fall. Without taking a \"W\" I will stay below a 3.0 and have to wait even longer. Will doing this hurt my chances of getting accepted?  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, I'm interested in getting involved in research this upcoming semester, but to be honest I'm not really sure how to go about this. I contacted a couple professors I had in the spring, but they never responded to emails. Any advice how I could get a research position for the fall? (I won't be in Columbus until mid-August). Any suggestions or advice is appreciated, thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> Is there an tutoring available, I’m struggling rn  <eos> \n","<bos> Who all has lived in Morril Tower?

The app currently allows you to place orders from Courtside and Woody's for pickup or PAD for pickup or delivery.  If you haven't used online ordering before, it's a great way to skip the lines and use your vx meals. Just select your meal and pick a time and it will be ready when you arrive. If you're interested, here's the link: [url link] If you have any questions I'm happy to answer them and I'd love to hear any feedback from those who give it a try.  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone taken this before?

But that means that I don't get to eat enough to gain any muscle. But since I'm always walking around I don't have time to really make meals. So how do you guys make sure you eat a ton while being able to commute back and forth?  I go to the gym. But since I wasn't gaining mass I thought I probably don't eat enough. But I don't got the time to make the meals I do over the weekend/ can't carry around protein powder and milk everywhere I go <eos> \n","<bos> The university libraries are looking for student feedback on their new search feature for the [redesigned website currently in beta]([url link] There will be people at the SEL today (2/8), Tuesday (2/13), and Thursday (2/15) from 1 to 2pm, and they'll be giving out candy or sparkling water to volunteers.  <eos> \n","<bos> and why? <eos> \n","<bos> Hi all,  I never thought I would be posting about this, but this past semester was not my greatest by far. I ended up not passing both Math 1172 and Chem 1250. It has brought down my GPA a significant amount and I need to decide what I am going to do next. I love engineering and couldn't see myself doing anything else, but the GPA requirement for ME just keeps climbing and climbing. Is it worth sticking it out another semester to see where I land with some easier classes (relatively)? What would happen to my GPA if I were to switch to a business major? Would it even be worth switching majors within engineering? I know a lot of these questions may be answered by advisers, but the one I was assigned has been horrendous. I also think some of you can give me better insight if you have been in the same situation before. Thanks in advance!  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone from Audrey Sawyer's Earth Science 1121 class want to study with me? I bombed the midterm pretty hard and need to work hard to get my grade up. <eos> \n","<bos> Just a heads up everyone- A black male introducing himself as Cedric is making the rounds again selling \"magazines\". Hint, you won't receive them. I didn't think about taking his picture, but please do if this guy stops by. I know several people who have bought a \"subscription\", never to hear anything again. My roommate cut him a $100 check and when I told him to call and cancel it, it was cashed within 10 minutes. This guy needs to be locked up. <eos> \n","<bos> For any of you that are into Minecraft or have been in the past, I built this [replica of Thompson Library on Ohio State's campus]([url link] I finished it about 4 years ago but feel like sharing.

The past 3 days I've just eaten at scott's and it seems like I **always** just go for a salad or fries or mac  cheese because I don't want to wait 30 minutes for the other specials they have.

Was wondering what everybody experience was with either TWC or other providers?

It's a decent assumption; I'm sure 99% of our millions of alumni are rabid fans, especially among young, recently graduated males.  Except I don't know a single player on the team, and the thought of sitting through a game bores me to tears. Usually I can bullshit my way through a conversation with vague answers (\"Oh yeah, gotta love that Urban Meyer!\"), luckily, but there are definitely times I have to let them know that they found the one alumni who really doesn't care.  It's not anything about the buckeyes in particular, I'm just apathetic about sports of any kind. Anyone else out there?  <eos> \n","<bos> They just announced Columbus City Schools are to be closed tomorrow. Any word on whether OSU gets a second day of winter shut down?

I'd exchange a glance with the always-sad-looking cashier. It was a vital part of my daily routine. Then, a couple days ago, I noticed the station was all boarded up and being emptied. The gas pumps had caution tapes all around them. Then today, the door was locked shut with no signs of life. [Pic]([url link] Anyone know what happened? Bankrupt? Money Laundering?

Currently, I take 16 credits, the classes being Physics 1250, Math 1151, CSE 1223, Survey, and FE. Would it be optimal to drop either Physics 1250 or Calc 1 and take one of them either next semester or next summer?

Never ate there but it was brought up somehow in a conversation and now I'm being driven insane because no matter how hard I google-fu I can't find any trace of it. This place existed, right?!?? HELP. <eos> \n","<bos> Is there a limit to the size of a group you can have for group seating?

If you have a couple openings in your place that would be even better so my current roommate can come as well since he is in the same position as me. I'm a huge OSU and college football fan, Columbus Crew fan, and I drink but don't smoke. I also play some video games and like to just be around people in general. I'd prefer to be east or north and it has to be within walking distance of campus. Any price is pretty much fine, I'm pretty clean, and can supply some electronics for the place. Let me know if you or a friend are needing a subletter! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm an incoming freshman going into a difficult program and I'm really worried about not liking the campus/not feeling the fulfillment I hope to feel. My whole summer has been a lot of ups and downs (I ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago because I thought I was having a stroke or something and it ended up being a massive panic attack). I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I used to see a therapist a year ago but my symptoms improved with CBT. They've gotten worse again, however, with the transition, and I would like someone to talk to, but I heard counseling has a lot of waiting. I'd be okay with seeing someone around once a month but I really just want someone to break down to here and there.  My roommates are all really jolly and I don't know if it might be depression or something but I feel like no one around me should really be happy. I don't want to drain the life out of the room every time I step in. My friends where I am right now always knew me as being funny and extroverted but this whole transition has depressed me so much and I'm so afraid that I wont do well in my classes or at making friends :( Has anyone else here been suddenly struck with massive anxiety/mental changes before the big move? How do you get over that and learn to be happy? <eos> \n","<bos> Can I just go during open hours? I want to bypass Ticketmaster this time, if possible. <eos> \n","<bos> Worth going to?

I don't have a 3.0 right now so the earliest I could get in is next year, at the beginning of my sr. yr. I'm not completely abandoning trying to get in in the future, but for right now I declared to be in the Economics BA program (and plan on applying to the Capital program), after I was put on warning for the pre-business program. Any econ majors want to tell me what to expect? I'm kind of bummed about having to switch to a non competitive BA program from pursuit of a competitive BS one. <eos> \n","<bos> Is there anywhere I can look to get a good idea what my options are for housing next year as an incoming freshman? I heard that they send out the housing contracts in late march for the incoming class, so I'm trying to get a solid idea of what I want to try for, so I can turn it in as soon as possible. I have heard that north campus is a good option since a lot of the newer houses are up there, but I wasn't sure if the new dorms were available for freshman. I also have one person that I plan on rooming with from my current school, and we wanted to try and get a suite so we could meet some new people as well, but we haven't really been able to find anything online that says what the different layouts are that we can choose from, whether it be a two person room or a quad or a multi-person suite, any advice? thanks <eos> \n","<bos> Hey /r/OSU, I was in outside Thompson library today shooting a video for an fundraising; and unfortunately I left my friends lens sitting out there. It was a Sigma 10-20 mm lens for Canon in a black lens holder.  I know that the chance one of you have seen it is really small, but I am trying every avenue possible. So, please let me know if any of you know anything about it.  Thanks guys!  <eos> \n","<bos> OK I don't know why the title is in caps. For some reason I can't fix that.  So after this summer I might have a gpa of a 3.0 and I need to get an A in those three classes to get into the major. I'm not asking because I'm complaining but If that's impossible for me to get in than I might switch to Electrical Engineering now so I don't waste a semester or two. Context about my ability. Did a B- in physic 1250 and C+ in 1172 (but the latter was due to just being lazy I could have pulled off a B). B+ in 1151.  So far I'm doing well in physics 1251 (thank God for that one).  So now it seems my chance to get in at all or nor not is based on whether those classes are extremely difficult or not.  <eos> \n","<bos> According to [this article by The Lantern]([url link] Afro duck and others were relocated to a farm in Delaware County and will not be returning. <eos> \n","<bos> So I am really determined to start loosing weight, I am a pretty heavy person. I want to use the RPAC facility and start swimming regularly. Would it be weird for me to be there? If I am using the lap pool would I be in the way of athletic swimmers?  Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> So I had a midterm today, and my usual method is circling answers in the packet, then going back through to fill in the scantron while going over the questions. Somehow, I noticed while looking at one question I wasn't sure of that there was a period next to one of the answers. I figured it was a typo. Looked at the next question, same thing, a period next to only one of the answers, the answer I chose. Looked through the whole test, and sure enough, every question but one had a period next to the answer, and I had circled the option every time that had a period next to it. I really don't know how that happens. How do you just screw up and hand that out to your class? <eos> \n","<bos> Hi all, I'm interested in applying to OSU's MAS program.

He turned down the road towards Thompson (I'm assuming he didn't know it was a dead end) and by the time I get there there was a bike and a helmet laying on the ground with a younger male yelling at him for driving so fast. Some \"fuck you's\" were exchanged and the guy sped off. I thought about grabbing the license plate but I figured if it was an accident then he'd be staying around.  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone know?  <eos> \n","<bos> Can you pass a course with a D in CSE if you don't need a pre reqs for it? <eos> \n","<bos> Summer internships are ending soon for most seniors (including myself) and hopefully everyone will get a full-time offer. For those with previous experience, I have a few questions? 1. What was your major and career field? 2. Did you negotiate your offer and was it successful? 3. Did you receive a signing bonus? 3. Do you recommend still interviewing elsewhere? Some people I know see an offer as a chance to skip the arduous interview season in the fall. 4. If you still interviewed elsewhere, how much more difficult and/or time-consuming is it compared to interviewing for an internship? <eos> \n","<bos> I was parked on Norwich between High and Indianola on Friday and got a ticket for violating the street sweeping policy.

I still want to go to OSU and will try to transfer for sophomore year. How does transferring into CSE work, the website isn't much help. Can I skip into the major if I keep up with the needed classes for Pre-CSE and have a high enough GPA or do I have to stay in pre for a year and have to spend another year in school?

I am applying to Fisher at the end of the semester (June 1st). However, I am looking to schedule classes for next year and some say that \"admission to the business major is required to enroll in these courses\". To summarize: I will technically not be in Fisher at the time of class registration, however I will (hopefully) be in Fisher by the start of the AU18 semester. Since I won't be in Fisher at the time of registration, will this prevent me from scheduling these business classes? <eos> \n","<bos> And a good semester!

I am a reporter for Murrow News Service at Washington State University. I am currently working on a story about how prepared our school is for a dangerous situation such as an active shooter, bomb threat, etc. Like virtually every college in the US, WSU has many measures in place to protect staff and students if such a situation were to occur, however, I am hoping to gain insight as to how these situations actually play out in reality.  In light of this, I was hoping to speak with someone who was present on the OSU campus during the recent attacks. If anyone would be willing to speak with me about your personal experience, please feel free send me a private message, or email me at william.demarco@wsu.edu. I just have a few quick questions, and the time commitment should be about five minutes or less. Your feedback would be very much appreciated.

I mean if I buy a permit and then one week I'm driving a loaner, I have a parking pass but not for the loaner so I get a ticket? That's not how a parking pass works in my opinion.

After trying to ignore it for about five minutes, it didn't stop, so I got up and answered it. I thought it could be an emergency if this was constant pressing of the doorbell over and over. It was a gas and energy company \"trying to save me money\". I am so pissed and I want to call to complain, but I didn't get the name of the company.

I am in a science major right now and entering my 2nd year, but I really don't know what I am doing/what I want to do with my life. I really thought I wanted to do pre\\-med, and I still think that is what I want to do, but I am not sure. I started a research lab in May and I am absolutely miserable in it. The only reason I did it was because every other pre\\-med with my major started doing it and I got stressed and felt like I was behind. I don't know what to do right now cause I feel I have dug myself too deep with all of the things I have started and all of the connections I have made. I told my advisor about this but she said that it's not a good idea to quit anything right now as I would be burning bridges, but I have just never felt this anxious and sad about something. I'm most worried about realizing too late what I want to do and having to take several gap years or something. When did you guys figure out what you wanted to do? For those of you who found out later, did you end up being successful/happy? Sorry this is so long, I just really needed some advice as this anxiety has had me in a really depressed mood for a few weeks, which is not like me at all.  <eos> \n","<bos> I'm transferring in the fall and getting new fakes.

I just got into OSU and am super excited at the possibility of being a Buckeye. I will be choosing between OSU and IU and have a few questions... Is it true that the Fisher school of business is \"on the rise\"? IU's business school is ranked ~10 and OSU's is ~30. But I have read that by the time I graduate OSU's will be similarly ranked.  How hard is it to get internships out of Fisher?  Is it hard to get student football/basketball tickets?  Is a fake ID necessary to have fun at OSU if you are underage? I have a bit of legal trouble at the moment (im a juvenile and everything is getting expunged) but I do not want to get in trouble again and jeopardize future employment prospects.  How strict are the OSU police on underage drinking and pot? And a more general set of questions: What are your favorite and least favorite things about OSU?

I realize it takes years of practice to actually get good at, but I’m looking for a structured start on the basics. <eos> \n","<bos> I got physics at that time and it's basically all the clubs I signed up for are around that time period.

Looks like a screwdriver might do the trick but curious if anyone's pulled it off. <eos> \n","<bos> So, I'm trying to figure a good place to take my family to eat after the graduation ceremony this weekend. I'm trying to avoid easton and polaris because I'm sure they will both be chaos, as everyone else will probably want to take their family out too. I don't know too many good restaurants outside of these areas. So, what would be a good place to take them? Something that could handle a large party (10 or so), is very clean, and not too expensive ($15 entree max).  <eos> \n","<bos> I just realized that I won't be able to make it to the game tomorrow, and I'm trying to get rid of my ticket last minute.

Please do not drive such professors away with your incessant back-biting and child-like enthusiasm for complaints. I understand how you might get frustrated with some low-quality teaching, and it cannot be avoided in a behemoth like this. But there are many who care for you, and for their sake at least, please stop complaining about courses being hard, about grades being unfair, and about content being boring...Sometimes, content has to be boring to make you realize what you are in for..and hopefully, you will realize it is not for you, and do something else that will make you happy.

Even though my social life is nonexistent, OSU is probably the best fit for me academically and financially, so I at least plan on finishing my degree here. That being said, I am absolutely clueless on what I should be doing for housing. I don't know if I should just get a single apartment and accept that my weekends will primarily consist of drinking alone, or if I should try finding a house that needs one guy and hoping I fit in. Any advice anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated <eos> \n","<bos> Good Morning! I am graduating this year, and I feel that I need to do some more game-day stuff than just roll in to the game 15 minutes ahead of time. My girlfriend is coming down for the game as well and I was thinking about going to the skull session as well as anything else that might be in the area of the stadium on gameday. 1) I know the skull session is at St. John's arena, but is there anything I need to know about how early to arrive? IIRC, it starts at 6pm? 2) Anything else to do in the 2 hours between the skull session and kickoff that anyone would recommend? Thanks guys, and GO BUCKS! <eos> \n","<bos> I was wondering what you thought of this class, so far it seems ez but very tedious.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hi! I'm transferring to Ohio State with 42 credits from an East Coast school and because I took a semester off, I'll be 21 in the fall. I don't know a lot of people there so I'm starting brand new and am incredibly confused about everything haha.  1. Is Neilwood Gables/Mendoza House a good place to live? 2. Which football section should I pick? 3. What's the honors program like? I'll be in the business school, but am considering double majoring in psych so I could do the arts and sciences honors program instead.  <eos> \n","<bos> The Daredevil Dogs guys was promoting the app the other day and now it has 6 free wings.

What they didn't make obvious (like with the health insurance) is that you can opt out of this service. To do so sign in to your Student Center, then under Finances is a drop down menu and select Student Legal Services. This will take you to a page where you can save $40!

And also if the Barnes n Noble ([url link] OSU bookstore is accurate with their textbook listings. I entered my classes and for Math 151.01 they gave me 2 required textbooks which were just different editions, 2 calculator recommendations, etc... and the required textbook here [url link] is completely different!

Thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> I feel increasingly like OSU is only interested in providing the bare minimum, but making it look good. Like all of my tuition is just going into a void somewhere and not much of I️t is benefitting me. Am I alone? Thoughts? I know it’s always been about the money but why do I feel like a chump on the end of a bad bargain? <eos> \n","<bos> Hey everyone, okay so basically I want to swap my major to CSE. I am a transfer student and i have taken an introductory java class at my previous institution. Sadly, i did not get my credit evaluated and i have to take the placement test. For those of you who have taken the test, how exactly was it structured? You don't have to tell me exactly what you did but just a general layout since the sample question seemed a bit too easy to be true. Will probably be taking the test using matlab syntax. I'm just worried syntax/minor errors will screw me over. Any help is appreciated, Thanks :D  <eos> \n","<bos> Last week midway was 18+ to get in, but I'm not sure if it was just for the ski club social.

As long as you aren't failing anything are these reports likely to have a huge impact on your decision, will your admission be revoked for say, a few C's? <eos> \n","<bos> Of all the classes I'm taking this first semester, these two are the ones I'm especially focused on doing well in (5 credit hours for each one is a lot). What helped you do well? I'm already taking note of office hours, hours offered by the MSLC, making concerted efforts to manage my time more wisely, but what else would you all recommend? <eos> \n","<bos> okay, so I'm looking at my statement of account right now and it has a section of my unapplied transactions which are a few grants and part of a loan, so am i going to get this back in the overage check?

Thank you. <eos> \n","<bos> For reasons I'm not going to get into, as of late I don't really have any friends or anything to do outside of classes, despite being a junior here now. Since the semester's a month in, it almost seems impossible to find student organizations or volunteering opportunities, especially since I didn't go to the Involvement Fair or anything. I'm just really looking for any suggestions for student life here, anything you know of. I suck at sports but - as woobie as it sounds - I'm really just looking for places to make friends here. Thanks in advance. <eos> \n","<bos> I just graduated, and will hopefully be starting a PhD in August. In the mean time, I need something to do. My research advisor (in Mechanical Engineering) offered to pay me to keep doing research, which I would love to do. However, he said that there are rules preventing me from working more than 30 hours a week, and I can only work for the first half of the semester. Both of these rules are kinda shitty.  Is this policy university-wide, or could I potentially be employed in a different department? He has a courtesy appointment in ChemE and probably BME.  <eos> \n","<bos> Just seeing which one was easier. My options are 2480 (kubatko/richards) vs 2450 (Duda). <eos> \n","<bos> I saw some in Hitchcock room 308 or something.

I thought the stipulation was that you have to have residency in Ohio for 1 year to be eligible for in-state tuition. Friend's college savings accounts are not in state, so does the location of the money flow matter in this situation? Given that situation what are the reqs for in state for those who have done it?

As a transfer student I had to take business admin 1100. In the class they pretty much teach you about OSU and all the other good stuff. Now the professor is also our advisor which is key. In the first week of classes, we were told that we had to choose our majors for fisher. I was not aware of this because I was India the first week. I had let the professor know that I would be missing the first week and if we are doing anything important the first class. She said no and I didn't think much of it. Fast forward to now, I was signing up for classes and while doing so I could not sign up for the business core classes. The reason is because Im still pre-bus. I email my advisor asking why I was still Pre bus only for her to tell me that I never declared a major. Now I have to fill a petition for me to get into a major in the summer because my professor/advisor never even told me to declare a major the first week of school. She said it probably will not get through since I have already almost done a semester here I have to qualify for the 12 credit hour rule so I might have to wait till next spring has a junior to do my business core classes. The reason that I'm stressing about it is because I'm going to be a junior by the end of this semester and I'm still not in the business school yet. Anyone been in a situation like this before?  <eos> \n","<bos> I took Org Chem I last fall and this semester I will be taking Org Chem II and the 2540 lab. I was hoping people who have taken the lab might be willing to talk about some of their experiences with it. For example, the time slot for the lab is 5:30-9:30 each week. Were the full 4 hours ever used consistently or is it more akin to the Gen Chem labs where most people only used about 75% of the time usually? Wondering if I should consider the possibility that I'll ever be able to eat a late dinner instead of eating dinner at 3:30-4:00 and going to bed instantly when I get home. I'd also be interested to know how other students might compare it to other chemistry labs. I'm sure it won't be pleasant, but is it significantly harder/more tedious than any of the general chemistry labs or more like a harder version of the same? Any advice that helped you find success in the lab would be welcome as well. I tried reading the syllabus but it was like a mountain of information and I'm hoping the key assignments required of us will be better deciphered during the first week lecture. <eos> \n","<bos> Hey y'all, let me mooch off your knowledge for a bit, I've got software at 10am in Dreese lab everyday, all my classes are near there too.

I was very happy when someone from the bullwinlkes staff contacted me through a fb message on my phone saying they had it. However, I have to wait till they re-open on Thursday to pick it up. I'm required to drive a few miles away for one of my classes and I need to be able to contact others regarding that class. So not having these two items kind of fucks me. I emailed them and sent a fb message yesterday but no response yet. If they don't reply am I just out-of-luck till Thursday? Or is there a point at which someone is working at Bulls and I could go see if I could grab my phone?

I bought two student tickets from the facebook page, and I was wondering about the process. I will use my roommate's buckID to get her in, but he is a guy, so it's a little sketchy. This isnt a problem for football games because they don't check the buckID pictures, but will this be a problem for the basketball game? Anyone have a situation like this before?

Anonymous (to you) football player - Barber - Random internet person - Internet where no one tells lies. My barber cuts the hair of an OSU football player.

And apparently, Jimmy Page knows about them and thinks they are the closest to the real thing.  I doubt there are too many college students who're into this genre.

A couple months ago (around March/April) I received a couple emails from OSU about what to do after graduation but i sort of just brushed it off figuring it was a flub in the system. Then this morning I received an email from the Newark branch saying that they have my Associates degree ready to be picked up whenever I'm ready. I'm enrolled for my fall semester classes (on columbus campus) and everything else seems to be in order, and i'm not really sure how to approach fixing this. Any advice would be helpful, gracias.

I was awarded Maximus ($4000) and a grant for $1,250 in my financial aid statement when it came out a few weeks ago (in addition to a small subsidized and unsubsidized loan) but those were all given because OSU had the impression my dad was making ~$100,000 a year.  Is there any way to contact them and hopefully get a little more money? Should I email, or call, or even go visit them in person? I’m extremely distressed right now and any advice would truly help.

However, OSU fits me better, is better academically, and is closer to home. I thought that since I got in I would just go to OSU but everyone on here seems to always hate on the school.

So now I'm stuck with no AEV, and two students who barely speak English (one of them is extremely lazy as an added bonus). I spoke with the professor briefly, and will have a long conversation with the GTA Monday, but I have genuine concerns about completing this project. The member that is no longer with the group was the productive one (next to me), and we were barely pulling it together as is. I'm not sure how we are going to complete this. Has anyone known or had experience of a group breaking up midway through? If so, what were the steps to accomplish this? I would rather join another group than stay in this current situation. And if I have to stay, what are the steps/ shortcuts to completing this project/ documentation? At this point I don't care about 3D printing or a interesting design, I just want to make it as easy as possible. NOTE: This situation is real. There's a dispatch article on the arrest.  <eos> \n","<bos> Chem 1210 Custom Edition w/ Study Guide Comm 1100 Custom Edition  Math 1150 Custom Edition <eos> \n","<bos> Is there anywhere on campus that has autodesk inventor or revit?

I'm looking for somewhere in the vicinity of koffolt labs/caldwell lab area to take a nap monday/wednesday/friday from 12:30 to 2:30 if I don't have homework.

I was wondering if anyone had taken easy GE's in these categories? <eos> \n","<bos> I'm enrolled in some cool classes this semester but all the ands and ors in the prereq slot make me think I don't actually meet them. I realize they have a system that shouldn't allow me to sign up for something that I'm not supposed to, but you know you can never 100% trust things like that. It makes me nervous because THREE of my classes are like this. For example here is one of the prereq descriptions: Prereq: 2231 or 321, and 2321 or Math 366, and CSE 2421, 360, or ECE 2560 (265), and CSE 2451, 459.21, or 459.22, and second level writing course. I have not taken CSE 2451, and if I follow the ands and ors correctly, I shouldn't be allowed to take this class, right? Should I trust this? <eos> \n","<bos> Could anyone that has taken ECE 2060 tell me how strictly the lab reports are graded?  <eos> \n","<bos> I'm having trouble finding this info online, but I'm applying to graduate school for a Master's in CSE, and need to address my letter of intent to the appropriate person.

I do not live near Ohio and did not have a chance to visit. I love the large amount of OOS students and am a big sports fan. I have a few questions: 1. How hard is it to get the National Buckeye Scholarship? My stats qualify me, but is it really competitive? 2. How is the food on campus? Is getting the unlimited meal plan worth it? 3. How hard is it to get football season tickets? I'm assuming very hard because Ohio State is one of the premiere college football programs. 4. I have also been accepted to the University of Georgia. Would you rather go to Ohio State? Why? 5. OT, but does Columbus generally lean for Cleveland or Cincinnati sports? Does Columbus lean towards the Indians/Browns or the Bengals/Reds?

Rent is normally $440 but I’ll cover a portion of it so I’m asking $300/month, prorated if you move in/out mid-month. It’s a 5 bedroom house located about a quarter-mile from campus and there will be 1-3 other guys living there during that time, depending on who stays after graduation. The apartment is fairly nice by university district standards and has a new oven/stove, new heating/air-conditioning unit, and washer/dryer in the basement. There is ample street-side parking available right in front of the house. My room is on the second floor and is 12.5 x 12 with a 3 x 6 closet. If you’d like, it can come furnished. PM me for pictures or additional info.     Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> You know those kids who get a 13 on a midterm? Well, that was me on this last midterm. I need some advice on what to do right now. Should I drop the class and take a W or is it worth working my ass off to pull of a C- or something with the curve from now on and just use grade forgiveness? I know what I did wrong; I was extremely distracted and did not study one bit, and skipping lecture didn't help.

The University has the most noble of intentions with this policy, although I do disagree with some of the implementation. There is a subtle undercurrent of shaming and condescension that accompanies initiatives like this, but perhaps that's unavoidable. Smokers who want to quit, I wish you the greatest of success. Smokers who don't want to quit, I promise not to come over to you and politely explain the dangers of smoking.

Its very nice and I image the owner would like it back. Left it with my instructor, but I'm guessing the last class was not a cse class, so said owner might not think to check with the cse department. Help get this back to its owner!

I'm looking into majoring in nursing. I'm a half black, half German male in a ~90k income family. My GPA is a 3.6 weighted which isn't great but my high school is pretty competitive (silver medal school), 28 ACT but taking again in September hoping for a 29. 4 honors classes, 4 AP classes, 1 IB, 1 college credit plus class through Columbus State. 6.5 science credits, 3 foreign language credits, 5 math credits, 4 social science credits.

Four years of varsity lacrosse and I should be a captain this year, NHS member, German Club, Interact Club (volunteering), MEDS Club (medicine interest group), freshman mentor, JSA (student political club), about 100 hours of volunteering, shift lead at my job. Please share any advice with me! EDIT: also will be the first in my family to achieve a bachelors, although my father has an associates.

I see the minimum accepted EPHR for ME is a 2.8. I'm retaking Physics 1251 at Columbus State this semester, and as long as I'm A-B range, my EPHR will be well into the 3's.

I've taken a few courses in Java at my previous school (intro, linear data structure, and a 6 month co-op), and have transfer credit for CSE 2221, so 2231 is the next in the sequence. I'm very familiar with Java. As a precaution, I'm working through all the projects posted on the 2221 website to become familiar with the OSU components library and course style.  Am I crazy to attempt to jump right into 2231 this spring? Let me know what you think. Thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm not sure where to go with this.

I scheduled a time with her (which was today at 11:15) and she just didn’t get online to answer the call. I kept my computer open all day just incase she forgot or something, I emailed her, and I even messaged her through Skype just incase my profile wasn’t clear enough as to who I was and she never responded. I rebooted my internet and Skyped someone else just to make sure it wasn’t my computer. This isn’t the first case of her not being timely. So we have discussions twice a week. Our professor is supposed to post the discussion prompts on Monday and then again on Thursday at 9am; they are then due Wednesday and also Saturday at midnight. Last week, our prof didn’t post the prompts until mid-afternoon on Saturday and gave us 24 hours to complete them, even though we’re supposed to have 3 days. She also didn’t tell us why they were late or even acknowledge it for that fact, she just kind of expected us to catch on. It’s taken her 3 weeks to post any grades. I also emailed her at the start of the term for clarification on something, and that took her four days, and another email sent from me, for her to respond. Like, what do I do in this situation? Do I email someone? I’m hella frustrated.  <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone here lived in the Visual and Performing Arts learning community in Baker Hall West?

We saw that there was a large response to your Hackathon at the library in November, so we wanted to invite CSE students to compete for large prizes! In case you don't know, hacking is an opportunity to create anything you want: mobile apps, web apps, hardware projects, etc! For 36 hours at UIUC, we want hackers of all skill levels to join us! Whether you know one programming language or twenty, you're invited! The best part - it's free for university students. And if there's enough people from OSU, there will be a free bus. So tell all of your friends and tell any interested clubs for us! We currently have 700 registrations - put your .edu email into [hackillinois.org]([url link] and RSVP to our [Facebook event]([url link] to sign up now!

I need a student that will be able to help me accomplish the goals I listed below, and to assist with some functions in the warehouse which would include; data input, auditing orders, inventorying product, and possibly some other tasks in the warehouse.

Conduct time studies on current picking process, and inventory management program, to help establish baselines for performance expectations.

What tends to be the trend is doubles especially on North Campus become partially full because singles with low numbers fill them halfway without finding a roommate first, so then you have a large number of half full doubles making it hard for pre-made pairs to room together. The other big issue is groups of four filling 6-person suites and leaving two rooms open in their suite so a good option for pairs who can’t get a double together is often to fill in one of these 6-man suites. We had friends who wanted a 6-man on North, but ended up only having options available on South campus by the time they picked at ~3,500. Just wanted to give this information from last year’s lottery to provide some perspective as to where your number might line up, but it could be completely different this year as well. <eos> \n","<bos> From overwork and muscle strain, eventually leading to muscle deterioration.

I applied to the Civil Engineering major this fall and have been conditionally accepted into the major pending my grades this semester. However, when I try to schedule the first CE classes (2050,2090) for the spring semester, it wont let me and says I have not met the pre req of being in the major. Is there something else I have to do in order to be able to schedule these classes? Im under the impression that there should be no problem, the only thing I can think of is that the department hasnt updated my status yet or something.

We have conducted noise assessment reviews, and it has been determined that with windows closed and drapes pulled, there should be little-to-no noise or lighting impact. It is also recommended that on the nights of pours that students keep their air conditioners on; with the white noise, there should be virtually no noticeable construction noise inside the halls.  Whoever is running these studies needs to adjust their equipment. 30dB reduction ear plugs and I can hear this concrete pour plain as day.  <eos> \n","<bos> I will pay top dollar for Ben Shapiro tickets, please message me ASAP <eos> \n","<bos> Hello All!

I'm thinking I'd like to take a class at C-State during the spring semester, but I want to get some input before I do it. I've heard Math 2173 isn't as bad as 1172, but I've heard Physics 1251 is a shit show. Would it be a bad idea to flip flop subjects like this or should I continue taking calc at C-State? I'm just trying to increase my chances of getting into Mechanical Engineering when I apply this spring and to keep my scholarship.

Con: The bedroom opening up for the next lease is the tiniest of the bedrooms.

The house itself is right behind Buckeye Donuts, and my room is the largest room on the third floor of the house. Washer and dryer are in the house, and the 4 other guys who live here are all pretty cool.  Less than half a block away from campus, nice location - rent is $720 a month. If you're interested in swapping leases/rooms to a pet friendly place send a PM and let's see if we can work something out. I can pay a month's rent upfront, or pay the difference between what this place costs and what you're willing to pay, as well as provide moving services/labor. I suppose my hope is that somebody isn't satisfied with their living situation and wants a spot near campus, or perhaps some new friends.  Total shot in the dark here, what's likely going to end up happening (if I can't find anybody willing to take me up on this offer) is that I'm going to have to take her to a friends place, and then my parent's house when break comes around (out-of-state student).

Sophomore here taking CSE 2221 right now and am taking 2231 and 2321 in the upcoming Summer. I wanted to ask the current students who are pursuing a BS in CSE just as I am if the classes you take are all just Software or if there is also Hardware classes? I originally decided to do CSE because i love modifying and enhancing computer and video game hardware. But then i realized i'm pretty good at coding and ended up liking it too. Did i take the wrong major? lol. Let me know what you guys have to say! EDIT: I did some looking around on the Electrical  Computer Engineering Department website and found that there is the Computer Engineering Program of Study. I am now seriously considering this transition. I'd love to hear what people have to say on this. EDIT EDIT: I have decided to stick with CSE because it would take me an extra year to catch up with the ECE classes i would have to take. For Technical Electives only 8 have to be in CSE and 7 others can be taken from other areas approved by an advisor, so maybe i could find a few ECE classes to fulfill those electives. <eos> \n","<bos> Got a flyer in the Oval encouraging me to vote no on issue 2.

This is without a doubt the worst class I've taken here. As an engineering major, I'm always excited to take a class that's outside of my field, to break up the solid math and physics. I took theatre voluntarily, and I couldn't be more unhappy with it. I have nothing against the actual class, but Ms. Lee failed completely as an instructor. It feels like she makes the class harder on purpose. No notes or slides are posted online, because she knows otherwise her lecture would be empty, since she reads straight off her slides and doesn't provide anything additional. She also doesn't make the past quizzes available to study from, even though she clearly states that she takes questions from them for the exam.  Professor Lee also takes every opportunity to turn even the most innocent subject into some sort of social commentary. A good half of her lectures turn into a discussion of feminism. I am all about gender equality, and I don't feel like I should be lectured about something I already agree with. If I wanted to take a class on feminism, I would do so. Lastly, she has no classroom awareness. Lecture is in Independence, with a couple hundred people at least. Yet she still will pout and complain if anyone is having a conversation in class, and even get angry if anyone tries to leave even a minute early. I understand that this is disrespectful, but as a professor I think you should be able to deal with these realities of lecturing hundreds of students at a time, not put class on hold and yell at the students as a whole. If anyone took this class and disagrees with me, I welcome comments. I'm just very discouraged with this class and I can't believe a university like ours would employ such an immature and inept professsor. <eos> \n","<bos>  [url link] If you’d like to search a specific address check out this map: [url link]   <eos> \n","<bos> I'm graduating this semester with no definite plans yet besides \"apply to some school sometime in the future and maybe land a 'real job' at some point'\".

I am looking at the gateway apartments on south or the flats on norwich but am willing to live other places. I would just prefer places that are nice and newer. Im 19, male, going to be a sophomore, bio major (premed). You can leave a comment or message me if you are interested. Edit: Would prefer someone who likes to lift so we can go workout together. <eos> \n","<bos> I wanna do Poli Sci 145 as a 4th class, but the lecture time doesn't work with me.

I've quite literally fucked up in the fact that I'm retaking it using grade forgiveness on a C+ I had gotten last semester. The worse I'll do is a C but unless I crush this final i'm realistically looking at a C+ (again). Both professors focused on completely different aspects of ochem (previous professor had a hard on for mech's) but it honestly only explains my performance on MT1 which i got slightly above the 73% average. MT2 came around and i bombed the shit out of it, up to that time there were family issues going on at home which distracted me significantly. I was advised by my adviser to petition for a withdraw for a different class which i preformed just as poorly on ( Basically when things got bad at home i bombed two midterms at the time, the week before i had gotten 102% on a midterm for a different class). The petition was approved but this freed up time to focus on ochem and do better came a little late, the holes just too deep and once the petition was approved I only had 2 weeks to now. I've prepared a lot for this exam but I'm stressed out. I'll stop my caffeine induced rambling but i was on track for at least a B in the course until MT2. With a high probability of a C+ i just don't see how i can explain to adcoms why i did just as poorly in a retaken class. I don't see my application to MD schools being even the slightest bit competitive now and the fact I'm retaking and most likely doing just as bad means it wont help in a DO application either. I've learned a lot on what I lacked and where my faults were in how i went about studying etc so the retake wasn't a complete loss personally but none of that matters in an application to med school. Any advice/outside prospective on what to do? Any and all comments are encouraged, I'd love to hear what you guys think! <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone else on or off campus lose powr?  <eos> \n","<bos> Fuck group projects, fuck them all. <eos> \n","<bos> 1. If you're flying solo, please select a room with another single occupant before taking an empty double. We don't need groups of two getting locked out of doubles because nobody wants to be the guy to jump in with a random roommate. Not like you're going to get an unofficial single anyway, Housing will probably just throw a freshman in there if nobody picks it. Mostly mentioning this because I honestly would probably do it myself if I didn't have a roommate lined up.     2. In a similar vein, don't take empty suites if you can't more or less fill them. I get the impression there are a lot more large group than there are suites, so let's try and let as many of those groups get suites that fit them as possible. So if you're a group of 3, either get a 4-person suite or a few doubles; don't hog a suite that could fit 6 or 8 because there are undoubtedly a bunch of 6 - 8 person groups that are eyeing those.    I know there are some people that want the humanities types to stay South and let the engineers have North, but I think that's a load of bullshit. Don't want to go back to the old North campus where it's a bunch of engineers not talking to each other.   EDIT: I hope I'm getting downvoted because I'm a freshman numnuts and not because you all intend on violating these guidelines.   EDIT2: Well I just selected housing and it looked like you numnuts violated these guidelines hard. Hopefully housing puts in some rules next year, especially point 1. <eos> \n","<bos> Hi all, I'm running into a very tight spot financially and it would be really helpful to be able to access some of my Grad PLUS loans to get me through the next month and a half...but I'm not sure how late I can still accept them? Anybody know? EDIT: To clarify I'm a full-time grad student graduating this semester. <eos> \n","<bos> I've still got an hour and a half until the deadline, but I'm just curious.

The response window is between January and March, but seeing as it's rolling admission I'm curious to know when the various rounds of acceptances have went out.

Is it even worth showing up to the final? I heard that a professor can give you an EN rather than an E, has this happened to anyone? I really don't see a point of going to the final if I can't even pass.  Also I was thinking of retaking this course at another college. Is that possible or will OSU force me to take it here? <eos> \n","<bos> I went and looked at a 1 bed property on 77 E 7th Ave with Hometeam properties. I really liked the apartment, it was really nice and big. But they were 10 minutes late to my showing so I called them and they sent someone over for a total of 16 mins late. Does anyone have experience with this company? Are they good, alright, or should I avoid them at all cost even if the place is nice? They also could not give me a quote on utilities, does anyone have a 1 bed place with them (or has had one) and could give me an estimate for utilities (water, gas, electric, etc.)? Or even if anyone has experience with renting this specific property that would be great! <eos> \n","<bos> I am purchasing some student tickets for this weeks upcoming game.

Since we're awfully close to the semester starting I had all my financial aid ready weeks ago. With my maxed out Staffords and a hefty Parent PLUS (along with a few grants/scholarships) I had my finances in order for another year. Last night I decided I'd check my school email on my phone and was told my financial aid had been updated on Wednesday. I logged into buckeyelink and was greeted with [this]([url link] Although I would be very happy to play baseball for the $18,000 I don't think it was intended for me. I really hope this doesn't screw up my financial aid as a couple of my loans are now missing (don't know why they decided to keep the unsubsidized over the subsidized.) I'll talk to Student Services about getting everything back in order. There's probably some baseball player out there freaking out because his money isn't being listed. Thought you'd all get a kick out of this. I'm going to tell everyone that I got offered a scholarship to play baseball at Ohio State :P <eos> \n","<bos> I moved to Columbia, SC from Charlotte, NC.

The homework questions are extremely difficult and don't have the answers online (unless I buy Chegg). For people that have taken this class in the past, do you have any tips? Is this known to be a difficult class? Is the textbook essential to success?  <eos> \n","<bos> After the incredible happenings last night, which i really should have attended, I'm wondering how it will affect tonight.

A little about myself, I will be a senior next year and am an Atmospheric Science major. I am pretty chill, obsessed with college/NFL football, and enjoy an occasional party but am not a hard core partier by any stretch. My current roommate is graduating and most of my friends already have plans for next year.  The apartment is located within walking distance to north campus (3 blocks north of Lane) and is right next to Tuttle Park and the Olentangy Bike Trail. The unit also has off-street parking and laundry facilities within the building. The apartment itself is spacious with large bedrooms and a large living area. The lease would be from August 1, 2015 - July 31, 2016. Rent will be $680 a month which includes unlimited use of all utilities (Electric, Gas, Water, Cable, Internet). I really enjoy living here, I feel that both the location and the management group are excellent. Please let me know if you are interested, want more information, or know someone who would be interested. Thanks!  <eos> \n","<bos> Freshman whose going to be living on campus who has a few questions regarding dorms. Only north campus answers please 1. If I want to quad, where should we apply for? Which dorms have nice quads and not shitty ones? 2. If I want to just double, where should I apply for? What are the nicer dorms that aren't impossible to get into as a freshman? 3. On the housing application, do you just write down your top 3 preferences or how does it work? Pretty much, I have no idea about any of the dorms there and the differences between them. I don't know which ones are nice that I should apply to that aren't impossible to get into (I really don't want to be thrown on west). I know this reddit generally doesn't like the classic freshman questions like this, but it'd be much appreciated if I could get some help.  <eos> \n","<bos> is that just for the graduating students?

That's a 34/40 but on the first midterm I screwed up with a 29/40 because I didn't have enough time to do the problems. I have an 83% rn with the bonus but I need at least an A/A-. I underestimated this class thinking it was going to be an easy A with all the reviews on ratemyprofessor.com but Buser is extremely stubborn with his ways of teaching. Has anyone who's taken this class before comment on the difficulty of the Final in relation to the midterms? Did you end up with an A in the class? I need at least a 26/30 <eos> \n","<bos> I'm wait listed in two classes this semester. I'm pretty confident I'll get in since I'm #1 for both.

SCE is a resource for people who have been sexually harassed or assaulted or need to talk about something like that. For reasons still unknown, it is under review and osu expects people who used this as a resource to call CCS or SARNCO or some other source. Well CCS here is shit. They are always backed up and don't have enough time to give everyone the time that they need and deserve. SARNCO is backed up as well and what can they do about the problems here on campus. What if the victim is in the same class as the perpetrator? They can't do anything about that. SCE can but that resource is no longer there. Also, osu didn't even put out a statement about the investigation when it started. Seriously OSU. I'm so disappointed.

I've tried calling, but the machine told me that there was a high volume of calls and to try later. Given that response, I tried to schedule online, but was met with a window that said I needed to have filled out a form from the Health Center to use that feature.

So I'm beginning to plan my schedule for next semester (I'm a first year) and I was wondering if the sororities on campus all meet on the same night? And if they do, what night/time is it? I have friends at other schools who are missing their first semester of meetings because they unknowingly scheduled classes for the same time and I'm hoping to avoid that.  Also - do you recommend joining sororities? I'm on the fence. I plan on going through recruitment because it seems like a good thing to do. However, I'm worried about it a bit. I've been struggling socially, mainly because I didn't join the party scene and struggle with some anxiety issues. I'm hoping a sisterhood will help, but will those issues cause more problems if I'm in a sorority? I know they get a bad rap on campus, but I'm wondering how much of that is made up/over exaggerated?  <eos> \n","<bos> Title says it all, basically.

The apartment is a large 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom duplex (2500 sq ft) one block east of High Street in Clintonville, rent for the room is a steal at ONLY $290. Utilities not included, but usually range from $50-$100, depending on the season. For the price and location, it just doesn't get any better. Access to the Olentangy bike trail and COTA bus line that takes you directly to campus are just two blocks away. If you have a car, there is ample street parking (no permit required). Less than a half a mile walk to Kroger, Walhalla Ravine, Glen Echo Park, Cornerstone Cafe, Dough Mama, Local Cantina, Lineage Brewery and Bonchon.  In addition, we have a covered front porch, fenced in back yard with fire pit, WD hook-ups and a full basement if you need extra storage. Our neighbor is a sweet retired school teacher who sends us valentines and occasional treats. We don't party quite like Chittenden, but we'll still enjoy a few beverages to relax and unwind. Potential roommates must have a good level of cleanliness and sorry, no pets (unless it is a registered therapy animal)! Available for move in June through August 1st, at the very latest.

I took it last fall with the same instructors. It's a great fit for anyone who wants to learn more about insects and fill a lab science requirement. Labs were actually fun, and while there was a fair amount of workload for the class it was never anything too difficult. Drs. Anelli and Klooster are great and really nice, too.

Obviously i cant just drive around columbus because i wont be back until august, and i need a house before i go back haha. Zillow is kinda sucking in this area, so any help is much appreciated!  <eos> \n","<bos> If you bought a year-long parking pass, you can cancel it at the campusparc office and get reimbursed for the summer months. I just cancelled my C pass and got $81 back. I'm assuming they do it like that so that a large number of students forget and go home for the summer without cancelling. Fuck campusparc, get your money back.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hi, i was wondering if there is free parking on neil for the whole weekend since it is a home game weekend. if not, anywhere close by my friend can park for the weekend for free?

Its located at 100 Frambes, has a living room, good sized kitchen and additional storage space.

We can also sublease individually if you are alone and are comfortable sharing a 2 bedroom apartment.

I assumed that the class would just be dropped from my record all together and I could just pretend it never happened, like other classes I had dropped. However, after I dropped it I noticed that it was still on my buckeyelink and read that a class dropped after 12/30 would be \"retained on my academic record with a status of dropped.\" Does this actually mean anything? Like is it a bad thing? I'm guessing it's not a big deal but I just wanna make sure. Classes haven't even started so I'm confused why they'd keep it on my record already. <eos> \n","<bos> My friends and I are planning on going to osu newark together and I was wondering if it is possible for all 4 of us to live together on campus or if roomates are chosen randomly. <eos> \n","<bos> ayo what's good my bucks. anyone take this course? on a scale of stupid easy to wtf, how was it?

I also have a friend transferring from Miami and we're planning on rooming together. However housing has said that it'd be hard for us to even get in the dorms, let alone room together. So now we're looking at apartments.  I'm an engineering major, and he's premed, so I'm guessing most of our classes will be north campus. Should we be looking at dorms on South campus for the social element, and just take the bus to north campus? And does anyone have any apartment recommendations? Kind of leaning towards somewhere like Kinnear Commons.  I'm friends with a rising sophomore there and some juniors too so we'll have some people to hang out with.  <eos> \n","<bos> I just went down there a couple of days ago and there was weird random writing everywhere pictures of illuminati etc does anyone know more information/facts/interesting things about this place?  <eos> \n","<bos> My backup backup backup backup ear buds finally died.

But they said absolutely nothing about what it was, which was reason #1 for me to be suspicious. Then I went to a group interview with three other people and someone talked to us about how great an opportunity it was to paint houses all summer. It sounded like it was too good to be true and it felt pretty sketchy. I googled it and the first thing to show up was \"College Works Painting Scam\" and on their website they have an explanation of why they aren't a pyramid scheme. I can't help but think that if you have to go out of your way to explain why you're ethical you probably aren't ethical. Lastly I did more research and on every major American university's reddit page there is a post about how it is a scam so it's safe to say I'm skeptical but I am still morbidly curious. Does anyone have any experience with this group? Are they actually a great organization or are they glorified white-collar criminals? <eos> \n","<bos> Anybody heard anything about whether the Penn State game is a blackout again this year?

I am a second year and will be on a work term in Columbus next semester. I called multiple times asking how this related to my housing contract and up to today they told me I could get it waived.

When the incidents at the Union happened earlier this month, an outpouring of kindness was seen on this sub and on social media in general. Please don't let that kindness only be a reaction that fades away after things have cooled down. Keep your PMs open if you said they were. Be willing to meet with people if that's what you offered. Keep the olive branch of friendship extended if you extended it. We are all going to be under stress in some way this coming week, and acute stress can be the thing that tips a person from depressed but functional to suicidal.  You don't have to save everyone. You don't have to sit in a bathroom with someone and listen while they bawl their eyes out about how they're going to flunk out of college because of a botched final if you don't feel able. But please, please, please be polite if not kind to everyone you interact with, not just after tragedies happen. <eos> \n","<bos> so when you get a parking pass and you sign up online with your license plate to register your vehicle, how does campusparc check throughout the day?

The grades will be published today or tomorrow in SIS. We had a lot of very good grades! Recall that we do not curve per se (that is, add a number to all scores), but we do consider the class average. We take this average, subtract it from the class high score, and divide it by 6 to obtain the incremental increase for the C+ to A grade cuts. For the bottom, we start by subtracting 500 points from the average and dividing that by 4 for the incremental decrease for grades C to D. We then look for largish gaps in the total scores for our final recommended cuts (so a few points do not cost anyone a grade). The Vice Chair for Undergraduate Studies for the department compares all the 1220 classes this term and he makes the final grade cuts. It is department policy not to publish the final grade cuts. .......... If I only got 725.8 points, does this mean she's going to RAISE my grade 6.75% or decrease it by that much? I just want to know if my grade will curve up half a percent to a C.  <eos> \n","<bos> Wow, he was so cool and friendly. He did a real good job bagging the groceries for my cart.

As of last week, the University became involved in a formal contract dispute dealing with the drilling and construction of the geothermal wells.  Over the past 50 years a great deal of information about the hydrogeology, paleokarst horizons, and high yields of wells completed in the Newburg Zone within the Silurian-Devonian Carbonate Aquifer has been published in theses, dissertations, government reports, professional journals, reference books, and textbooks, all of which can be found in libraries across the state and much of it accessed via the internet.

Davis Clock Tower. The LCD screen is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the pixels will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Tom's altruistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his tower - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Michael V. Drake literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these visuals, to realize that they're not just bright- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike the Tom W. Davis Clock Tower truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the emotional profoundness in the Tower's existential catchphrase \"Thank you Tom!,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tom W. Davis's genius unfolds itself on their clock tower screen. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Tom W. Davis Clock Tower tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. <eos> \n","<bos> So I just got caught tonigr drinking in my dorm.

Our house is just north of campus on Maynard, west of High. Very easy walking access to just about all of campus.  The house is a really big 5 bedrooms and all common areas are already furnished/stocked for easy roommate adjustment. House has good A/C  heating  really big common areas for hanging out with your friends/doing whatever. We even have a huge basement we use for storage. We also have off-street parking, 50Mbps internet, 1 1/2 bathrooms  a bunch of other stuff I'm probably forgetting.  Everyone is the house is a gamer, mostly pc games but I think we also own just about every console as well. We do drink and have a couple non-rager parties we throw every year.  What we're looking for: - -Roommate for entire 2015/16 year  - August-August, We may be able to get you in sooner if you want. -Male or Female  - We will meet/talk with everyone interested to make sure they're a good fit. -Clean  - It's a big house and can get dirty very fast if everyone doesn't clean up after themselves. -Able to pay rent on time every month. -Ok with drinking/occasional parties  - Game Days can get crazy. -Social  - Everyone in the house are longtime friends, we hope you'll be our longtime friend. We're not looking for someone who is going to bring a lot of random people into our house all the time or never talk and hang out with us. Details about the House: - -Rent:  - 300 per month (might go up $10, don't know yet) -Utilities:  - $50-$100 per person depending on how cold/hot we keep it. -Fully furnished everything.  - All you would need to do is move your stuff into your room. We probably even have extra furniture if you need something.  -Location:  - North of Campus. On Maynard near Neil avenue. Short walk to North Campus and easy access to bus stops. -Other Stuff:  - Washer/Dryer in the basement. We also have all other normal appliances and a chest freezer. Also an outdoor grill for cooking, Dining tables, etc.  - Off-Street parking. I'm Interested, What do I do? - Send me a message here on Reddit and we can discuss everything. Feel free to ask me anything I forgot/didn't mention. I'll set up a time in the near future you can come to house and look around and meet the other people who will be living here next year. Decisions will then be made.  Thanks <eos> \n","<bos> I hate to say it, but general chemistry is just awful. Recitation is a waste of time as our TA does absolutely nothing the whole class (i.e: here's a worksheet, do it, bye). Don't get me started on lab (Why is a large portion of our lab grade our results? Something as little as your lab neighbor knocking over your test tube will lose you 20 points, doesn't matter if you address it in the error analysis). My lecturer is alright, though. Don't get me wrong, I love chemistry and can do stoich problems all day, however this class structure is severely inefficient and confusing. I understand many students will have different opinions with different professors/TAs but most of my friends are having similar experiences. Does it get ANY better and does the class get curved? I'm going to have to take chemistry through the 4300 series for chemical engineering (I know they get hard). <eos> \n","<bos> Let me know if you're in Lower's 2100 Intro to Environmental Science class and I can make a study group with everyone! <eos> \n","<bos> I need a new starter for my jeep and was wondering if anyone has had any good experiences with shops around campus.

I was caught and I am really not sure where things will go from here. I am not new to OSU, but I have never had to deal with the disciplinary side of the university.

One, I am not an Ohio State student or fan nor do I have any connection with your school. I actually go to another major university (doesn't matter which, it's not in the Big 10). Two, I'm not trying to start any trouble or sound dickish in this inquiry. As a frequenter of sports message boards I have seen OSU called \"THE Ohio State University\", or tOSU. Why is this? Now I guess that differentiates you from Oklahoma State University when talking about the Buckeyes on a national stage. But is there some other underlying reason or tradition for this verbiage? [Grammar, according to Yale]([url link] doesn't match up unless the school's name starts with \"University of\", not the state's name (see bottom of first section, sorry about the example they provide). Is there some unspoken traditional thing going on here? I know a lot of schools in the area, including OSU, are steeped in tradition, and maybe it has something to do with that. As far as I know, I've heard of no other schools who do this. Please enlighten me and the rest of the college sports world - thank you. <eos> \n","<bos> I know this was answered before, but I can't seem to find the post.

To get the minor, I need to take 4201 and 5301 in 1 semester, then take 4202 and 5302 in the next. <eos> \n","<bos> It's Friday at 5:30 and Curl looks like everyone cleared out hours ago. What gives?

I'm an incoming freshman and I've been invited via e-mail to apply for the SATE Internship, which takes place at the Wright Brothers Institute and the Air Force Research Lab. The internship is a paid 5 week internship, away from home. Have any OSU redditors had experience with this internship and would like to share their thoughts? Would this be a beneficial undertaking even before my first class at Ohio State?

Everyone can join, it's even better if there are multiple houses in a row blasting different music, just so we know who's really cool and who isn't. It would be a shame to keep the music at a reasonable level and contained within our own homes where our neighbors, some who are elderly, aren't able to hear it. Just an idea. <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, if anyone is a great rocket league player (I'm champion 1) and wants to team up for the collegiate tournaments, hit me up!

I got a 50% and have a D in the class. There are still two exams left, but at this point, I feel like its a lost cause. I'm wondering if its better to withdraw right now, or finish it and use grade forgiveness. I have already used forgiveness once for Math 1172 last year. Also, I am planning on going to grad school (MBA), so I don't know how they view dropped and/or retaken courses. Any advice helps. Thanks!

I got home yesteday, and not until evening, I realized I didn't have it. I looked all over my apt for it but haven't seen it.  I use a wheelchair and was yesterday sitting at one of the tables in the Dreese lobby eating lunch using my laptop, and I had to hurry off to catch a ride. The device I have misplaced is a 12 inch Macbook space gray. I have Find My Macbook enabled and have it set to lock when it appears, but it was last almost dead, and I locked it this morning not thinking about the possibility I left it on campus. As stated I realize this is an extreme longshot, but if any good semaritans out there may know anything please contact me. Thank you in advance.  <eos> \n","<bos> I just got back from winter break, and I cannot connect to wifi.

I wouldn't be posting here if I wasn't absolutely desperate, but...it's reaching that point. I'm currently working at a restaurant on the east side of High, but it's not giving me nearly enough hours (or even close to the amount I was told I'd get upon hiring, go fucking figure). I've been looking for a month now and applied several places and keep getting turned down, because nobody's looking to hire for the summer (understandable). Does anybody know about any job openings/leads? Stressing the fuck out about rent this summer and money issues next summer when I graduate... <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a closeted bi guy, but I'd like to get more involved in the LGBT community and meet others who are the same.

I'm still trying to decide where to guy, and I would love to go to OSU. However, college is going to be expensive anyway, and the ~$10,000 per year for room and board doesn't help. What worries me about commuting is losing the sense of community at college. I want to be able to hang out with my friends and not worry about getting home late. Additionally, it would be a long drive through rush hour every morning from Pickerington. Any advice? <eos> \n","<bos> Nobody else is here; if you want some quality 1 on 1 time with a large cute dog check out the fourth floor of Knowlton.

I came here his first year, and since he has not done a SINGLE thing that i like. Nothing he does AT ALL has had ANY positive impact. Now, he has the AUDACITY to go against the board and drag this bullshit out against urban meyer. Urban did absolutely nothing wrong, and it is taking a toll on the team. The entire board wants to reinstate him immediately but Drake believes there needs to be a suspension. He has time and time again proved to be against what is best for us. The next thing this board needs to vote is on his employment. I can not stand this man.  <eos> \n","<bos> How's Spanish 1155 with Evelyn Steensen?

My roomates and I have spent hours debating what it may be. It seems to be 24/7/365 and not necessarily cyclical. It is very hard to describe, but the \"pitch\" increases/decreases very rapidly for about one second. It sounds like (but cannot be) a flamboyant car ignition process mixed with an African swallow bird. **I desperately need to know. PLEASE HELP.** I live near the intersection of 15th and Indianola. <eos> \n","<bos> Long story short, my program requires a 2 credit practicum/internship over the summer. They don't even really help you find an internship or help place you. There are no seminars or classes attached to these credits. Basically, I work probably unpaid at an organization in Columbus but have to shell out $4000 to Ohio State (I am a non-resident). I feel like I am being swindled. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm thinking about taking an introductory history class during Summer (HISTORY 1101 TO 1150,1151,1152,1153).

The next part makes zero sense. After unchecking that box he said the cutoff for an A is a 57. Well I'm at a 62 right now. I highly doubt thats an A (definitely won't be after that horrible final lol). My quiz average is a 68, homework is 90, and I forgot to do a handful of prelabs and essential skill. Fortunately I got an 85 and 80 on the first 2 midterms which brings my grade to a low B right now with everything graded except for the final. I find it hard to believe that this curve would bump me up 3 grades if my grade stays around the same after the final is graded. Maybe I'm wrong. I won't be complaining if that's the case. I'm just super confused and would like some input if any of you actually understand this curve or have taken this course in the past and can let me know how big the curve generally is. Thanks <eos> \n","<bos> Due to being an OA, I have to move back to campus early (August 3rd).

There is one room available in a three bedroom apartment (Boys and girls okay) Rent is $350, there is a security deposit of $350. The sublease is until July and water is already paid for. The rest of the utilities( Gas, Internet, and Electric) are estimated to be an extra $70. there is a washer and dryer already in the unit. The other two roommates are girls.  Christy: she is about 20. Doesn't do much but plays video games.  Shannon: I don't really know much about her. She is hardly ever there. But she is a bit messy. However she is really nice and respectable.  *both theses girls are pretty laid back and really don't say much  *Also this room is not furnished at all(but i can leave the desk in there) and there is free street parking. And I also have a parking pass for parking in the back. And you have to get the GAS in your name. i was able to fit a full size bed, desk, night stand, mini fridge, chair, and storage in the room. I was also able to fit a dresser, hamper and all of my clothes in the closet. If you want to take a look at the room then please text me(216)269-7597 with your favorite color. Hope to see you soon. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a Fisher student so anything near North campus works, i just need to heat my lunches  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey all! I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I have a question. My boyfriend and I attend the University of Tennessee but are serious Ohio State fans. We're considering coming up for either Penn State or Michigan State game weekends, and would stay with family in Marysville, but we would need somewhere to tailgate before the game. Is your student body pretty welcoming? We're a fun couple, I promise, and could provide our own booze if necessary :)  <eos> \n","<bos> hey guys, anyone know what times and days Chang is lecturing 2510 next fall? or what times he's lectured 2510 in the past?

Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> I figured with how ridiculous the rental system is for off campus housing at OSU, we should use this quickly expanding subreddit to our advantages in hooking up fellow OSU redditors with some awesome places that would otherwise more than likely end up going to wanna-be Walter Whites who would more than likely cause off campus shootings at exponential levels. Do you want that kind of shit to be your fault cause you didn't let /r/osu know you were leaving your future meth lab house? Post about your place you're leaving here and help your fellow redditors out.  My roommates and I are looking for a new 3/4/5/6 bedroom house to finally get out of the clutches of Northsteppe's extreme level of shittiness. I figured the best way to get a decent place for a decent price would be to ask the community if anyone renting from a landlord of good quality is not renewing next year and would be willing to let us see the place to potentially rent it for the upcoming fall. If you are interested please send me a message. I figured rather than making a douchey advertisement post for selfish purposes I could instead make a thread that could be advantageous to the community as a whole. Don't know about you guys, but the deadlines on these renewals are ridiculously stressful. <eos> \n","<bos> What is the course number for the skydiving class? I'm looking to take it spring semester. <eos> \n","<bos> Yeah..so, I think I lost my wallet. My area of travel is confined to about 18th ave to hughes and 11th to about 9th. I also frequent Thompson library and Smith lab (for work). The wallet is a NES controller with 0 cash(cause college) and some ID's in it.

However, I've heard anecdotally that a fair amount of muggings take place there. Living west of the Olentangy (like Kinnear Commons) was suggested, but that's so darn far away from everything. Anyway, south campus people, is it moderately safe? Would you recommend living there? Edit: a lot of you are mentioning living farther away and taking the bus in. How inconvenient is that? Do you often find yourself either late or really early due to bus schedules? <eos> \n","<bos> Are Pocket knifes allowed on campus? more specifically in dorms? <eos> \n","<bos> I am planning on getting a MacBook Pro by the end of this year. Since I am on a tight budget, I was wondering if 8GB of ram and 256gb of storage sufficient to last me throughout college?  <eos> \n","<bos> So...I planned on majoring in chemistry. But I'm changing my mind since I read \"the chemistry classes are designed to make chemistry majors drop out\". Why? Why would they do that anyway?  Anyway, I'm more interested in the materials science portion anyway. Is that just as bad?  I completed over a year of college in high school through dual enrollment that should mostly transfer. Let's presume it doesn't for a second because that's not really my point. But I took chemistry classes that the average was about a 51% on each exam (or less) and received As and Bs. Is it still impossible to do chemistry here? edit: I just wanted to add that we used the same chemistry textbook as Ohio State, although not the \"OSU\" version of it. So I know the kind of things that at least Gen Chem entails.  <eos> \n","<bos> Error in title. Apply to CSE in the fall (next semester) I went and talked to my advisor about this and she basically said that the process of switching from CIS to CSE next semester will just be a form with your name and email exactly for this purpose. If you're like me and can't apply to CSE until next semester and are worried about the bump to a 3.2 gpa, apply to CIS!! cse.osu.edu - current students - majors - application to major Edit: to be clear, applying to CSE (which is very simple as a CIS major) as a CIS major next semester bypasses the 3.2 gpa requirement. <eos> \n","<bos> The instructors where not told about this.

I'm currently in University Exploration and was going for Finance, but I'm leaning heavily towards the financial advisory path versus working in corporate finance, so I thought this might be a better option since I could get my CFP and my Bachelors at the same time. I was a little surprised to see that this major isn't a Fisher major, can anyone attest to the quality of this program? Bonus points for someone that's working in the industry already.  ALSO, if anyone has taken 3940 Consumer Information: Methods of Data Analysis OR 2260 Family Financial Management, I have some questions about those as well.

I'm a 4th year Cog Neuro Major with minors in CIS and Eng Sci. I've really come to love the cross roads of artificial intelligence and neuroscience and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for someone with these interests?

I was wondering if anyone could give some advise concerning the difficulty of the class (My math background is only 1151, 1152, and 2153). I've been reading Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience to prepare, but some of the differential equation stuff goes a bit over my head. I'll also be taking 2568 concurrently with 4350.

If you don't find the book, ask the instructor if you'd require the book, you can also rent out the book from the library for 2-5 hours. nbsp; If it's an online access code then you'd probably have to buy, the best place to first look for code only would be at eBay, most of the time with online access you get an ebook as well. nbsp; Just some tips to save you some $$.  <eos> \n","<bos> Im an incoming freshman and i just found out that i'm scheduled for calc II but the lectures will be online. there will be in class REC, but the actual lecture will be online.

I even checked the class at 11:20am and it was gone :(  Sincerely, Cold CSE student  Edit: apparently my comment isn’t showing: I asked the prof at 11:20 (my original class was 9:10-10:05) and she didn’t see any jacket  Also I asked my CSE prof today if he found a jacket, but he didn’t either  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone have class with this professor? can't find anything on rateMyProfessor. <eos> \n","<bos> So I didnt get into one of my waitlisted classes, and thus am no longer considered a full time student since in only have 10 credit hours.

This Autumn 2018 will be my first semester enrolled in the major (taken ECE 2020/2060 already though) and I want to meet other ECE students.  It would be nice to have friends that can relate in difficult times during the semester. Anyways, here's my schedule for this semester: ECE 2050, ECE 3020, ECE 3030, MATH 2415, and ISE 2040. If you are or are not enrolled in any of these courses I would still be happy to meet! <eos> \n","<bos> Just curious whether or not anyone who has previously had Buser for 4002 knows if he curves grades? I figure it's no since he offered extra credit but just curious. Also, as a side note to anyone who is going to be taking 4002 in the future: Buser isn't recommended. Enthusiastic but class is stupid boring. <eos> \n","<bos> For Donges class, does anyone remember if the midterm was initially out of 81 or did we suck  it got curved?  I’m sure we will find out on Monday but I have no patience.  <eos> \n","<bos> We are doing a fundraiser with theRubberU by selling wristbands that allow you to access discounts at several businesses around town. They have an app as well so you don't even need a wristband if you so desire. They're $10 and the savings recoup the cost pretty quickly. Here's their website for the full list of participating establishments. Just remember to use the code \"osubaseball\" or we don't get any money.

Most of the nearby hotels that I know that are nice/affordable are booked already. I heard that some people have houses in Upper Arlington that they rent out, but I don't even know where to start looking for something like that.  Additionally, if there's any advice for parking, seating in the stadium, etc., please let me know! I want to get these things figured out as soon as possible (I'm a nervous worrier) and any help is much appreciated! :) **TL;DR** If anyone has suggestions/experience with the cluster fuck we call graduation at OSU, please help! <eos> \n","<bos> its taken me a long time to adjust to osu (freshman here), and it feels like i should have gotten the hang of it already. what i mean by adjusting is mainly academic workload wise- im an engineering student and every time a midterm comes around i feel like im too stupid to be in my major. im talking to my advisor this week about changing majors and if that is something i should consider. how long did it take some of you to adjust, and how did you bounce back from a rough first few months? <eos> \n","<bos> I'm assuming it doesn't stay the same every year, but I'd like to do some 11th hour boning up so I know what I'm getting into for sure.

Last spring and fall, the OSU Restroom Review was a useful and comical resource for many Redditing buckeyes. Check out bathrooms all over campus and read what your classmates have to say about them.

My class rank is 24/134 (top 18%). My only extracurricular activities include a part-time job I have had for the last year and a half and one year of JV basketball. My SAT score is a 1370. Is it even worth applying and do I have a chance at the Buckeye scholarship? I would only be able to attend if I am awarded the National Buckeye Scholarship.   Also, my planned major would be aviation.  Thanks <eos> \n","<bos> Why am I deciding to disclose this information on /r/osu?

Clearly 5000 course maybe harder but if I drop 5140 I need to take 4 upper division course next sem(while drop 3820 only requires 3), fortunately it won't increase my total hour next sem. So I really need some suggestions <eos> \n","<bos> I'm in the college of engineering if that helps. The homework was due forever ago and he finally just posted the grades today. I have a 10/10 on the first homework and a 0 on the second. I emailed them like crazy and they said they can't find it. I have no proof that I did it other than my word because they've posted the solutions since then.  Is there anyway I can defend myself or am I screwed? If they absolutely refuse to believe me is there anyone higher up I can go to? I'm freaking out. I worked really hard on that shit.  Edit: undergrad grader admitted he lost some papers and I got credit. TIL it's not a bad idea to make some form of backup of important assignments.  <eos> \n","<bos> So my girlfriend was thinking about coming down to visit me tonight since we have a snow day and I am looking for a place where she could park for free without being ticketed.

If you answer yes to either of these questions, where you planning on studying abroad (studying abroad currently is great too!) or aiming to move to overseas?  If anyone studied abroad, what was the experience like? For me, I'm hoping to move to the UK after graduation, but it may end up failing depending on the sponsorship for the visa going through and having enough money to move. Just hoping for the best at this point. Hope to hear about your experiences or goals :). <eos> \n","<bos> To start off, I did really bad in my first semester and got a 1.5 GPA and was placed on probation. Im currently in my 2nd semester and hoping to increasing my Cumulative GPA to 2.0. In worst case scenario, I couldn't and my Cumulative GPA is slightly below 2.0 which is 1.90+.

Things were great and I had a few different circles of friends. Somewhere in the past year and half, everything started going to shit. I fell into depression, was smoking everyday, failed some classes and had to take a semester off. Now I'm living on the edge of the OSU map (chit) and I only have two classes on campus, netheir of which are the \"talk to the person next to you type\" or so it feels that way. I feel so out place trying to reach out to old dorm friends and I've been so genuily lonely due to borderline depression and family issues that I don't know how to make new friends anymore. This kills me cause I use to be so social before 22. I'm getting older and can't go out as much cause of school and work. I get that I can't keep partying as much as one does freshmen/sophomore year. But it feels like I shouldn't be sitting in my room everyday having an existential crisis every couple of days ethier.  How do I find new friends when all my current friends are stoners, or how can I learn to be social more often? Any in depth advice in general would be nice. Thanks fellow Buckeyes <eos> \n","<bos> As an off-campus student what are some of the rental properties around South campus?

For example, if I take a dance class that counts for the \"Cultures\" and \"US Diversity\" requirements, would both of those boxes be checked, or would it only count as one requirement? Edit: Thank you for your responses! They helped me get a plan before I talked to my advisor today! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm taking 1251 with Barrett right now. Has anyone taken him for 1251 in the past, and know how much he generally curves the final grades? I took 1250 with a different professor, and the grades were curved enough so that my 72 in the class was enough for a B. I'm hoping Barrett does something similar. <eos> \n","<bos> So I am currently in Bio 1114, Chem 1220, and Stats 2480 and wanted to see if anybody on here has those and wants to study sometime.

You will have your own bedroom but share a bathroom with one other person.  There are two guys and one girl living her currently, all seniors, and we don't care which gender our roommate is (you will be sharing the bathroom with the girl, but if that is a problem we can do a little room juggling as all rooms are identical).  We are all pretty quiet while home and spend most of our time either out or in our respective rooms (what would you expect from a redditor?). We'd prefer someone who is similar. We don't care if you are a partier, just don't be too obnoxious here (of course, we are reasonable).  As the title says, we are looking for someone to move in asap, but if you can't move in until Spring semester still reply in case we can't find anyone sooner. Feel free to reply to this post or pm me. <eos> \n","<bos> What's a really good focus for the major with the best career outcomes (easier to get into)? Any CSE majors out there can describe the various focuses for this major would be helpful. So far, I'm leaning towards either Database Admin, OS development, or Computer Graphics (Game Programming). Sadly, my advisor didn't have much input on these fields as far as courses needed. I'm pretty sure for OS you need A.I., Security, Network Programming, and others. Any input would be helpful :) <eos> \n","<bos> With the year starting soon, I'm looking to try and find some OSU wear outside of the usual brand shirts you see at a lot of places.

Everyone has said that OSU's chemistry program is ridiculously hard and I'll be lucky if I pass. Is this true?

I have a few emails out to track down a POLITSC 1200 - Comparative Politics Syllabus from 2015 but thought I'd try the great OSU redditors as well Thanks for any help! <eos> \n","<bos> I'll be starting a masters program at OSU this upcoming fall, and travelling to Columbus in April to look at different apartment complexes, so I was wondering if I could get some input at what places to look. I have a car and am not opposed to living further out and driving to campus daily (I'll have access to a B parking pass). It might actually be preferable, since I'm not straight out of undergrad and not really looking to extend the undergrad lifestyle, haha. I'm preferably looking for 1 bedrooms, but studios aren't totally out of the question either.  I'd appreciate input on management companies or even just neighborhoods in general. My advisor has given me some input, so it seems like I'd want to stick to west of campus. No pets, so that isn't an issue either.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey Buckeyes.    I'm looking to return to school to get a BS in CSE at Ohio State. I'm just curious about your thoughts on the program, things you wish you'd known beforehand, any programming languages you wish you'd spent more time on, etc. Oh and good professors or ones to avoid.    Also, I'm curious about the textbooks being used for the Java and C++ courses.    Thanks a ton. <eos> \n","<bos> I know finals week brings havoc to the meager amount of study space on campus. Especially when you are trying to group study and need a place where you can talk to each other, it is even worse. So I am going to post some of my knowledge of the spaces I discovered, so please contribute. Good luck on all your exams! 1. Orton geology library (till 5) 2. Smith lab 1st floor study room 3. Smith lab classrooms. Go to 4th or 5th floor, just go into an empty classroom. 4. Cockins hall 1st floor and 2nd floor MSLC tutor rooms (just go in one- just sit in the corner and work on what ever you have) 5. Kennedy commons (12th ave bread company) basement has lots of rooms and desks in the hall. Also, the loft over the bread company has desks and you can study there too. 6. Go into a dorm (you don't have to live there) and use the study rooms there. 7. Go to the 2nd floor of McDonalds on High street. They don't care. Just buy a coke and you're good. 8. There is a long bench on 1st floor of McPherson if deskless your thing. 9. The health and sciences library 10. Just go into an empty room in Mason Hall 1st floor. You might get kicked out though. 11. Mason hall also has a circular room next to rohr cafe. Try it out. If your lurk enough, you can find spots in Thompson and SEL, but group study or trying to sit with someone else is impossible... So there, I hope this helps. And really, Cockins is really good. Just try not to walk past a greeter since they'll ask you to sign in. Just find an empty room and walk in. I write this from cockins :) Please contribute! <eos> \n","<bos> Hi, I have 2 questions about this particular textbook.  So I took calc 1151 last semester and it required this textbook. I rented it not knowing that I would need it again in math 1172. Does anybody know if any future math classes also require this textbook? If not, I will rent it again. But if I need it yet again in the future, it would be cheaper for me to buy it outright.  Also, does anybody happen to know if it is substantially different than the non-osu custom edition? If it is similar enough, I can just get the ebook online and pirate the vanilla version.  <eos> \n","<bos> Found an OSU ID just outside the parking lots near the JO South.

I had some personal issues if my own that included depression and a resulting drug problem that made doing school extremely hard for me. I took a basic class in the summer and got a 4.0 which raised my gpa to 2.6. In the fall semester I tried once again to do engineering and came up short and got sent to coam for a homework assignment. After that semester I was put on special action probation and needed a 2.3 in the spring semester. Right now I’m looking at finishing with a 2.26 and I’m freaking out about whether or I’ll be dismissed. I turned my life around after the fall semester and relatively ended my drug problem and started to make strides in school, but my track record here is bad. If I end up not finishing above a 2.3 am I definitely going to get kicked out? I’ve never had to deal with something like a drug problem and depression and I tried to fix it in time but I’m worried I don’t fix it in time.  <eos> \n","<bos> I was originally planning on taking 4 hours of summer classes but switched down to 3, so I am expecting a $450 refund but haven't received it yet.

This summer, she and I made necklaces out of beads and buckeye nuts while her little brother napped. I used it to reinforce the lessons on patterns in between the buckeye nuts (some necklaces would have a scarlet-gray-scarlet-gray pattern, others would have scarlet-scarlet-gray-gray).  So now we have extra necklaces and I thought it'd be fun for her to try to sell them as though it was a lemonade stand. How much do they typically cost?

Does anyone know when you receive refund checks from the university? Some call them \"overage\" checks.

She wouldn't teach half of the time or would go completely off topic. I tried studying for it (2221) using the slides but there's only so much that the slides can help with!

My current gpa is 3.41, recovering after a 3.0 my first semester last fall.  No excuses for my poor performance, but long story short I recieved a C- in math 1148. Now, a C- is the minimum grade to move on to the next course in the sequence, 1131 (business calc) which I am currently enrolled in for this fall. I am confident that I have learned many things in the past year that leave me much more equipped to perform as a student, therefore I anticipate a much better grade in business calc. My question, though, is if I have to take 1148 over because I earned a C-.  This is directly from the Fisher website : \"Completion of Math 1131 or 1151 or equivalent and prerequisites with grades of C or better\". So if I received an A or B in 1131 and end the semester with, at the lowest, a 3.5 GPA, will I even be able to apply? I hesitate to ask Fisher themselves as if I did continue and performed well in 1131, I would not even be able to retake 1148 because of the higher credit.  Am I even allowed to retake a C-? Even if it allows me on to the next course?  Also, is it possible for a current \"non-Fisher student\" to talk to a business advisor? It wouldn't allow me to schedule an appointment.  Thanks for your time and help. Go bucks.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys. Trying to pack on some muscle this year so I'm looking for a dedicated workout partner. I find I push myself a lot harder when I lift with a friend/spotter. It's also great having the accountability of a lifting partner to carry each other through lapses in motivation. If this sounds like your thing then comment/pm me and we can talk more.  I like going most evenings around 8/9/10 when the gyms are less crowded. Usually go to RPAC but open to JO north and ARC as well. I have a garage pass and am open to carpooling if convenient. More details: M/26/6'1/175lbs. Currently doing a 3 day push/pull/legs+shoulders split with lots of volume and I run 10mins or so at the end. I'm a very laid back grad student/ future mass monster.  Last thing: I am recovering from a spinal injury so I'm avoiding lower-back intensive lifts for the time being. i.e. if you like spending half of every workout squatting we prob won't be a great match.  Not turned off yet? Hit me up  <eos> \n","<bos> When are these gonna be up??

We are looking for any 21+ student who would like to become a part-time bartender to work the weekend shifts. * No experience is necessary. * We only serve beer (no cocktails or wine), so it's quite easy. * Any knowledge or enthusiasm for beer is a bonus. * You would make minimum wage ($4.15/hr for tipped employees), but the tips are pretty great since it's only 1 bartender/shift. Tips typically range from $100-$200, but can be better or worse depending on the night. It's the service industry - so the more charm the better! * Shifts include: Fridays 4-10p, Saturday 12-5p and 5-11p, Sunday 12-6p. * Need to work 1 shift/weekend minimum. The more the better. * Start date: ASAP * Duration of employment: we would ideally like to hire someone who is willing to work throughout the school year.  Please comment if you are interested, and we can iron out the details. Edit: added some info regarding hours, shifts, and wages - didn't expect such a quick response!

Neither myself or the other person who I have shared my pass with has been ticketed, ever. When I say share I mean that both your car and my car [identified via license plates] will be under a single account. During my time sharing a pass I have had days where we have had both cars on campus at the same time, actually this happened quite often, and sometimes even parked right next to one another. As I stated earlier, no tickets ever. Unfortunately, this past year all my friends had graduated and I have yet to find someone who is willing to go half way on a parking pass with me. I believe the current going rate for a parking pass is $327. If you are interested please shoot me a message and we can talk about it further. Good luck this year everyone. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm not whining or griping I'm just curious as to why our break is only 3 weeks when many other schools have 5 and 6 week breaks while still having the same start and finish dates as our school.  <eos> \n","<bos> My friends and I will be living in Res on 10th this coming year and we were wondering if any Redditors have lived there before.

Did 5 years and got a degree in aero engineering.  Now for a while I have been doing mechanical and currently a whole different type of engineering For a check the box, resume weed out thing for engineering a degree is essential. But as for being beneficial to what it is I actually did I would say it was a waste of time and money for most part. I’d argue 1 to 2 years at MOST out of 5 was beneficial. Most of the classes were either fluff and/or I could just have got the same knowledge renting a book from the library and reading. Having a prof and a class added no value. And most of the classes you do the work for the grade and immediately forget Physics courses were basically a repeat of HS. Chem course ditto Intro to engineering was only valuable in parts to learn auto desk inventor and Matlab. The 3view drawing stuff was more basic than my mechanical drafting class in HS My major thermo and heat transfer and to an extent gas dynamics were good (prefer a better prof for gas). But the rest I couldn’t hear and or they were so all over the place I couldn’t understand  The GECs were useless. English classes didn’t really require effort  ECE was a repeat of second physics Mech E classes were repeats of physics Math was good.  College was a good experience from a social fun type experience. But from a useful knowledge type stuff it was largely a waste of time and money. In my experience engineering is best learn on the job as like an apprentice with a mentor. What I do now I had no education in yet am able to do it thanks to that.  And find ways not to buy textbooks! <eos> \n","<bos> Stephen Stuckwisch or Mary McCormick?  <eos> \n","<bos> Currently a 2nd year Food Engineering major looking for some other guys to room with for next year. <eos> \n","<bos> I know they cost $10 each but I'm broke and need the money.

If you are a freshman, it will probably be unlikely that you will be housed in north campus, most likely south or west campus. So for that reason, I decided to keep this list for south and west campus only.  1. Park-Stradley or Smith-Steeb (just hella nice overall) 2. Siebert (A/C, renovated, good location) 3. Morrison (A/C, not renovated, good location) 4. Paterson-Bradley (No A/C, renovated, good location) 5. Mack and Canfield (No A/C, not renovated, good location) 6. Baker East and West (No A/C, not renovated, bad location) 7. Lincoln Tower (A/C, horrible location) 8. Morrill Tower (A/C horrible location) Overall if you are a freshman, I would aim for Smith Steeb Park Strad if you wanted to be closer to the union, high st, bars, chipotle, canes and blaze pizza, but Siebert and Morrison if you want to be closer to the gym, and on campus dining options.  <eos> \n","<bos> How much of a chance do you have for getting into a wait-listed class?

I have moved to Pittsburgh to start a new job, but left my roommate in our apartment near OSU campus. I was paying on my share of the rent until he was able to find a new roommate. However, he shared with me this past weekend that he was no longer able to pay his share and was leaving the apartment due to medical reasons. So, we moved out, but this has broken our lease early and, since he does not have the means to pay, leaves me with paying all fees until it is rented to new tenants or be sent to collections. Therefor, this is a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in the Stadium View complex, just west of OSU campus. It is on the top floor of a three floor building. It is off of campus, but an easy walk to get to school. Neighbors are mostly grad students, or small families, and very quiet. Maintenance is friendly and issues are fixed normally within 1 day of making them aware. It is pet friendly, with an extra deposit, the kitchen has a dish washer, and the living room is large. Both rooms have nice sized closets. The rent for us was $775 a month, but I think they are currently running deals for that to be a little cheaper. Trash and water are included in rent, and both Time Warner and WOW are available for cable. Again, this apartment is available as soon as it is turned over by the landlord, most likely this week, and needs new renters as soon as possible. Please PM me if you are interested so that we can organize with the leasing agent to get you into the correct apartment. Edit: The address is 858 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, Oh 43212. There is coin op laundry in the building and off street parking. <eos> \n","<bos> I dug through the course offerings in CSE that have specific prerequisites, the idea being to be able to set up the next semester in the best possible way.

However, I'm interested in computers, and I was considering computer information science for the longest time. However, I've learned from another student that Computer Science Engineering focuses on software and math, while Computer Information Science focuses on software and more GE courses (including some math focus). I was always under the impression that CSE focuses on both hardware and software, while CIS was strictly software; however, that viewpoint has changed based on what that student particularly said. My questions are these: What exactly is the difference between these two majors? What would be the career differences / salaries between these two? CIS seems to not be accredited by ABET; would that affect employment? Thanks. -Matt <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone rented from Cheplowitz  Associates? Or lived on Summit near Oakland?

I have a study abroad trip coming up from late July until mid August, and I understand students who are on disciplinary probation cannot participate in most study abroad programs. This specific program is individually organized through a 3rd party that I was allowed to use STEP money for. It's kind of a unique program that isn't credit bearing but rather service-oriented. Absolutely everything is paid for, from program fees to the flights themselves. Regardless though, I'm really stressed out about being barred from going since I used STEP money to pay for it. OSU-sponsored (\"1st party\") are programs that I would not be allowed on; this one is a 3rd party but one paid for with that STEP money that is \"sort of\" organized through the office of international affairs, even though I've applied separately and performed all monetary transactions through the 3rd party, having almost no contact with OSU. No one can answer whether I'll be barred from going other than the Office of Student Affairs considering how out of the ordinary this study abroad program is. What I wanted to ask is if anyone thinks I should even ask them. I read on the study abroad website that eligibility is checked during the application process as well as the term leading up to the study abroad. I'm in a sort of middle ground of those two, so I might get away with them not double checking my eligibility. So I really do think that the best course of action could be to just \"let it be,\" because otherwise I run the risk of having them know just because I was too investigative and paranoid. Does anyone have any experience with this? I really need some peace of mind right now.  <eos> \n","<bos> I know they're generally known as a terrible company, but they have a house in a really good location and price for what I need.

But does this mean that if I take one African American and African Studies (AAAS) course, I can fulfill a course in Literature, Visual/Performing Arts, Cultural, and Historical Studies? Or can AAAS only count toward say just literature and Cultural ideas? And I'd have to do another (diversity) course that would fulfill 2 different categories at once? (I'm going to be a double major pursuing a B.S., if its relevant, as apparently being a double major means OSU is even more flexible. Both majors are in the school of Arts and Science.)

I thought I did really good on the midterm but I ended up getting a 176/200 because the multiple choice was worth so much for only missing a couple and the only stuff I missed on the written portion was not giving a title and sample size, losing me 4 points from that.

My questions are the following..     1. Being a systems guy, which is the better the option? Computer Graphics or A.I. (core choice)  2. Is taking all cse courses a good idea?  3. Any good recommendations for fun systems courses and good professors for said courses?  4. Is the compiler design course very intense to where you should plan other cse courses around it that are easier due to the intensity of the projects assigned in compiler design course?  5. Is it good to still take easy gpa boosting courses even though they don't count anymore?  6. Good resources for getting better with graph theory to improve at algorithms and later on advanced algorithms (besides the Cormen book).  7. Which Capstone course fits more towards systems focus since there really isn't a systems capstone?  8. Are the cse clubs project oriented so they will help your resume?  9. Since I haven't had time in the past, is it recommend to join at least 1 cse club while finishing up your cse major?  10. Good recommendations on upper level systems professors?  11. Best professors to take for Automata, principles of programming languages, computer graphics (core choice), and intro to A.I. (core choice), Capstone courses?  12. How hard is to get professor approval to get into a certain course if you didn't take the prerequisite course?  13. What is the most enjoyable things to do on campus during your senior year to make your osu cse experience worth while?  14. Do things ease up to where you may have more free time after completing all of the engineering core to where only cse courses are left?

Is there a good way of going about this? <eos> \n","<bos> I feel like have been studying forever, does anyone have any tips on what I should focus more on? <eos> \n","<bos> Passed the class with a C.

Am I still able to get involved in the organization even if I don't have the knowledge that comes with the curriculum? I wanted to know because it sounds like an exciting project and I wanted to participate even if my role is small. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n","<bos> Hey Reddit. So I'm having a bit of a crisis. I just started my job near OSU, and I am about to move to my apartment in roughly a week. However, until that time, I'm stuck on the outside. I don't have a paycheck until the 4th, so I can't really sublease off of anybody. I was wondering if anybody near the northwest area of campus would be willing to help me for like.....three nights. I just need a place to sleep. That is it. If you are wondering about my personal integrity, we can talk in person. I'm a great conversation, and I would be at the very least happy to have a conversation. Thank you. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm graduating next semester and am in need of one more CSE technical elective. Can anyone explain the difference between CSE 3521 (Intro to AI) and CSE 5243 (Intro to Data Mining), as well as which one might be a more preferable pick in terms of how interesting/difficult the class is?  <eos> \n","<bos> So these guys above my sister and I blare their guitars and terrible music very frequently as loud as they possibly can ~5pm-Midnight/1am sometimes. My sister and I never complain. I'm a nightowl but always respect my noise levels, so around 4am I'll be on Skype talking with friends (not being too loud) and watching streams and one of the guys comes down and slams on our door then walks over to my window and beats on the window. I've contacted the managers of the complex but they literally ignored it. Really not too sure what to do here.  On E. 14th close to campus. <eos> \n","<bos> ... all them lovely OSU girl-ents at?

Can they keep the section open still? Traditionally, very few people take this language. In the third course of the sequence last autumn, 4 people took it and the class remained open, so could 2 people be enough? I am not sure if I should email the instructor yet.  <eos> \n","<bos> What is the class like?  <eos> \n","<bos> Anyone knows the cutoff for this year would be? so far i't looks like my EPHR would be 3.3857, you think that would be enough for admission? <eos> \n","<bos> Hi everyone, I am an incoming freshman at tOSU and was wondering if the amount of financial aid one receives changes if family income does not change.

I graduated 2017 so I am apparently required to live on campus now. Basically asking where you think sophomore transfers will end up. <eos> \n","<bos> Ok guys, in the thread of appreciating house keepers and our cota drivers, I say thank your dining hall chefs and utility workers.  They are working a lot of overtime right now and they FEED US. They deal with burns and cuts and standing long hours.  Just say a quick thank you. :)  <eos> \n","<bos> I recently got back my AP scores from this year and I got a 5 on Calc AB and a 4 on Physics C: Mechanics. Being a mechanical engineering major, should I use this credit? I also want to get a minor in computer science, so would opening up these credit hours be useful? thanks <eos> \n","<bos> I took 4 years of spanish in high school and tested into Spanish 103.66 before my freshman year. I haven't taken one spanish class since then (big mistake on my part) and I'm in my senior (well, 4th year) year now. How difficult is 103.66 and what do they cover?  Or really, I'm just looking for any advice about the class/spanish at OSU. Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> Someone gimme the rundown. I’m a nontrad so I never really got any info about it when I came here. I don’t necessarily need an unlimited plan because I’m only on campus 4-5 days a week. Thank you!  <eos> \n","<bos> So I'm #6 on the waitlist for CSE 2111.

I just saw it so I completed it all within 1.5 hours of emailing him (due date was last wed I think) but it counts for 30% of the grade. Does anyone think that he will be understanding if I did really well on all of the quizzes/exam that was there?.... <eos> \n","<bos> Where is the PINK truck going to be today?

As long as I can get decent hours (20+). Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> Just sat in a garage for upwards of 30 minutes (with cars behind me) after being hung up on two times by a campus parc employee. They said they didn't have the authority to open the gate on this side of the garage until a police officer came and asked them to. Such bullshit. I hate this company.  <eos> \n","<bos> !!!???? wtf did i do to get every single zodiac account to follow me?? like i’m private i don’t understand  <eos> \n","<bos> The form was due on Monday, I submitted it Tuesday night.

However, its getting really difficult, and I don't know how I'll do on the upcoming midterm/final. Friday is the last day to drop, and I don't know if it's worth the W. How bad do W's look? Also, is CSE/ENGR 1221 (Intro to MATLAB) easy? I haven't heard anything about it... Not sure what the quarter equivalent was. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm interested in taking the GMAT.

I'm a current first year that went random and has totally regretted it- got stuck with a roommate completely opposite of me and who's just not that great of a person. Because of this, I don't wanna go random next year... but I haven't made many friends either of the same gender or who are also looking to switch roommates. Where would be the best place to look for a roommate? Most of the posts I see online (here, Facebook, etc.) are for off campus roommates. Or should I just go random again and hope for better luck? Any advice is helpful! Thanks! :) <eos> \n","<bos> Hi everyone! I hope finals week studying is going well! :-) I was just wondering, for anyone who has taken Wysocki's ochem 2 class, what the final was like. I am just wishing there was a practice final to work with.. I know it will be cumulative, but just how hard it was compared to the past midterms! (and maybe if he curves..? haha) Thanks ahead! <eos> \n","<bos> Are both wifis down right now, they dont appear on my phone, xbox or computer <eos> \n","<bos> If any of you want to work together on this course I am creating a discord server.

I'm in art 400 (black and white film photography) and our assignment is to take pictures of people we don't know in their natural settings and try to capture something about them as people.

I've been put in charge of recruiting a coding ninja-in-training for Fall Quarter and beyond for our extremely fun and established [web design firm]([url link] I'd prefer to help out another Redditor if I can, but feel free to forward this on to your non-redditor friends if you think they would fit. We're looking specifically for a skilled and eager undergraduate who is competent in PHP and Javascript and would appreciate our irreverent corporate culture. Joomla and WordPress knowledge would be a plus. Desire to play old-school Nintendo games with us optional but appreciated.  You'd work about 20 hours a week (we can guarantee you 20, but if you have an exam that week we could tone the workload down for you). While we would need you to come out to Dublin occasionally (and for the right person, I'd be willing to carpool), the majority of the work could be done at home in your PJs if you like - we're flexible as long as work gets done on time.  Compensation is $10 hourly, with an option for full \"real\" employment post-graduation if things go well. If you're interested, send a resume over to apply@forefrontweb.com with a couple lines on why you think you'd be a good fit. We'll be interviewing people late this week/next week and starting the one or two we pick immediately. I'll be off and on this account, but feel free to PM me if you have questions. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm interested in becoming part of The Best Damn Band in the Land when I (hopefully) go to Ohio State, but I'm curious for the recruitment process. Is it a long and rigorous process or is it just a matter of putting on a good audition? Also, do you have to try out every year or is it one of those once you're in, you're in type of things? <eos> \n","<bos> North Campus? South Campus?

I think it's been up there at least 2 years. It survived thunderstorms, winter blizzards, wind, cold, heat, you name it. Eventually, what brought it down was age and deterioration. RIP in peace little buddy. :(  <eos> \n","<bos> I had an 86.32% before the curve. However, my final grade is a B. I thought it would at least go up to a B+. I always heard this class gets a nice curve, but this seems to be otherwise. By the way, I'm in Dr. Fus' section. What's up? <eos> \n","<bos> Then remember that there is now a bike lane. I was almost hit 4 times today while biking to and from work. All by people coming from campus area taking a right or crossing summit. You have to watch out for bikers and realize that when they have a green symbol you have to look both ways before you turn.  My safety is not superseded by you shaving 5 seconds off your commute.  <eos> \n","<bos> I took MATH 1172 at CSCC last semester and I'm trying to figure out what I need to do to make sure I can keep my enrollment status in MATH 2173 at OSU for this upcoming semester.

But I am an incoming freshman and I have a couple questions. I went to syllabus.osu.edu and I found my syllabus but it seems to be from 2015. Where do professors post the syllabus for classes usually? or do I have to wait until the first week of classes? Also, I would like to get a head start on buying textbooks. I'm only concerned about bio 1113 and chem 1210. So if I go to the Barnes and nobles link from my sched ,the textbook names are super vague and the isbns aren't accurate. lol im confud=sed, sorry for the long question. Can someone help me out?? <eos> \n","<bos> As stated... Before continuing I'd like to state that I would never condone this idea. I'm just genuinely curious and highly, highly doubt I'd ever get a straight answer from the bursar. OSU uses a system that charges a convenience fee if you pay by card. A friend charged over 40% of her card (she's on a 0% APR thing) to fund her last semester tuition (Spring 2016). A few weeks after graduating she did a chargeback. After a month of back and forth, the card company (who I shall not name), refunded the total amount back onto her account. How she did this I'd rather not say (it is a morally gray area I suppose), but she was successful. This woman now has a $70k job straight out of school and her degree. So is that it? The card company said their decision was final. Even still, could OSU do anything against her? <eos> \n","<bos> I have a couch that I need to store somewhere the first two weeks of August.

Our room is in the corner, so I think it might be a bit smaller. One bed is lofted and one is not, with the lofted bed going straight into the wall from entering the room, with said desk and supplies underneath. The unlofted bed is perpendicular to the other bed in the back corner, with the feet side of the bed near the head side of the lofted bed. The supplies for this person are next to the bed, going all the way to the closet. Is there any way we can make the bed shorter because i dont think the unlofted bed longways will work because then the new desk cant fit. Also the micro/fridge system is in front of the lofted bed right in front of the door.

What happened was tragic and I would never joke about something like that. My question is what is the highest accessible point of campus? I just need to sit and think about stuff awhile. If you could tell me if there is any secluded but safe place that I could just be alone for awhile that would suffice.  UPDATE: I feel obligated to tell anyone that may come across this after what happened today (April 8th, 2018) that I am ok. What happened today and Thursday is extremely tragic and and saddening. Last night I made this post because I wanted to go someplace to be alone and to think about things because I have been very stressed lately. I wanted to have some good scenery, whether I was indoors or outdoors. I was able to clear my head last night and I am doing OK, so do not be concerned about me. College can be overwhelming and it can feel like too much for people. To some, a grade might unfortunately feel like the end of the world. Even at a big campus like this I often feel alone, and I am sure many people feel the same way. I would like to encourage people to reach out to people that may look like they're having a rough time. Invite them to go to an event with you and your friends. They may so no, but receiving an invitation might brighten their day.

I'm specifically looking at Runaway Bay, The Quarry, Watermark... Basically there are a bunch of apartments at the end of 5th avenue around a lake. And I want to know which is best.

I'm now at the business school and doing much better. Now if for my resume or if I apply to a job that asks for my GPA, it's only a 3.0 due to those bad engineering grades. If they only included business school classes, it would be like a 3.7 or so. Is there anywhere that will show such a GPA that only includes the classes in my major? I think just calculating it myself seems unofficial. I've looked through my degree audit and advising report and haven't found anything.

I just wanted to bring this up now to see what everyone thought and also because Wolfbad's was pretty detailed so we would really have to find someone willing to do it or form a team. Thoughts?

We take one class in the first session and then switch to the next in the second session. Both are 4 credit hours. Would they equal 4 credit hours together or would they add up to 8 credit hours for the entire semester? <eos> \n","<bos> I know there's a few threads already about commuter parking but none of those really helped me. I'm a new student, and I'm commuting from around Polaris. My classes start at 930 on tues/thurs and 11ish on mon/wed, and they're all around central campus except for my 930 class which is at Hamilton. CampusParc is giving me a lot of west campus parking pass options but that seems really far, especially for my Hamilton class. I really want to buy a pass because looking for parking is stressful for me and I want an option that will guarantee me an easy spot each morning. What's my best option? Thanks! Also, I heard COTA is a great way to get around. All I need is my BuckID? Do I need to activate it or something or am I good to go? <eos> \n","<bos> Are you a student with programming skills?

My advisor suggested I choose this one, but considering my lack of math ability and little to no experience in Excel and Access, I'm not sure if I should (also, I guess the instructor is awful). The other options are Phil 1500 intro to logic and Linguistics 2001. I've never taken anything related to logic and can probably assume I'm just as bad at that as math, considering. Can anyone give me some info on 1111? Thanks in advance. <eos> \n","<bos> Quick question here, I graduated last year, but still have my BuckID. I know when I used to go to hockey games they would just glance at your BuckID and let you in free. Are baseball games the same way? As in, if I go up there do they scan them / have a way of knowing I'm not currently a student. I know, I know, support the team blah blah blah, but I already owe OSU too much money at the moment.

Friends are encouraging me to take some at Columbus State or at a regional campus and thats what I was planning to do for Anatomy and EEOB but after hearing some stuff about Chemistry, I'm not sure if its the best thing for me to take Chemistry here. Is Chemistry that hard? Has anyone taken these classes that can give me some advice on which to take at a regional/cstate?

My landlord is putting serious pressure on me to let him know ASAP. I'm a 21 year old senior nursing major, and will be starting grad school in the summer. I've got a nice 2 bedroom apartment on 14th and Summit for $450 a month, but my roommate is leaving. The lease ends mid-August.

I had taken a stats class two years ago at Ohio Northern which counted as that prereq, but it's been a while since I've taken Stats. I know this is a pretty rigorous course that builds off the first class(which i rememeber nothing from lol). Does anyone have any advice for how I can prepare? I was considering getting the textbook from the first course to review but I can't find a current generic syllabus for it anywhere so I'm not even sure what textbook/chapters to review.

If you really really don't want something, buy something for the cashier, the person behind you, your mom, your neighbor's hamster, anyone. You already payed for your blocks anyways. I'm a cashier at a cstore and today someone used a block for 15 cents and it just drives me crazy. Not only is it wasteful for you, but we as cashiers can get in trouble for this by management because every cent that is not used on a block doesn't go to the dining facility (it goes to the university.) As cashiers we try to tell people that so and so is $x and you can fill up your block, but some people don't budge. I know it's not my business what people do with their money/blocks but it just seems foolish to me. A few years ago while I was cashiering someone bought me a Reese's cup and it made my day (campus dining sucks the life out of you.) It is not going to affect you negatively in any way and it can make a fellow Buckeye (or hamster) happy. Come on guys!! <eos> \n","<bos> I lost my wallet sometime from 1:30pm to 3:00pm somewhere around McPherson I believe. It's a brown wallet with this sorta penguin branding on the corner of it.

Basically, that traffic safety committee requested officers carry out another ticketing blitz. But this time, officers have been asked to actually write tickets, not just give warnings. They plan to target jaywalkers that step in front of traffic and bicyclist who ride on sidewalks **(specifically around the Oval)**.

In 2221 I got 10 on all project and homework and so far in 2231 I have a 10 on all project and homework and have no problem with the coursework.

There's no official listing yet; the landlord is considering referrals from current tenants only right now. A bit about the place: it's a 3 bedroom house with 1 bathroom (the one real downside), central air and heat, large basement, and kitchen with gas stove, sink/garbage disposal, and refrigerator, but unfortunately no dishwasher. There's a couple fairly large common areas: one between the bedrooms on the second floor (ideal for a desk or two since one bedroom wouldn't be able to fit a desk) and another on the first floor between the kitchen and the front door. Rent would be $1600/month between 3 people, no utilities included. 12 month lease starting August 1st. Please respond if interested. I really don't want to miss this opportunity! The place is awesome, and the landlord is a great guy from what I can tell! <eos> \n","<bos> Did anything every happen to that professor that sent the email about the student to the whole mailing list?  <eos> \n","<bos> Reddi-wip is also acceptable, please and thank you <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone taken the physics 1201 final? How does it compare to the midterms/ quizzes in difficulty? Is the class curved to a 77 after the curve to everything else has been applied? I'm so ridiculously bad at physics it's laughable.

I tried to go the bookstore and check it out, but they were out of stock and couldn't tell me what was in the kit. Exactly as helpful as the bookstore usually is. I know there's an arduino, breadboard, resistors, etc in the kit but what else?

I tried switching classes and looking for different available sections, but they are all either full and/or don't work with my schedule. I don't want to remake my entire schedule. So, is she honestly impossible? I've never taken Statistics before so I'm pretty worried, especially since this is the semester I need to raise my GPA to get into the CSE program. All tips/feedback are appreciated, I'm planning on putting a ton of time into this class, and would be fine just getting a B in this class. Also, a side question for anyone that has had him. What can I expect from Adam Rappold for Classics 2220, as a gen ed. He got pretty bad reviews too, but I feel like a lot of the people on ratemyprofessor sounded lazy like they were surprised they had to read and write essays. I love mythology, but I'm hoping that this gen ed won't be too time consuming. Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> I switched to ATT because TWC screwed me last year (like a $25 monthly increase after they got bought out, assholes), and my apartment isn't covered by Wow, so ATT it was. I've noticed in the last two or three weeks that the wifi is incredibly slow at certain times in the day. I'm curious if it's my computer, or if others in the area have noticed it acting up lately as well. <eos> \n","<bos> I’m a sophomore looking for some people to study with!!

It is going to, however, require that I take spring quarter off. I emailed my academic advisor asking about that, but he hasn't responded, and I would like some basic answers sooner rather than later. How do I go about doing this with the university as far as not being there spring quarter, but still being a student. Is it as simple as not registering for spring quarter classes like you do if you go home for the summer? How do I let university housing know I'm moving out a quarter early? I live in the dorms, and of course I'll be moving out at the end of winter quarter. <eos> \n","<bos> I had gotten my hopes up after reading [this thread]([url link] right here, but nothing seemed to come of all the discussions of house parties and pizza etc. THEN I was all excited to go to lunch w/ our very own Reddit-famous I_am_the_cheese after reading [this]([url link] but I ended up staying stuck in the lab until 8 pm.

I had it locked up to a no parking sign (all the bike racks were filled when I'd come to class), so I'm thinking CampusParc may have taken it for not locking it to a rack. (It was locked so I'm fairly certain it wasn't stolen. Does anyone know if there's somewhere I can call to see/confirm they have it, and if so if there's a way I can get it back? For a fee I'm sure but that's besides the point. I'd at least like to ask before assuming it was stolen. On a related note, anyone know where you can buy a cheap bike?

I did about 2/3 of the hours, but got too busy to complete the rest. I have been working two jobs (one is at night) this semester, plus a full course load (science major), and I struggle really badly with generalized anxiety and chronic depression. I tried to find treatment through OSU but have been put on a waitlist for a semester and a half so far - despite the fact that counseling services will give out free walk-in sessions to all students after every campus incident. This site is so fast-paced and stressful that it is a literal hellhole for anyone with anxiety disorders. Plus I have no car so I am forced to take a series of public buses (1 hour travel time each way), which is also terrible. I dread going and am always so tired, which is why I made excuses not to go and ended up without enough hours. What sucks is that I would have had a 96 in this class without this incident. Does anyone have any advice on what to expect in my meeting, as far as grades and punishment? Also, I have two academic scholarships - do you think they'll be taken away?  Also, the professor who turned me in offered to speak on my behalf about my mental illnesses because I have spoken to him about how they affect my volunteer experience in my papers.  This is my first academic misconduct charge and I am a sophomore undergrad, if that helps. ***Edit: I am not here for judgement on my poor decisions and my anxiety. I just want your opinion on what you think my possible punishment could be.  <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone heard back from mech eng about whether or not they were accepted?

[url link]  A couple of friends and I we built this site and are currently running it. (sometimes it just sucks to manage a startup esp. you're doing it with your close friends... sigh) Anyway, for those who want to be self-taught programmers or if you're a CSE Major, it would be super helpful if you could shed some light. This site is similar to Code School, Codecademy and many other MOOC for coders, but at a much smaller size considering we're only starting. One thing unique about it is that it provides FREE virtual machine service - a Linux Ubuntu environment Personally I'm using it to learn Python, but I want to hear your thoughts in terms of anything (i.e: what you like, what you don't like, anything to improve or simply say hi lol etc.) [url link] We also create Facebook and Twitter accounts: @WeAreLabEx [url link] [url link] Again, million thanks!  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys!

In my experience, the prices go down as the leasing year goes on because they get more desperate to sign people on. Often times they'll throw in bonuses like giftcards and other incentives. If you talk to someone in leasing and they tell you stuff like \"I can't guarantee you X because were we have Y other people looking at it.\" More than likely it just the leasing office rep being sleazy about trying to hurry you into a lease, It takes them forever to sign people on. I have also seen several people on facebook trying to release their leases this summer for like $700 at highline, which I think was $210 lower than their cheapest unit at the time. <eos> \n","<bos> I was wondering if any of you guys know if osu is doing some kind of discount for the summer semester?

Also how does it work with financial aid if you were planning to only take 3 credit hours during the summer?  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, I know we're only a couple days into the semester and all that, but I'm having trouble making friends. I live in Lincoln, which I feel hinders friend making in a couple ways. First of all, it is honors so in general people are less out-going and social, and second, the way the suites are structured makes it pretty much impossible to pop your head in and meet people or say hi. I know almost everyone on my floor, but it's tough to really hang out with people or get to know anyone. My roommates are fine, and we share some common interests, but they're very introverted and don't want to make friends or meet anyone, so I'm forced to do it alone. The rest of my suitemates are buddied up with their respective roommates, and also have little interest making new friends. I'm the only person in my suite that wants to get to know people and make friends, so I'm forced to do it alone. I pretty much know everyone on my floor, but none of them on any sort of personal level, pretty much just well enough that I know their names and they know mine, we talk when we see each other, but never actually hang out or anything.  I've tried hanging out in my suite's common area with the door open, and I've talked to a lot of people by doing that. However I feel doing that too much will seem weird as I'll be sitting there doing homework or reading on my phone when people walk by all the time.  Any advice? Am I an over-reacting freshman?  Thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> The OSU Men's team tip drops the puck against #2 Miami (OH) tomorrow at 7PM.

I managed to get 2 of 3 A's so far but the 4 credit hour systems 1 final collided with a take home final information security (madrid) so C+ will kill that future. I discovered that exams are my weakness and I don't know what else to do to improve (even with extra time). In my upcoming semester (wait listed and first 1st on list hope I get in still) I have supowit for foundations 2 and babic for systems 2 (also impossible to switch being on the waitlist). I also have networking (computer networking intro moreless) with Chunyi Peng and Charles Giles for Web Apps. Any tips for all of these courses and surviving these professors? Any tips on better prep for midterms and finals (for cse courses) will be helpful too considering it's my biggest weakness and not sure what else to do even with extra time  <eos> \n","<bos> Can anybody give me any advice for the final?

Went and checked out the stuff today and it's perfectly ok for us to use it. Reserved a room for Tuesday to go in for an hour to learn how to use stuff. Like I said I'll get back to people later this week! Hey everyone, Since the term is over and my roommate and I are still gonna be around this summer, we've been tossing this idea of a podcast around in our head as a summer project. Figured we could start it out just fine on our own but are not opposed to adding more people to the mix. Here are some of our podcast influences for this: H3H3 Podcast, Funhaus, Super Best Friendcast, Coffee With Clemps, Co-Optional Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast The subjects we're looking forward to discussing are video games, things going on on youtube, and basically all sorts of nerd stuff and other things that come with that. After my exam on Tuesday, I'll be looking into if we can use Denney Hall's audio/video studio as our base of operations since they are available for rental times.  Right now its lookin at probably a commitment of one day for anywhere between 1 to 2 1/2 hours every 1 or 2 weeks. Once we get rolling we'd have a better idea so these are just our estimates. If you're interested we'd be glad to meet up and talk about it more and work out some details. Suggestions are also welcome! If you're interested then shoot me a message on Reddit. Good luck on your last exams! <eos> \n","<bos> Has anyone taken this class with Joseph Lipp?

We are currently living in a house and have 2-3 open spots: 1 full room and 1 very spacious basement that can fit 2 people and has it's own bathroom. Laundry facilities are located in the building and do cost about $1 for a wash and dry together, cheaper than off-campus laundromats. It's technically 2 houses so there are two kitchens and four bathrooms, one on every floor. There is also a porch. Very spacious living room. It's located on E. Northwood not far from High St, so campus is walkable distance. Rent comes down to $522/mo not including utilities ($50-$70/month but it's generally only on the more expensive side in the winter). Housing is cheaper if you want to share the basement with a friend at $460/mo. It's very nice and large. No pets, and smoking is allowed outside. Current residents are friendly and mostly gamers who usually enjoy drinking and having a good time on the weekends. A few are going to be students next year, others will be working on and around campus. There are four parking spots included, and next year only 2 will have cars. If you have any questions or are interested, please let me know! <eos> \n","<bos> One of my classes for Autumn is apparently located at \"Gateway Film Center House 2\".

I currently live with a female so out of respect for her I will only consider females to take over. I am trying to get my own unit closer to campus and so I can have my dog with me. We currently split rent and utilities 50/50, which takes it to around 450.00-500.00/month each. I will also donate my parking pass so you do not have to pay $100 for one (they actually tow the lot).

I would like to get it in early but I don’t know why the box for it is counting the spaces between words also. Has this happened to anyone else? And how am I supposed to fix it. My essay is perfect and I’m not willing to change it. Admissions said that it should be between 250-500 words and it is but I’m worried I won’t be able to have it submitted as early as I wanted.

I will be starting at OSU in the Summer to complete a Bio Degree (accepted, orientation in April). At this time, I am Biology/pre-med. After finishing a Bio degree, I want to branch out and increase my GPA before applying to a Graduate program/Med school (or maybe I will pursue engineering instead).  Does the CSE program at OSU accept transfers? Is it possible to double major in both Bio and CSE? What are the requirements (GPA, Gen Eds., etc.)? How difficult is it to get into the program? Current students- would you recommend the program?  Background info: I have a decent amount transfer credits (110+) and have completed many prerequisites/gen. eds with the exception of Calc and Physics.  3.5 GPA and 3.3 sGPA (too low for MD programs atm). tl;dr - Want to do CSE -- Advice?  <eos> \n","<bos> Hi to all, I plan on finishing my BA at OSU in 3 years (AP credit) and enrolling in a 1 year masters program to get my teaching license.  During this one year program, I would like to become a TA. I'm wondering how easy it is to get a TA position, and what the process is to become one. Hopefully, if I express interest early on, I'll be able to get the opportunity. I'll be majoring in something in the College of Arts and Sciences (potential majors are econ, psych, history, and polisci) Also, what are the benefits that TAs receive at Ohio State? I've heard that some tuition is taken care of, which would be wonderful, since I am an out of state student.  Thank you!  <eos> \n","<bos> Since the PDF/app that the Engineering Expo provides aren't particularly useful, I rigged a spreadsheet up that is sortable/filterable/etc. I recommend hiding columns that you don't care about (columns that aren't your major, etc).

After getting into some of the classes and meeting some of the people, I realized that I should back to my math and science ways. But because of the 5 year COOP program, I decided to switch to OSU so I could do it in 4 as opposed to 6 (1 year for random classes and 5 years for the engineering program). Transferred to OSU Newark LATE December 2013(awhile ago I know) and lived at home because I moved within 2 weeks of starting and couldn't get anything close to campus. For the fall, I got an apartment with the GF who decided to move back home with her family in VA. So I am currently in an apartment by myself until July, when I move out. So here's the question: I never really made any friends until this semester b/c of my 100+ people lecture classes, and I traveled like 20 mins by car to get to my apartment, so I kind of kept to myself and talked to the couple of friends I had already. I want to get involved on campus with activities like I did at UC, but feel like a Junior in a dorm would be kind of awkward. And while I have friends around, most of them already have living arrangements for the fall. So my other option would be to get a 1 bed apartment to live by myself. A final option would be to move back home so I could save some money and pay off student loans. The downside is that the drive is still 20 minutes away, so I would be very far away from campus. Any constructive input is useful! And if you need more info, just ask me! Thanks guys! PS - Computer Science major here <eos> \n","<bos> So this is my first year living off campus and because of limited driveway space I've been parking in the street.

Up until now I’ve just been jogging for ~45 minutes a day, which I’ve been doing less and less as of late. I’d like to start a daily workout routine, but I’m kind of lost with all the new equipment available to me.  I’ll probably try to do a daily jog, either in the morning (8 am classes whoop) or in the evening, and run on treadmills on bad weather days. I’m not super concerned with building muscle, though I hate having wet noodles for arms. So, do you workout, and if so, what is your routine? Also, do you workout alone, or do you always do it with a friend? <eos> \n","<bos> So...I was working on my honors contract a long time ago. Then I stopped for a long time because I was really considering adding another major. I've decided to do so, but to make it official I have to meet with my advisor and I can't do it until April 6th. The deadline is April 3rd. I guess from the site it has to be done by the end of the semester.  I also forgot I had to meet with my departmental honors advisors and prob can't get meetings for another week or so.

I have honors scheduling and I heard that doesn't change if you don't continue with honors which is good, but to be safe or just get extra priority, I'm hoping to get senior status by the end of the summer, I'm a sophomore.  So will I be able to get into specialization classes that aren't my declared specialization? I won't be declaring my second specialization until next spring and I hope I can get into it with my gpa.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys! Sorry to be a pain, but I'm a freshman planning out my schedule for next semester and I'm a bit confused. On my advising report, my survey professor wrote that one of the classes I should take is English 1110 or bio 1113/1114. I would like to take bio, but that would leave me needing to take English 1110 next autumn. I was wondering, can I even do this because the class is called \"first-year English composition?\" I'm not sure if it's limited to first years or not.

I am willing to pay. <eos> \n","<bos> Okay so I got accepted earlier this semester to transfer from another college and I kinda overdid it on classes this semester to the point where I might get C's in 2-3 of them and possibly a D in one of them if I mess up enough on finals (first semester I got a 3.24 and if I get what I think I might it could bring me down to a 2.6-2.8, and just if it matters in a Mechanical Engineering major, but I'm switching majors when I get to OSU.) So I am wondering if OSU can take back my admission after I've accepted admission, or if I'm just worrying too much. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

What style of dining hall do you guys suggest working in? I'm open to any style (marketplace, traditional,whatever) but what environment do you guys think is better?

I volunteered hundreds of hours, but I chose when I showed up and things were pretty flexible-it was nothing like a real job. Will I be able to find an on campus job despite my lack of workplace experience? 3) As a freshman, is it a good idea for me to get a job at the beginning of the year? Or should I wait until I have a set routine? Is it difficult to find a job on campus later in the year? 4) Any other general comments about on campus jobs at osu? Thanks for your input! I really appreciate you taking time to answer my questions!  <eos> \n","<bos> I’m a 2nd year at OSU and I’m not happy with my social life at this point. I have mostly acquaintances, and some friends who I can hang out 1-on-1 with, but I really just want a solid *group* of friends, you know, one where we all hang out together a lot of the time, not just hanging out with separate people 1-on-1 who don’t know each other. I figure getting into a frat is the best way to do this, but I have some reservations.  I’m not a huge partier or drinker. I like to once in a while, and I’m always down for a beer, but partying regularly, getting shitfaced, drugs, etc. is not my thing. I also don’t have a fake so I can’t go out to bars/clubs that require ID to get in anyways.  Also not interested in getting hazed. I know no one really wants to get hazed, but I think the claim that it’s good for bonding is BS. You can bond in better ways than getting hazed. I would never haze someone else, so I don’t really want to be friends with people who’d want to do it to me.  I’m just super against the whole typical always partying, getting shitfaced, hooking up, hazing frat. I know the stereotype is usually overplayed, but I’ve also seen it be completely accurate at times here at OSU.  I just want a good group of friends that I can hang out with and go do stuff with regularly, maybe drink occasionally, go lift with, go to football games together, study together, go play some sports for fun (noncompetitively), etc.  So... sorry for the novel, but what frats would fit me best here at OSU?  **tl;dr:** need a frat that doesn’t fit the fratboy stereotype but also isn’t lame  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey OSU, I wanted to post this so I could gain some personal advice and also serve as a reference for people also experiencing the housing anxiety. I am an incoming freshman into the Fisher school of business and am looking for my perfect dorm. I plan on doing intramural sports, having a fun time on campus, but still do well on my studies. I love to socialize and make friends with whoever I can talk to, and plan to leave my door open all the time. I was wondering if I could get some advice on where to submit my preferences from a former student or someone who knows the campus well. In a nutshell, I want a hall that isn't too long of a walk to classes, with a classic college dorm feel, where I can make friends and be in a nice comfortable dorm with one other person.

The course is Yiddish 2367 I think you can also find it as Jewish studies 2367 but I'm not sure about that. You do write in the class but most of it is in class. The one paper we had to write outside of class was a revised version of an in class essay. Most homework comes in the form of write a paragraph about some assigned topic or watch or read something. There is an 8 page final paper but that go cancelled for us. On top of that the instructor is really great and enthusiastic about the subject material. Not sure if there are multiple professors but if there are look for Geoffrey Algar. I highly recommend this course. <eos> \", \"<bos> You were the first bus driver to ever cart me around after I transferred to OSU. I was used to quaint little colleges where everyone walked and there were no buses. I remarked that your driving was comparable to being on safari, and people sitting around me laughed. The next week I awkwardly caught a kid who otherwise would have landed on his butt thanks to your unexpected quick stops. Once, I was stupidly trying to do homework while standing, and I fell into a random guy's lap when you quick-stopped at a light.  But you know what? I've learned to appreciate your driving style. You've waited for me numerous times as I sprinted across the commuter parking lot trying to catch the bus, and I swear you even smiled at me once after I breathlessly thanked you. When I'm waiting on the curb and I see you driving the next bus to Academic Core, I smile a little because I know I won't be late for my morning class. I know if there was ever any funny business going on in your bus, you'd put a stop to it faster than any of those other scrawny boy drivers. You're professional, quick, and you give off definite badass vibes.  So I salute you, Mr. Bald Bus Driver.

I came in with a good amount of credit, so I'd be done after 2.5 years. Grad school is in my future obviously, but I have been thinking about what I want to do and more undergrad education is an option. Adding another bachelor's, likely in Special Education, has my interest, but that requires a dual degree instead of just double-majoring. Does anyone have experience with dual degrees? They say no overlap with the GEs between colleges, but I know there are exceptions. Is it a huge pain in the ass? Could I pull it off in another 3 semesters?

Currently, my top choices are Business and Entrepreneurship  Innovation.  For context: I hope to someday work in new product development or something similar. I want my minor to help me with that. From what I've read, the Entrepreneurship  Innovation classes are more suited to my interests, but I also fear they may be too similar to my engineering classes to give me a solid knowledge of the business side of things. I'm also not sure which minor holds more weight: is a Business minor slightly more impressive than an Entrepreneurship  Innovation minor? Or vice versa? Or are they pretty equal? I know it's just a minor, but I want to make the right decision.

I\\'ve noticed that in Physics, Fundamentals of Engineering Class, and maybe somewhat of my Calculus 1 class, that it\\'s a lot more difficult for me to understand mathematical and scientific things than it is for others. It\\'s really difficult for me to understand equations at times and how to convert word problems into the appropriate equation. If these types of situations start coming into play with computer science/programming, then I\\'m worried that maybe I\\'m not right for this major.  My ACT score was quite a bit higher than the average ACT score for the rest of the freshman class, which I know isn\\'t an definite indicator for success or intelligence, but ideally, I should be doing just as well as other students and I\\'m not. I dedicate a significant amount of time to academics also, so I know that I\\'m not skimping out on that. I study, pay attention in class, do my homework, take notes, etc.  So all I\\'m left with is that I simply don\\'t think the right way that someone heading into this major should. I have never felt so academically challenged and so \"behind\" as I have the last 1-2 weeks.

I am on the borderline, so I need to maximize my chances of getting it. I submitted my ACT score of 29 (no writing). The only time I took writing was on my first new SAT which I scored 1220. Obviously this is significantly lower than the scholarship requirements. I took another new SAT without writing and scored a 1320, still not good enough for a scholarship. Based on members advice on here I only sent my ACT score. My question now (very last minute) is does OSU require a writing score? If so, that would require me to send my 1220 and then my 1320 as well to make me not look like a moron, correct? I really didn't plan on sending these scores, but I'm going to have to if they want the writing. <eos> \", '<bos> has anyone heard back about their application to CBE?  <eos> ', '<bos> What was the process like?

I\\'m a rising sophomore who\\'s enrolled in STEP next semester. Preferably, I\\'d like to use those funds to help pay for some kind of excursion out of the country, pretty typical.

However, I realize that I have taken neither linear algebra nor stats 3470, which are pre/corequisites for the class. Will I be able to sign up for foundations 2 anyways, and just take the other classes at the same time? Would taking linear, stats, and foundations 2 be too much all at the same time?

I actively am despising everything to do with pre med (namely: freshmen gen chem and calculus) and I don’t know what to do.

Participants will be asked to complete assessments to allow evaluation of the short- and longer-term effectiveness of this intervention. The study is designed to provide high quality clinical care, free of cost, to all study participants enrolled in the study and to improve treatment of depression for others in the future. **What are the symptoms of depression?** • Mood changes reflected by feeling low, gloomy, sad, blue, irritable, or crying more easily than usual • Loss of interest or enjoyment in things that used to be enjoyable, such as spending time with others, hobbies, sports, or work • Appetite and/or weight changes • Changes in sleep patterns • Feeling tired, slowed down, or lacking energy • Self-criticism, feeling guilty, or feelings of worthlessness • Difficulty making decisions, concentrating, or thinking clearly • Thoughts of death or harming yourself **Who is the Depression Treatment Study for?** We are recruiting adults ages 18+ for participation in the Depression Treatment Study. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression and are 18 years of age or older, you may qualify for the study. **What does it cost to participate in the Depression Treatment Study?** There is no charge for any of the evaluations or treatment associated with the study. **How long does the study last?** The study consists of 16 weeks of individual therapy. Additionally, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about once a month for one year after your treatment. **How do I get into the study?** Call **(614) 688-0968** to get more information about the study and complete an initial phone screening. If you do not qualify for the study (or would like treatment not provided in the study), study personnel can discuss other sources of treatment that might be appropriate for you. <eos> ', \"<bos> Sup, We're two cool dudes looking for another cool dude to come chill in our party mansion with us.

In just over a month\\'s time, we (along with our collaborator\\'s in **MUNDO** and the **Collegiate Council on World Affairs**) will be running the mega-game known as Watch the Skies. The event will take place Saturday, April 15th, from 2:00 PM to 10:00 PM in the Ohio Union. A mega-game is a game in which a large group of players (typically 30+) play at the same time and interact with each other over the course of the game. Watch the Skies puts the players in the shoes of world leaders or alien visitors during a time of alien contact with Earth. Players will need to be diplomatic and creative to tackle the challenges and crises laid before them over the course of the game; building allies with other nations, maneuvering their forces to handle threats, and allocating their resources wisely are all some things that each team as a nation will have to work together to accomplish.  This is a massive endeavor on the co-ordination end, and we are looking to reach out the the OSU community to bolster the number of players to help run the game as \"Control.\" Persons in the role of Control will help make sure everything runs smoothly and effectively on the day of the event. In return, your participation in the event and complimentary food-stuffs will come free of charge. Sign-ups for players are coming soon^(tm); but at the moment, we are just looking for those interested in helping **run the game.** You can find out more about our specific event and sign-up [here]([url link] If you\\'d like to see what Watch the Skies is all about, we highly recommend checking out Shut Up  Sit Down\\'s video on their play-through of the game [here]([url link] <eos> ', \"<bos> Hello fellow OSU classmates!

My first semester at OSU was spent half aware, because my high school was minuscule in comparison. A result of this was that I consistently parked in a staff spot. Had no clue. I never saw the signs and I was never told about them. I thought a west campus parking pass meant I could park at the west campus lot. Silly me. I eventually got a $60 citation. I emailed about it and got a few frustrating replies even though I explained the situation. I was new! I actually was accidentally double fined, so at least it was knocked down to $30. 2. Yesterday, the freaking day of my Summer class' exam, I was fined $60, because someone decided the permits should expire right before exam week, while everyone has much more to worry about. 3. My boss, who works in one of the departments at OSU, was cited for entering a garage while the arm was up. She has a pass, but the arm was up and she needed to park. She had a freaking pass and explained things to the guy who gave her the citation. The worst of it was that Campusparc put a hold on her **daughter's** account. Her daughter, who had nothing to do with the citation, was prevented from scheduling classes until the citation was settled. I'm not the best story-teller, but I felt this was worth sharing.

It had me listed as a non-Ohio resident. Naturally I contacted OSU to fix this. I was told it was a result of me selecting 'other' on the form that asks who you're dependent on. The problem is I am still dependent on my parents. I accidentally selected 'other' thinking everything was alright. I went through the process of amending the residency and I got to the point that asks for my parents address. Now I'm concerned because I don't live with my parents, I have a buddy I'm staying with. It's been this way for a few years now. Will I be considered an out of stater (or not dependent on my parents) due to living w/ a roommate elsewhere? It threw me off because Columbus State never seemed to care about this. I still paid the in-state cost for my years there. Maybe I'm overthinking this and things will be fine.

I'm an incoming freshman to honors engineering who tries to eat healthy, and I've been looking at the highly popular new dining plans to decide which one is best, but in the process of trying to find out which one is most economically sound, I seem to have found that the food options themselves aren't really all that healthy. Is this true, or are there ways for a dilligent eater to be healthy if they want to be? I expected there to be a large amount of junk food to choose from, but I naïvely assumed that there would be a sizeable amount of healthy food to chooose from as well since OSU is so big on athletics. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't REQUIRED that everyone living in a residence hall opt into one of the food plans, but alas that is not so.  I live in Columbus, so I could avoid living in a dorm (and thus the meal plans) if I wanted to, but I want to live in one to help initiate myself into the OSU community since I am a pretty quiet guy and to leave home. So what say? Is it realistic for a freshman at OSU to eat well through the dining plans (no Freshman Fifteen), and if so, how?

There was only one car that was heading south bound on High and the blue suv was slowing down because the light just turned red, so i started heading across the road. I was starting using the cross walk and decided to cut the corner and went behind the blue suv, where at no point was i more then 10 feet away from the crosswalk. As soon as i hit the side walk headed for the bus stop in between Arps and Stillman Hall, two bike police called for me so i went over to see if anything was happening that i wasnt aware of. So i told them that i had to go where i had to go and didnt see that i wasnt in danager at any point. So they made me take my backpack off and get out my id. I didnt have my drivers license because if i was going to get robbed i didnt want to lose anything super important, so i gave the two police officers my buckid which they yelled at me for not having my id. Then they told me to sit down being drunk with power which i thought was humiliating. After asking for my address which i gave multiple times, the one office yelled at me for not knowing my address which i also found humilating because multiple people keep watching as the walked by.

My fraternity started Mental Health Matters week two years ago, and this year we\\'ve partnered with nearly all other fraternities and sororities on campus to make as much of an impact on the mental health scene as possible. While Reddit is [obviously] not the biggest fan of Greek Life, often for good reason, I\\'m sure we all can agree that a dedicated group of 6,000 individuals has the potential to change things significantly for the better. The University hasn\\'t done anything, and is still reluctant to do anything, so we\\'ve decided to take it into our own hands. We\\'ve partnered with the Student Wellness Center, Lulu Lemon, multiple bars around campus, and a host of other organizations to make this as impactful as possible. Even U of M has expressed interest in implementing a program based on what we are doing. In most mentally unhealthy situations, the individual simply needs someone else to ask them the right questions. Our plan, approved by the University, is to provide training ( certification) to many more peer-to-peer counselors and to develop systems that will allow for *immediate*, certified, assistance while also allowing for long-term help afterward. I\\'d love for anybody that is willing to donate a few dollars, but as poor college students I realize that may be asking too much. If mental health is important to you, though, and you\\'d be able to simply share our purpose and the link to our GoFundMe, it would be immensely appreciated. The state of mental health on college campuses is abysmal, but we really want to change it for the better. Feel free to ask any questions about our plans and I\\'ll answer as best as I can.

I was in the Honors Collegium for 2 years before being kicked out for supposedly not doing enough. Ironically it seems almost every engineering student who started in the program was also kicked out because lo and behold, our curriculum didn’t allow room for triple majoring in basket weaving for peace or saving a small country in our spare time.  I got into two excellent grad school programs just fine without the help of the Collegium. DO NOT let them pressure you into doing more more more. They try to fast track you into grad school the minute you land in undergrad. This is not ok or normal. So if you’re thinking of applying, carefully consider whether it’s worth your time and energy. If you’ve had a great experience in the program, more power to you. And if you feel stuck in the program, take my advice and drop it - you will be much more successful when you don’t have to listen to others dictate what you will and won’t do with your scholarly time. <eos> ', '<bos> Just curious for now.

I'm taking all of my classes in the evenings and the start times are either 3:55 (Tuesday), 4:10 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), or 5:30 (Thursday). I heard that anyone can park on central campus who has any kind of permit after 4pm. I figured I would be parking there between 3:35 and 3:50 and was wondering if it would be safe to just buy the WC permit and park on central campus. My friend who just graduated said he parked in B spots on central campus at 3:30 regularly with no issues. He also said even if I do get a citation, the appeal process is easy and understanding. However, I would like some more opinions on both of these. As a secondary question, since I only need a permit for one semester instead of an entire school year, I heard you can return the permit to 160 Bevis Hall when you no longer need it. Does anyone have any experience with this and is it an easy process? I would be returning it in December, which would leave 7 months of the permit unused.

Well, here's the issue: I noticed after I made my purchase that they're student tickets. I'm not a student and the disclosure states that I will need to present an ID on the day of the game. Great.

I need to take one more course as a math and science elective, so I figured I should take the one most relevant to the major instead of taking the easiest one.

I took another job and am leaving the state soon. I ended my contract at the end of the Spring semester but still had obligations on campus so I had to go to CampusParc to get a new parking permit since I wasn\\'t a faculty member anymore. I purchase a parking permit at the CampusParc office and go on my way. A couple days later I get a parking ticket for having an \"Unregistered Vehicle\". So I call CampusParc and and they said my vehicle wasn\\'t registered, but I complain that I just bought a new permit a few days earlier. It turns out they linked my new permit to an old license plate even though I\\'d had a new license plate since November. So naturally I appeal the ticket.  Today I get an email from CampusParc saying they will drop the cost of the ticket to $7 for a \"failure to link\" violation and in the same letter they claimed that they didn\\'t have my new license plate on file.....you know, despite the fact I\\'d parked on campus with the new license plate for more than half a year....So I log in and sure enough, my new license plate isn\\'t in the system even though I distinctly remember adding it last fall. Unfortunately at this point, it\\'s not worth $7 to spend the time doing a secondary appeal....which sickens me since I know that\\'s exactly what CampusParc is bargaining on, that my time is worth more to me than a few bucks. I\\'ve heard too many similar stories from others about CampusParc. I\\'m planning to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and probably write a complaint letter to the Chamber of Commerce even though I know it won\\'t do much.

The math department literally says they only raise the grading scale if the class median is below a C-. Since OSU has been increasing their admission standards over the years, these medians have only been going up. From a friend I know for Math 1172 all of the midterms this year had a median above a C-. Also, there is no way to know if there\\'s actually going to be a curve until all the grades are posted, which is why asking about previous curves in the past is pointless. Even for the same course number, some instructors are easier or just better at teaching than others.  Expect no curves. Just study. If you can\\'t help those intrusive thoughts about a curve, redirect those thoughts when you get them.

On the heels of elimating all sexual assault resources they provide to students. I am editing this because when I initially posted I was led to believe by a individual I trust that there was empirical evidence of the police profiling women for underage drinking charges. After further speaking with her it is clear that evidence is not available.  I still want to dive in to how this is problematic victim blaming behavior though. Justifying this kind of policing with that evidence is insane. The correlation between alcohol and sexual assault occurs because many victims are intoxicated, not offenders. Whether or not your drunk doesn’t matter unless a rapist is nearby.  The problem isn’t that people are drunk and need to be arrested more. The problem is that it is still societally acceptable for people to rape others when they are incapable of defending themselves. Punishing others in order to take away “opportunities” for rapists is not a fair strategy. I particularly troubled that this strategy immediately followed SCE’s suspension of services.

He was an amazing, caring, and funny teacher. He cared so much about the students and their success. He has so much passion for teaching Chem 121 and other classes. At the end of the year he made a slideshow for our class to sum up the quarter, it was comprised of our SEI comments(which were hilarious) and his personal reasons why he started teaching and getting his degree. It was a sad and beautiful message toward the end(about his mom's death) and he had almost everybody in the class in tears. I was tearing up too.

Can some one give a quick synopsis of what to expect? What to bring/wear? What they’ll want to talk about? What majors they’re typically looking for?

I only knew of two tables (Student legal services, Ohio Department of Public Safety) that was accepting resumes, most told you to look online and pointed you to their site and gave you contact info. Go to as many tables as you can. You never know where you’ll get a good opportunity. I’m a POLITSC major, and my best hit came from the Leukemia  Lymphoma Society. They don’t outright ask you to talk about yourself. They’ll offer a handshake and expect you to get down to business. Lines aren’t very long if you go at the start of the fair. There’s printers in the resource room up the stairs and to the left in the union if you couldn’t/didn’t print out your resume. You should probably still have like 10 copies of it even though few tables were taking them. The majority were CSE based, but that will vary each time I’m sure. Don’t be afraid to go up and talk to tables you didn’t look up/research beforehand. Just tell them about yourself and your interests and ask what opportunities they have that might fit what you’re looking for.

Anyways, my boyfriend signed a lease for an apartment with Pella near N High St and W Oakland Ave. It looked nice when he signed it, he asked about crime and such and they said basically not to worry about anything. He doesn't go around that area much so he trusted what they told him. I didn't think much of it until I was browsing through some stuff on here about campus crime. It seems like where our apartment is might not be a great area. If anyone has any experiences with either just hearing about crime, or has lived there, knows someone who lives/lived there, etc. feedback would be appreciated.  <eos> \", '<bos> What are the chances OSU could increase the number of buses on each route?

My GPA is a 3.6 and I'm ranked 47th out of 177 students in my class (I attend a relatively competitive high school).  My ACT is currently a 27.

I took Spanish for three years and I have been in marching band and wind ensemble for four years. I also have done a bit of community service, Model UN, and some student political stuff.

So when I heard other engineering students say that CSCC was taking the easy way out I didn't believe it. But now I have to say they were right and I was wrong. I think it would have been more challenging to redo my high school algebra course than the course I took at CSCC. Can I generalize and say all courses at CSCC are like that? No, but I did get the impression that this was as difficult as it gets over there. So my advice is if you really want to learn the subject don't take the course at CSCC. The other option is to supplement your learning with online material which is what I did. <eos> \", '<bos> Does anyone know anything about this organization?

I am trying to keep up on everything in the courses such as the lecture problems, recitation problems and homework problems as well as quizzes when they arise, but I am finding it difficult to keep up and practice the lecture notes every time I cant remember how to do them, but I am getting the homeworks done as well as the quizzes.  My biggest issue is having little to no free time if I am doing this. I spend almost every waking moment either trying to get my homework done or keep up on the lecture notes and recitation problems. So does anyone have any advice on what I should not focus on and just pinpoint on either the homework and recitation problems or is it really necessary to go over the lecture notes as well. I know that going over everything will ensure me a good grade IF I can retain it all, but this seems like an impossible task as there is so much to go over on a weekly basis. But if just doing the homework and recitation problems as well as the quizzes over again, should I be able to make it through the semester with alright grades? At CSCC this has proven to be helpful for the ME courses I was taking there, but I know OSU is much much harder. I took ISE 2040 last semester and doing the homework problems as a review was almost pointless as I had got a D on the first midterm, but the course packet our teacher told us to bring to class daily ended up being a better resource to study from and I ended up with a B at the end of the course.

What \"related core\" courses/field did you pick? Was it easy getting the courses approved?

I am in a science major right now and entering my 2nd year, but I really don't know what I am doing/what I want to do with my life. I really thought I wanted to do pre\\\\-med, and I still think that is what I want to do, but I am not sure. I started a research lab in May and I am absolutely miserable in it. The only reason I did it was because every other pre\\\\-med with my major started doing it and I got stressed and felt like I was behind. I don't know what to do right now cause I feel I have dug myself too deep with all of the things I have started and all of the connections I have made. I told my advisor about this but she said that it's not a good idea to quit anything right now as I would be burning bridges, but I have just never felt this anxious and sad about something. I'm most worried about realizing too late what I want to do and having to take several gap years or something. When did you guys figure out what you wanted to do? For those of you who found out later, did you end up being successful/happy?

I just got into OSU and am super excited at the possibility of being a Buckeye. I will be choosing between OSU and IU and have a few questions... Is it true that the Fisher school of business is \"on the rise\"? IU\\'s business school is ranked ~10 and OSU\\'s is ~30. But I have read that by the time I graduate OSU\\'s will be similarly ranked.  How hard is it to get internships out of Fisher?  Is it hard to get student football/basketball tickets?

Please do not drive such professors away with your incessant back-biting and child-like enthusiasm for complaints. I understand how you might get frustrated with some low-quality teaching, and it cannot be avoided in a behemoth like this. But there are many who care for you, and for their sake at least, please stop complaining about courses being hard, about grades being unfair, and about content being boring...Sometimes, content has to be boring to make you realize what you are in for..and hopefully, you will realize it is not for you, and do something else that will make you happy.

As a transfer student I had to take business admin 1100. In the class they pretty much teach you about OSU and all the other good stuff. Now the professor is also our advisor which is key. In the first week of classes, we were told that we had to choose our majors for fisher. I was not aware of this because I was India the first week. I had let the professor know that I would be missing the first week and if we are doing anything important the first class. She said no and I didn't think much of it.

I email my advisor asking why I was still Pre bus only for her to tell me that I never declared a major.

We saw that there was a large response to your Hackathon at the library in November, so we wanted to invite CSE students to compete for large prizes!

Whether you know one programming language or twenty, you're invited! The best part - it's free for university students. And if there's enough people from OSU, there will be a free bus. So tell all of your friends and tell any interested clubs for us! We currently have 700 registrations - put your .edu email into [hackillinois.org]([url link] and RSVP to our [Facebook event]([url link] to sign up now!

What tends to be the trend is doubles especially on North Campus become partially full because singles with low numbers fill them halfway without finding a roommate first, so then you have a large number of half full doubles making it hard for pre-made pairs to room together. The other big issue is groups of four filling 6-person suites and leaving two rooms open in their suite so a good option for pairs who can’t get a double together is often to fill in one of these 6-man suites. We had friends who wanted a 6-man on North, but ended up only having options available on South campus by the time they picked at ~3,500.

The house itself is right behind Buckeye Donuts, and my room is the largest room on the third floor of the house. Washer and dryer are in the house, and the 4 other guys who live here are all pretty cool.  Less than half a block away from campus, nice location - rent is $720 a month. If you're interested in swapping leases/rooms to a pet friendly place send a PM and let's see if we can work something out. I can pay a month's rent upfront, or pay the difference between what this place costs and what you're willing to pay, as well as provide moving services/labor. I suppose my hope is that somebody isn't satisfied with their living situation and wants a spot near campus, or perhaps some new friends.  Total shot in the dark here, what's likely going to end up happening (if I can't find anybody willing to take me up on this offer) is that I'm going to have to take her to a friends place, and then my parent's house when break comes around (out-of-state student).  I know that by posting this I pretty much open myself up to whatever jokes that might come my way, but hey it was a good stretch while it lasted - totally worth it.

Anyway, so I was thinking about knocking out physics 1250 over this summer at a community college back home. The only thing is, I'm worried if I come back in the fall/spring of next year and take 1251 here I'll be in trouble in terms of preparedness (In the same vain of taking 1151 at C-State and taking 1172 here). Is this something to be worried about or are the classes different material entirely? Should I try to take 1251 over the summer instead? Thanks for your help guys! <eos> \", \"<bos> Hey! Sophomore here taking CSE 2221 right now and am taking 2231 and 2321 in the upcoming Summer. I wanted to ask the current students who are pursuing a BS in CSE just as I am if the classes you take are all just Software or if there is also Hardware classes? I originally decided to do CSE because i love modifying and enhancing computer and video game hardware. But then i realized i'm pretty good at coding and ended up liking it too. Did i take the wrong major? lol. Let me know what you guys have to say! EDIT: I did some looking around on the Electrical  Computer Engineering Department website and found that there is the Computer Engineering Program of Study. I am now seriously considering this transition. I'd love to hear what people have to say on this. EDIT EDIT: I have decided to stick with CSE because it would take me an extra year to catch up with the ECE classes i would have to take. For Technical Electives only 8 have to be in CSE and 7 others can be taken from other areas approved by an advisor, so maybe i could find a few ECE classes to fulfill those electives. <eos> \", '<bos> Got a flyer in the Oval encouraging me to vote no on issue 2.

This is without a doubt the worst class I've taken here. As an engineering major, I'm always excited to take a class that's outside of my field, to break up the solid math and physics. I took theatre voluntarily, and I couldn't be more unhappy with it. I have nothing against the actual class, but Ms. Lee failed completely as an instructor. It feels like she makes the class harder on purpose. No notes or slides are posted online, because she knows otherwise her lecture would be empty, since she reads straight off her slides and doesn't provide anything additional. She also doesn't make the past quizzes available to study from, even though she clearly states that she takes questions from them for the exam.  Professor Lee also takes every opportunity to turn even the most innocent subject into some sort of social commentary. A good half of her lectures turn into a discussion of feminism. I am all about gender equality, and I don't feel like I should be lectured about something I already agree with. If I wanted to take a class on feminism, I would do so. Lastly, she has no classroom awareness. Lecture is in Independence, with a couple hundred people at least. Yet she still will pout and complain if anyone is having a conversation in class, and even get angry if anyone tries to leave even a minute early. I understand that this is disrespectful, but as a professor I think you should be able to deal with these realities of lecturing hundreds of students at a time, not put class on hold and yell at the students as a whole. If anyone took this class and disagrees with me, I welcome comments. I'm just very discouraged with this class and I can't believe a university like ours would employ such an immature and inept professsor. <eos> \", '<bos>  [url link] If you’d like to search a specific address check out this map: [url link]   <eos> ', '<bos> I\\'m graduating this semester with no definite plans yet besides \"apply to some school sometime in the future and maybe land a \\'real job\\' at some point\\'\".

I've quite literally fucked up in the fact that I'm retaking it using grade forgiveness on a C+ I had gotten last semester. The worse I'll do is a C but unless I crush this final i'm realistically looking at a C+ (again). Both professors focused on completely different aspects of ochem (previous professor had a hard on for mech's) but it honestly only explains my performance on MT1 which i got slightly above the 73% average. MT2 came around and i bombed the shit out of it, up to that time there were family issues going on at home which distracted me significantly. I was advised by my adviser to petition for a withdraw for a different class which i preformed just as poorly on ( Basically when things got bad at home i bombed two midterms at the time, the week before i had gotten 102% on a midterm for a different class). The petition was approved but this freed up time to focus on ochem and do better came a little late, the holes just too deep and once the petition was approved I only had 2 weeks to now. I've prepared a lot for this exam but I'm stressed out. I'll stop my caffeine induced rambling but i was on track for at least a B in the course until MT2. With a high probability of a C+ i just don't see how i can explain to adcoms why i did just as poorly in a retaken class. I don't see my application to MD schools being even the slightest bit competitive now and the fact I'm retaking and most likely doing just as bad means it wont help in a DO application either. I've learned a lot on what I lacked and where my faults were in how i went about studying etc so the retake wasn't a complete loss personally but none of that matters in an application to med school.

If you're flying solo, please select a room with another single occupant before taking an empty double. We don't need groups of two getting locked out of doubles because nobody wants to be the guy to jump in with a random roommate. Not like you're going to get an unofficial single anyway, Housing will probably just throw a freshman in there if nobody picks it. Mostly mentioning this because I honestly would probably do it myself if I didn't have a roommate lined up.     2. In a similar vein, don't take empty suites if you can't more or less fill them. I get the impression there are a lot more large group than there are suites, so let's try and let as many of those groups get suites that fit them as possible. So if you're a group of 3, either get a 4-person suite or a few doubles; don't hog a suite that could fit 6 or 8 because there are undoubtedly a bunch of 6 - 8 person groups that are eyeing those.    I know there are some people that want the humanities types to stay South and let the engineers have North, but I think that's a load of bullshit. Don't want to go back to the old North campus where it's a bunch of engineers not talking to each other.

SCE is a resource for people who have been sexually harassed or assaulted or need to talk about something like that. For reasons still unknown, it is under review and osu expects people who used this as a resource to call CCS or SARNCO or some other source. Well CCS here is shit. They are always backed up and don't have enough time to give everyone the time that they need and deserve. SARNCO is backed up as well and what can they do about the problems here on campus. What if the victim is in the same class as the perpetrator? They can't do anything about that. SCE can but that resource is no longer there. Also, osu didn't even put out a statement about the investigation when it started. Seriously OSU. I'm so disappointed.

So I'm beginning to plan my schedule for next semester (I'm a first year) and I was wondering if the sororities on campus all meet on the same night? And if they do, what night/time is it? I have friends at other schools who are missing their first semester of meetings because they unknowingly scheduled classes for the same time and I'm hoping to avoid that.  Also - do you recommend joining sororities? I'm on the fence. I plan on going through recruitment because it seems like a good thing to do. However, I'm worried about it a bit. I've been struggling socially, mainly because I didn't join the party scene and struggle with some anxiety issues. I'm hoping a sisterhood will help, but will those issues cause more problems if I'm in a sorority?

The apartment is a large 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom duplex (2500 sq ft) one block east of High Street in Clintonville, rent for the room is a steal at ONLY $290. Utilities not included, but usually range from $50-$100, depending on the season. For the price and location, it just doesn't get any better. Access to the Olentangy bike trail and COTA bus line that takes you directly to campus are just two blocks away. If you have a car, there is ample street parking (no permit required). Less than a half a mile walk to Kroger, Walhalla Ravine, Glen Echo Park, Cornerstone Cafe, Dough Mama, Local Cantina, Lineage Brewery and Bonchon.  In addition, we have a covered front porch, fenced in back yard with fire pit, WD hook-ups and a full basement if you need extra storage. Our neighbor is a sweet retired school teacher who sends us valentines and occasional treats. We don't party quite like Chittenden, but we'll still enjoy a few beverages to relax and unwind. Potential roommates must have a good level of cleanliness and sorry, no pets (unless it is a registered therapy animal)! Available for move in June through August 1st, at the very latest.

While I was gone, they changed the ECE requirement so that the new ECE sequence I'll be taking is 2 credits less, but we still need to make up the 2 credits by taking more tech electives.

The grades will be published today or tomorrow in SIS. We had a lot of very good grades! Recall that we do not curve per se (that is, add a number to all scores), but we do consider the class average. We take this average, subtract it from the class high score, and divide it by 6 to obtain the incremental increase for the C+ to A grade cuts. For the bottom, we start by subtracting 500 points from the average and dividing that by 4 for the incremental decrease for grades C to D. We then look for largish gaps in the total scores for our final recommended cuts (so a few points do not cost anyone a grade). The Vice Chair for Undergraduate Studies for the department compares all the 1220 classes this term and he makes the final grade cuts. It is department policy not to publish the final grade cuts. .......... If I only got 725.8 points, does this mean she's going to RAISE my grade 6.75% or decrease it by that much? I just want to know if my grade will curve up half a percent to a C.  <eos> \", '<bos> Wow, he was so cool and friendly. He did a real good job bagging the groceries for my cart.

As of last week, the University became involved in a formal contract dispute dealing with the drilling and construction of the geothermal wells.  Over the past 50 years a great deal of information about the hydrogeology, paleokarst horizons, and high yields of wells completed in the Newburg Zone within the Silurian-Devonian Carbonate Aquifer has been published in theses, dissertations, government reports, professional journals, reference books, and textbooks, all of which can be found in libraries across the state and much of it accessed via the internet. Because the synthesis and graphic portrayal of these data in my seminar materials could be used in possible, upcoming litigation, I have been to cancel my seminar talk. I regret any scheduling inconveniences the seminar cancellation may cause you.   E. Scott Bair  **tl;dr - The school and the geothermal drilling company are disputing over the contract.

Davis Clock Tower. The LCD screen is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the pixels will go over a typical viewer\\'s head. There\\'s also Tom\\'s altruistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his tower - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Michael V. Drake literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these visuals, to realize that they\\'re not just bright- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike the Tom W. Davis Clock Tower truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\\'t appreciate, for instance, the emotional profoundness in the Tower\\'s existential catchphrase \"Thank you Tom!,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\\'s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\\'m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tom W. Davis\\'s genius unfolds itself on their clock tower screen. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Tom W. Davis Clock Tower tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\\'s for the ladies\\' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they\\'re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. <eos> ', '<bos> So I just got caught tonigr drinking in my dorm.

I have a car and am not opposed to living further out and driving to campus daily (I'll have access to a B parking pass). It might actually be preferable, since I'm not straight out of undergrad and not really looking to extend the undergrad lifestyle, haha. I'm preferably looking for 1 bedrooms, but studios aren't totally out of the question either.  I'd appreciate input on management companies or even just neighborhoods in general.

I'm looking to return to school to get a BS in CSE at Ohio State.

Especially when you are trying to group study and need a place where you can talk to each other, it is even worse. So I am going to post some of my knowledge of the spaces I discovered, so please contribute. Good luck on all your exams! 1. Orton geology library (till 5) 2. Smith lab 1st floor study room 3. Smith lab classrooms. Go to 4th or 5th floor, just go into an empty classroom. 4. Cockins hall 1st floor and 2nd floor MSLC tutor rooms (just go in one- just sit in the corner and work on what ever you have) 5. Kennedy commons (12th ave bread company) basement has lots of rooms and desks in the hall. Also, the loft over the bread company has desks and you can study there too. 6. Go into a dorm (you don't have to live there) and use the study rooms there. 7. Go to the 2nd floor of McDonalds on High street. They don't care. Just buy a coke and you're good. 8. There is a long bench on 1st floor of McPherson if deskless your thing. 9. The health and sciences library 10. Just go into an empty room in Mason Hall 1st floor. You might get kicked out though. 11. Mason hall also has a circular room next to rohr cafe. Try it out. If your lurk enough, you can find spots in Thompson and SEL, but group study or trying to sit with someone else is impossible... So there, I hope this helps. And really, Cockins is really good. Just try not to walk past a greeter since they'll ask you to sign in. Just find an empty room and walk in.

I rented it not knowing that I would need it again in math 1172. Does anybody know if any future math classes also require this textbook? If not, I will rent it again. But if I need it yet again in the future, it would be cheaper for me to buy it outright.  Also, does anybody happen to know if it is substantially different than the non-osu custom edition?

I had some personal issues if my own that included depression and a resulting drug problem that made doing school extremely hard for me. I took a basic class in the summer and got a 4.0 which raised my gpa to 2.6. In the fall semester I tried once again to do engineering and came up short and got sent to coam for a homework assignment. After that semester I was put on special action probation and needed a 2.3 in the spring semester. Right now I’m looking at finishing with a 2.26 and I’m freaking out about whether or I’ll be dismissed. I turned my life around after the fall semester and relatively ended my drug problem and started to make strides in school, but my track record here is bad. If I end up not finishing above a 2.3 am I definitely going to get kicked out? I’ve never had to deal with something like a drug problem and depression and I tried to fix it in time but I’m worried I don’t fix it in time.  <eos> ', \"<bos> I was originally planning on taking 4 hours of summer classes but switched down to 3, so I am expecting a $450 refund but haven't received it yet.

This summer, she and I made necklaces out of beads and buckeye nuts while her little brother napped. I used it to reinforce the lessons on patterns in between the buckeye nuts (some necklaces would have a scarlet-gray-scarlet-gray pattern, others would have scarlet-scarlet-gray-gray).  So now we have extra necklaces and I thought it'd be fun for her to try to sell them as though it was a lemonade stand. How much do they typically cost?

Does anyone know when you receive refund checks from the university? Some call them \"overage\" checks.

My current gpa is 3.41, recovering after a 3.0 my first semester last fall.  No excuses for my poor performance, but long story short I recieved a C- in math 1148. Now, a C- is the minimum grade to move on to the next course in the sequence, 1131 (business calc) which I am currently enrolled in for this fall. I am confident that I have learned many things in the past year that leave me much more equipped to perform as a student, therefore I anticipate a much better grade in business calc. My question, though, is if I have to take 1148 over because I earned a C-.  This is directly from the Fisher website : \"Completion of Math 1131 or 1151 or equivalent and prerequisites with grades of C or better\". So if I received an A or B in 1131 and end the semester with, at the lowest, a 3.5 GPA, will I even be able to apply? I hesitate to ask Fisher themselves as if I did continue and performed well in 1131, I would not even be able to retake 1148 because of the higher credit.  Am I even allowed to retake a C-? Even if it allows me on to the next course?  Also, is it possible for a current \"non-Fisher student\" to talk to a business advisor? It wouldn\\'t allow me to schedule an appointment.

I find I push myself a lot harder when I lift with a friend/spotter. It's also great having the accountability of a lifting partner to carry each other through lapses in motivation. If this sounds like your thing then comment/pm me and we can talk more.  I like going most evenings around 8/9/10 when the gyms are less crowded. Usually go to RPAC but open to JO north and ARC as well. I have a garage pass and am open to carpooling if convenient. More details: M/26/6'1/175lbs.

We are looking for any 21+ student who would like to become a part-time bartender to work the weekend shifts. * No experience is necessary. * We only serve beer (no cocktails or wine), so it's quite easy. * Any knowledge or enthusiasm for beer is a bonus. * You would make minimum wage ($4.15/hr for tipped employees), but the tips are pretty great since it's only 1 bartender/shift. Tips typically range from $100-$200, but can be better or worse depending on the night. It's the service industry - so the more charm the better! * Shifts include: Fridays 4-10p, Saturday 12-5p and 5-11p, Sunday 12-6p. * Need to work 1 shift/weekend minimum. The more the better. * Start date: ASAP * Duration of employment: we would ideally like to hire someone who is willing to work throughout the school year.

Neither myself or the other person who I have shared my pass with has been ticketed, ever. When I say share I mean that both your car and my car [identified via license plates] will be under a single account. During my time sharing a pass I have had days where we have had both cars on campus at the same time, actually this happened quite often, and sometimes even parked right next to one another. As I stated earlier, no tickets ever. Unfortunately, this past year all my friends had graduated and I have yet to find someone who is willing to go half way on a parking pass with me. I believe the current going rate for a parking pass is $327. If you are interested please shoot me a message and we can talk about it further.

Now for a while I have been doing mechanical and currently a whole different type of engineering For a check the box, resume weed out thing for engineering a degree is essential. But as for being beneficial to what it is I actually did I would say it was a waste of time and money for most part. I’d argue 1 to 2 years at MOST out of 5 was beneficial. Most of the classes were either fluff and/or I could just have got the same knowledge renting a book from the library and reading. Having a prof and a class added no value. And most of the classes you do the work for the grade and immediately forget Physics courses were basically a repeat of HS. Chem course ditto Intro to engineering was only valuable in parts to learn auto desk inventor and Matlab. The 3view drawing stuff was more basic than my mechanical drafting class in HS My major thermo and heat transfer and to an extent gas dynamics were good (prefer a better prof for gas). But the rest I couldn’t hear and or they were so all over the place I couldn’t understand  The GECs were useless. English classes didn’t really require effort  ECE was a repeat of second physics Mech E classes were repeats of physics Math was good.  College was a good experience from a social fun type experience. But from a useful knowledge type stuff it was largely a waste of time and money.

Baker East and West (No A/C, not renovated, bad location) 7. Lincoln Tower (A/C, horrible location) 8.

I woke up the next morning with a ticket on my windshield and knowing how CampusParc takes souls, I was expecting a hefty fine.

We will be placing signs in the coming days so this is not an issue in the future.  I’ve never been so happy in my life.

I have moved to Pittsburgh to start a new job, but left my roommate in our apartment near OSU campus. I was paying on my share of the rent until he was able to find a new roommate. However, he shared with me this past weekend that he was no longer able to pay his share and was leaving the apartment due to medical reasons. So, we moved out, but this has broken our lease early and, since he does not have the means to pay, leaves me with paying all fees until it is rented to new tenants or be sent to collections. Therefor, this is a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in the Stadium View complex, just west of OSU campus. It is on the top floor of a three floor building. It is off of campus, but an easy walk to get to school. Neighbors are mostly grad students, or small families, and very quiet. Maintenance is friendly and issues are fixed normally within 1 day of making them aware. It is pet friendly, with an extra deposit, the kitchen has a dish washer, and the living room is large. Both rooms have nice sized closets. The rent for us was $775 a month, but I think they are currently running deals for that to be a little cheaper. Trash and water are included in rent, and both Time Warner and WOW are available for cable. Again, this apartment is available as soon as it is turned over by the landlord, most likely this week, and needs new renters as soon as possible. Please PM me if you are interested so that we can organize with the leasing agent to get you into the correct apartment. Edit: The address is 858 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, Oh 43212. There is coin op laundry in the building and off street parking. <eos> ', \"<bos> I dug through the course offerings in CSE that have specific prerequisites, the idea being to be able to set up the next semester in the best possible way.

However, I'm interested in computers, and I was considering computer information science for the longest time.

I was always under the impression that CSE focuses on both hardware and software, while CIS was strictly software; however, that viewpoint has changed based on what that student particularly said. My questions are these: What exactly is the difference between these two majors? What would be the career differences / salaries between these two?

I have a study abroad trip coming up from late July until mid August, and I understand students who are on disciplinary probation cannot participate in most study abroad programs. This specific program is individually organized through a 3rd party that I was allowed to use STEP money for. It\\'s kind of a unique program that isn\\'t credit bearing but rather service-oriented. Absolutely everything is paid for, from program fees to the flights themselves. Regardless though, I\\'m really stressed out about being barred from going since I used STEP money to pay for it. OSU-sponsored (\"1st party\") are programs that I would not be allowed on; this one is a 3rd party but one paid for with that STEP money that is \"sort of\" organized through the office of international affairs, even though I\\'ve applied separately and performed all monetary transactions through the 3rd party, having almost no contact with OSU. No one can answer whether I\\'ll be barred from going other than the Office of Student Affairs considering how out of the ordinary this study abroad program is. What I wanted to ask is if anyone thinks I should even ask them. I read on the study abroad website that eligibility is checked during the application process as well as the term leading up to the study abroad. I\\'m in a sort of middle ground of those two, so I might get away with them not double checking my eligibility.

It almost seems like outside of football, people don't care as much about school sports however that's just what I've seen on TV from basketball games and I was wondering what those of you who are attending feel about that.

What happened was tragic and I would never joke about something like that. My question is what is the highest accessible point of campus? I just need to sit and think about stuff awhile. If you could tell me if there is any secluded but safe place that I could just be alone for awhile that would suffice.  UPDATE: I feel obligated to tell anyone that may come across this after what happened today (April 8th, 2018) that I am ok. What happened today and Thursday is extremely tragic and and saddening.

I'm now at the business school and doing much better. Now if for my resume or if I apply to a job that asks for my GPA, it's only a 3.0 due to those bad engineering grades. If they only included business school classes, it would be like a 3.7 or so. Is there anywhere that will show such a GPA that only includes the classes in my major?

As cashiers we try to tell people that so and so is $x and you can fill up your block, but some people don't budge. I know it's not my business what people do with their money/blocks but it just seems foolish to me.

It is going to, however, require that I take spring quarter off.

How do I go about doing this with the university as far as not being there spring quarter, but still being a student. Is it as simple as not registering for spring quarter classes like you do if you go home for the summer? How do I let university housing know I'm moving out a quarter early?

I did about 2/3 of the hours, but got too busy to complete the rest. I have been working two jobs (one is at night) this semester, plus a full course load (science major), and I struggle really badly with generalized anxiety and chronic depression. I tried to find treatment through OSU but have been put on a waitlist for a semester and a half so far - despite the fact that counseling services will give out free walk-in sessions to all students after every campus incident. This site is so fast-paced and stressful that it is a literal hellhole for anyone with anxiety disorders. Plus I have no car so I am forced to take a series of public buses (1 hour travel time each way), which is also terrible. I dread going and am always so tired, which is why I made excuses not to go and ended up without enough hours. What sucks is that I would have had a 96 in this class without this incident. Does anyone have any advice on what to expect in my meeting, as far as grades and punishment? Also, I have two academic scholarships - do you think they'll be taken away?

In my experience, the prices go down as the leasing year goes on because they get more desperate to sign people on. Often times they\\'ll throw in bonuses like giftcards and other incentives. If you talk to someone in leasing and they tell you stuff like \"I can\\'t guarantee you X because were we have Y other people looking at it.\" More than likely it just the leasing office rep being sleazy about trying to hurry you into a lease, It takes them forever to sign people on.

I live in Lincoln, which I feel hinders friend making in a couple ways. First of all, it is honors so in general people are less out-going and social, and second, the way the suites are structured makes it pretty much impossible to pop your head in and meet people or say hi. I know almost everyone on my floor, but it's tough to really hang out with people or get to know anyone. My roommates are fine, and we share some common interests, but they're very introverted and don't want to make friends or meet anyone, so I'm forced to do it alone. The rest of my suitemates are buddied up with their respective roommates, and also have little interest making new friends. I'm the only person in my suite that wants to get to know people and make friends, so I'm forced to do it alone. I pretty much know everyone on my floor, but none of them on any sort of personal level, pretty much just well enough that I know their names and they know mine, we talk when we see each other, but never actually hang out or anything.  I've tried hanging out in my suite's common area with the door open, and I've talked to a lot of people by doing that.

Hey everyone, Since the term is over and my roommate and I are still gonna be around this summer, we've been tossing this idea of a podcast around in our head as a summer project. Figured we could start it out just fine on our own but are not opposed to adding more people to the mix. Here are some of our podcast influences for this: H3H3 Podcast, Funhaus, Super Best Friendcast, Coffee With Clemps, Co-Optional Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast The subjects we're looking forward to discussing are video games, things going on on youtube, and basically all sorts of nerd stuff and other things that come with that. After my exam on Tuesday, I'll be looking into if we can use Denney Hall's audio/video studio as our base of operations since they are available for rental times.  Right now its lookin at probably a commitment of one day for anywhere between 1 to 2 1/2 hours every 1 or 2 weeks. Once we get rolling we'd have a better idea so these are just our estimates. If you're interested we'd be glad to meet up and talk about it more and work out some details. Suggestions are also welcome! If you're interested then shoot me a message on Reddit.

We are currently living in a house and have 2-3 open spots: 1 full room and 1 very spacious basement that can fit 2 people and has it's own bathroom. Laundry facilities are located in the building and do cost about $1 for a wash and dry together, cheaper than off-campus laundromats. It's technically 2 houses so there are two kitchens and four bathrooms, one on every floor. There is also a porch. Very spacious living room. It's located on E. Northwood not far from High St, so campus is walkable distance. Rent comes down to $522/mo not including utilities ($50-$70/month but it's generally only on the more expensive side in the winter). Housing is cheaper if you want to share the basement with a friend at $460/mo. It's very nice and large. No pets, and smoking is allowed outside. Current residents are friendly and mostly gamers who usually enjoy drinking and having a good time on the weekends. A few are going to be students next year, others will be working on and around campus. There are four parking spots included, and next year only 2 will have cars.

After getting into some of the classes and meeting some of the people, I realized that I should back to my math and science ways. But because of the 5 year COOP program, I decided to switch to OSU so I could do it in 4 as opposed to 6 (1 year for random classes and 5 years for the engineering program). Transferred to OSU Newark LATE December 2013(awhile ago I know) and lived at home because I moved within 2 weeks of starting and couldn't get anything close to campus. For the fall, I got an apartment with the GF who decided to move back home with her family in VA. So I am currently in an apartment by myself until July, when I move out. So here's the question: I never really made any friends until this semester b/c of my 100+ people lecture classes, and I traveled like 20 mins by car to get to my apartment, so I kind of kept to myself and talked to the couple of friends I had already. I want to get involved on campus with activities like I did at UC, but feel like a Junior in a dorm would be kind of awkward. And while I have friends around, most of them already have living arrangements for the fall. So my other option would be to get a 1 bed apartment to live by myself. A final option would be to move back home so I could save some money and pay off student loans. The downside is that the drive is still 20 minutes away, so I would be very far away from campus.

Up until now I’ve just been jogging for ~45 minutes a day, which I’ve been doing less and less as of late. I’d like to start a daily workout routine, but I’m kind of lost with all the new equipment available to me.  I’ll probably try to do a daily jog, either in the morning (8 am classes whoop) or in the evening, and run on treadmills on bad weather days. I’m not super concerned with building muscle, though I hate having wet noodles for arms. So, do you workout, and if so, what is your routine? Also, do you workout alone, or do you always do it with a friend? <eos> ', \"<bos> So...I was working on my honors contract a long time ago. Then I stopped for a long time because I was really considering adding another major. I've decided to do so, but to make it official I have to meet with my advisor and I can't do it until April 6th. The deadline is April 3rd. I guess from the site it has to be done by the end of the semester.  I also forgot I had to meet with my departmental honors advisors and prob can't get meetings for another week or so.

I have honors scheduling and I heard that doesn't change if you don't continue with honors which is good, but to be safe or just get extra priority, I'm hoping to get senior status by the end of the summer, I'm a sophomore.

Sorry to be a pain, but I\\'m a freshman planning out my schedule for next semester and I\\'m a bit confused. On my advising report, my survey professor wrote that one of the classes I should take is English 1110 or bio 1113/1114. I would like to take bio, but that would leave me needing to take English 1110 next autumn. I was wondering, can I even do this because the class is called \"first-year English composition?\" I\\'m not sure if it\\'s limited to first years or not.

I'm currently in it and he never updates anything on Carmen.. How am I supposed to figure out what I have in the class? Does he curve usually?

Stress is starting to get to me and I used to play the piano to help deal with it, but I haven't been able to find one here on campus.

I'm looking at meal plans right now but I'm having a hard time figuring them out. Basically I'm between either the Grey 10 or the Declining balance plan, anyone have any insight on the value of these two? I'm planning on probably making my own breakfast, usually eating lunch on campus, then either eating dinner at my place or eating on campus.

So I am wondering if OSU can take back my admission after I've accepted admission, or if I'm just worrying too much. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Are the leases usually for 12 months only? Apartment or house? What are the best affordable locations?

I wanted as a keepsake for one, but also to get student discounts at piada and maybe go to a football game with my girlfriend who's still a student. I doubt I would be able to get a new one since I graduated and am no longer enrolled but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a way I didn't know about.

What style of dining hall do you guys suggest working in? I'm open to any style (marketplace, traditional,whatever) but what environment do you guys think is better? (I'm living on north campus, btw if you need a location.) 2)Should I even bother applying for a job? I have ZERO work experience from high school. I volunteered hundreds of hours, but I chose when I showed up and things were pretty flexible-it was nothing like a real job. Will I be able to find an on campus job despite my lack of workplace experience? 3) As a freshman, is it a good idea for me to get a job at the beginning of the year? Or should I wait until I have a set routine? Is it difficult to find a job on campus later in the year? 4) Any other general comments about on campus jobs at osu? Thanks for your input! I really appreciate you taking time to answer my questions!  <eos> \", '<bos> I’m a 2nd year at OSU and I’m not happy with my social life at this point. I have mostly acquaintances, and some friends who I can hang out 1-on-1 with, but I really just want a solid *group* of friends, you know, one where we all hang out together a lot of the time, not just hanging out with separate people 1-on-1 who don’t know each other. I figure getting into a frat is the best way to do this, but I have some reservations.  I’m not a huge partier or drinker. I like to once in a while, and I’m always down for a beer, but partying regularly, getting shitfaced, drugs, etc. is not my thing. I also don’t have a fake so I can’t go out to bars/clubs that require ID to get in anyways.  Also not interested in getting hazed. I know no one really wants to get hazed, but I think the claim that it’s good for bonding is BS. You can bond in better ways than getting hazed. I would never haze someone else, so I don’t really want to be friends with people who’d want to do it to me.  I’m just super against the whole typical always partying, getting shitfaced, hooking up, hazing frat. I know the stereotype is usually overplayed, but I’ve also seen it be completely accurate at times here at OSU.  I just want a good group of friends that I can hang out with and go do stuff with regularly, maybe drink occasionally, go lift with, go to football games together, study together, go play some sports for fun (noncompetitively), etc.  So... sorry for the novel, but what frats would fit me best here at OSU?  **tl;dr:** need a frat that doesn’t fit the fratboy stereotype but also isn’t lame  <eos> ', \"<bos> Hey OSU, I wanted to post this so I could gain some personal advice and also serve as a reference for people also experiencing the housing anxiety. I am an incoming freshman into the Fisher school of business and am looking for my perfect dorm. I plan on doing intramural sports, having a fun time on campus, but still do well on my studies. I love to socialize and make friends with whoever I can talk to, and plan to leave my door open all the time. I was wondering if I could get some advice on where to submit my preferences from a former student or someone who knows the campus well. In a nutshell, I want a hall that isn't too long of a walk to classes, with a classic college dorm feel, where I can make friends and be in a nice comfortable dorm with one other person.
