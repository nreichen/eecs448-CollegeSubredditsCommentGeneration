            "<bos> Hi all! I'm a high school junior, and I've always been interested in Madison. I visited last August and absolutely fell in love with the city and the campus. I'd like to know any info about the Communications program here. I've always been interested in the television/film business, and getting a degree and possibly working in the field has been a dream of mine for a while. I'd also kind of like to know if I'd be able to get in to Madison. (I know, typical high-schooler question.) I have a 3.84 GPA as of last semester, and I just got a 29 on the ACT. I've been in stage crew since freshman year, and I'll be in my school's National Honor Society chapter next year. I also might join AFS and possibly Forensics next year. I've always felt not smart enough to get in, because I know Madison is pretty competitive, but maybe that's just me being self-deprecating. Thank you for any and all advice you can give! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi I'm an undergrad studying CS and recently I got interests in spatial programming/GIS/GPS. I've explored some courses in the geography department and found out that GEOG 377, 378 or 574 might align with CS topics and have some programming aspects. Given that I have some basic experience in Python and willing to learn ArcGIS before the semester starts, what would be the general workload for GEOG 377/378? also would it be manageable to take both courses in one semester with the other CS course(with some heavy programming projects).  Also any ideas about the general depth of GIS courses in the university will be much appreciated ! Thank you!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey folks, just got back my undergrad decision for UWMadison and I was a little crushed to see it was a waitlist. Is it likely for waitlisted students to be let in? Would talking to the admissions office increase my chances? I really like UW Madison, I thought my scores were a direct ticket there but I'm just totally reeling after getting waitlisted <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, I'm going to fail a class this semester. I messed up and took on more than I could handle, thinking I would be able to pull things off until long after the drop date. Basically, I ended up not really going to class, which I get is totally on me; I probably won't go to the professor/TA because I honestly just didn't try in the class and I deserve an F. My question is, what happens now? Despite the F, I'm on track to get a 2.4-2.7 GPA this semester, which is good. Will I be placed on academic probation, or is that just if my GPA drops below 2 as a whole? The class is a gen ed, and not directly related to my major.  Additionally, I'm studying abroad next semester (Spring 2016). Will failing a class this fall affect that at all? I've been accepted into the program on all fronts, already have my plane ticket, etc. I'm also certain that I'll be able to get above a 3.0 for the rest of my college career.  Any help with any of these questions would be awesome! Sincerely, a scared student  TL;DR I am going to fail a class. Talking to the prof is not an option. Will still have a ~2.5 GPA. What will happen to me? Academic probation or nah? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Everyone has that one class or professor that if they could go back in time and avoid taking either, what class/professor would it be? For example: my biggest regret was taking biology 151, should have taken biology 101/102/130 sequence, would have been so much easier and looked exactly the same on a transcript since both are elementary level courses! Curious as to everyone else's opinions! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Has anyone taken Music 151 without any musical knowledge prior? I was looking at taking a very intro level music theory class just due to interest, but did not want to bite off more than I can chew with a class that would be suited moreso to people with prior music experience. The only music experience I really have is reading guitar tabs and reading sheet music when I played the trumpet in 6th grade. Would this class be something I could, relatively easily, handle, or would I be swamped? What are your experiences with this class? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, i'm a new grad student at UW and relatively new to the area. Most of my established hobbies (ie: racing cars, building computers) are full of mostly guys. Since starting grad school, i've been trying to put myself into clubs (ie: ballroom dancing) to meet more diverse people and maybe try to get into a relationship.  The problem is, as a grad student, I am having a hard time tending to any of my hobbies or going to any club meetings, let alone trying to find someone to build a relationship with. I have tried dating apps and found them to be very unreliable as dates often flake out and profiles can be misleading. Are there any good places I can go (probably by myself) to meet people on the weekends?  Tldr: What's the best place to meet and find potential dates as a busy grad student? / share your graduate dating experience.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi! So I got accepted to UW yesterday and will most likely be going there. I'm from India and was wondering which dorm is the best... I'll be majoring in CS, and I'm a girl.Will dorms have co-ed floors or separate floors for guys and girls? I don't like partying so much but I don't mind it as long as it's not a nuisance. I would prefer only double dorms. Also, which dorms have a large international community? Thanks, guys!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello all.  I am currently a high school senior and I was recently offered admission to the School of Agriculture and Life Sciences at UW-Madison. My first choice major was Computer Engineering, but they accepted me into my second choice, which was \"Machinery Systems Engineering\" on my common app. I didn't realize this was in the school of agriculture and I would really like to transfer into the school of engineering if I decide to go to Madison.  What would be the process for that and what would I need to do to have the best chance of getting in to ENGR? How easy/hard is it to transfer? I'm just worried that if I don't get into engineering I will be stuck in a major I really do not want to study since the transfer isn't guaranteed. <eos> \n",

It used to be the case (I took it in Spring 2016) that you got credit for going and reading the piece of paper they handed out, but I've heard the class has undergone some changes. My question is: is the class still as enjoyable as it was before, or is the fun ruined? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Not sure if this is the right place, but I recently moved to a new apartment building with a gym, and I'm trying to get rid of my membership. The membership is good until May 2019 and right now is at the East Campus Mall location. It's $39/mo. I will pay the $49 fee to transfer it to you. ETA: The membership isn't paid for until May 2019 - the $39/mo price is good until May 2019. You'd still have to pay the monthly costs. Sorry, it's not free :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I’m an incoming freshman and I’m taking CS 302 and the WES-CS seminar my fall semester. I want to explore the field of computer science to see if I enjoy it. Also, since I have very little prior programming experience, will this class be difficult for me? I’ve been exposed to the Swift language, but the most I remember are the data types and how to create loops and if/else statements. Is this CS 302 a good indication of whether I will like computer science if I do well/enjoy it? Or will I need to take CS 367 to determine that? I’m also taking math 171 this semester. I know math 221 is recommended but I’ve never taken calc in high school, which is why I went with a lower level. I know computer science is very math-intensive, and I’ve always been in “regular” math classes for most of high school. I took an honors precalc course my senior year, and I earned an A, but I had to bust my ass to do it. I enjoy solving problems and getting the correct answers, but math has not been enjoyable for me since I often had to grasp and understand the material on my own (my math teachers in high school were not very good at teaching). So, I feel like if I’m average at best when it comes to math, then computer science isn’t for me. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi everyone! I am really desperate for students and graduates 18 years or older to take a survey for my masters dissertation on rural Americans' knowledge of and attitudes about study opportunities abroad. If you are 18 or older, grew up in a rural area, and are either a current student, recent graduate, or about to start a new higher education program (Bachelor's or above), please please please take a moment to complete the survey. Even if you didn't study abroad and don't plan to, I still want your input! It won't take more than 20 minutes to complete. If you can, please share this with other rural students and recent grads. The more responses I get, the better my dissertation will be. Here is the survey: ([url link] I promise that you won't be asked for any personally identifying information, not even an email address or name, so you don't have to worry about being spammed or anything like that. Thank you so so much for your help!  Best wishes, KT <eos> \n",

My undergrad never had a strong sports program so I'm excited about the intense football games. Any grad students out there have any difficulty with securing season football tickets?

            "<bos> I've been accepted to both UW and UMD for CS. I'm hoping to receive a scholarship from UMD making it around 12K cheaper than UW. Having said that, I still like UW and am leaning towards it. So is UW worth that extra 12K for CS? How do the CS programs compare?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been diagnosed since high school and I see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, so idk what more I can do to improve my mental state. I've accepted it as permanent, and thankfully I've gotten to a point where suicidal thoughts aren't a regular thing (maybe my biggest accomplishment!). It still feels like a 6cr class in terms of wasting my damn time, but it's bearable I'm a junior CS major, but I don't really have a passion for it or any other STEM field, and it exhausts me. I used to be an engineering major, but that was too overwhelming. taking cs 354 rn, but I only just got a McBurney visa and I'm so far behind that I think I'll have to drop the course. Thing is, I'm only taking 12 credits rn, half of them are easy lit/humanities courses, and I don't have a job or any extracurriculars. i dont get how people here are able to take like 16cr of CS courses and stay afloat, it amazes me and w/ the comp sci field in general it seems like you have to put hella effort outside of class teaching yourself practical skills to have a chance at a good job. I have trouble enough just focusing on my required coursework!  I'm thinking of just minoring in CS and switching my major to something like communications. I've gotten As in all my courses for the digital communications cert so I know I'd do well in it, and I'd be able to finish the degree quicker because I could take more credits a semester, but it's also terrifying because it's *gasp* not STEM and the job prospects seem ghastly. Seeing an advisor this week, but if anyone has had experiences like this (or some tips on studying while depressed) I'd love your thoughts. thx <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey everyone, just a quick question. I was thinking of throwing this course into my plan for next semester which includes Human Geography 101 (Comm B), Philosophy 100, CS 240, and CS 354. I was just wondering if this class is relatively easy (it's only one credit so I'd assume so?) and worth taking. Seems like a good way to keep up on my programming skills and learn a new language, but I wouldn't want to stress myself out too much with an optional course.  So, is this class relatively easy? Will my course load be too much or should I be good?  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I used the scholarship portal to find a match for which scholarships I am eligible for.  And for some reason I received Gender and Women's Studies for Graduate Award.  1. Has anyone had this problem before? And the scholarship portal seems to always crash or has an error notification. 2. What scholarships am I supposed to actually be eligible for as an undergraduate of the college of the letter and sciences? 3. Aside from the school itself, do you guys know any other organizations that give out scholarships to International Students? Any help would great thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> How strict is the 3.0 GPA requirement for UW grad school? I suffered with major depressive disorder among during my undergrad and ended with a GPA of 2.88 (final two years, 2.75 overall). I did not have any insurance at the time so it went untreated. Should I bother applying or my application get immediately rejected? I am going for Economics, Industrial Organization.  I haven't taken the GRE yet but I am historically I am a good test taker. Recommendations, I have been out of school for two years and never really connected with my professors. I can ask two of my former supervisors (from retail work) and I know they would give me awesome recommendations. And still considering my third recommendations.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi I'm an international student enrolling who has just recently signed up the English as a second language placement test and I just tried the sample test from the link to my email. Just wanted to ask, are the questions meant to be that hard??? There were quite a fair chunk of literature related/general knowledge questions that honestly I'm not exposed to in my country. I doubt I can learn all of it in time for my placement test, so I was wondering, does it really matter how well I do for this test? Because it's really expensive and I don't want to have to retake it again. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you:DD <eos> \n",

            "<bos> During the snowstorm on Sunday, I was rear-ended while at a stop sign (on Henry, stopped at Gorham). The driver stopped and gave me insurance information, but it turned out to be an expired policy. There isn't a ton of damage, but there is some, and it will cost some money to repair it. I have some basic info (name, plate#, etc.), and my insurance company is tracking the driver down. If you happen to be said driver, or have a friend with a BMW who mentioned getting into a minor accident on Sunday, please msg me so we can get this resolved more quickly and easily. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone, I applied Early Action to UW-Madison... It is my absolute top choice and even though decisions are coming in 2 weeks, I am getting extremely nervous about my chances. Would be great if you guys could provide some feedback as to where I stand. Geography: Tennessee, Indian Male UW GPA: 3.4 (to make this even worse, I have been on a downward trend from 9-11 and I had a C for the year in 11th Math, but I brought it up to a B in semester 1 of senior year) W GPA: 4.07 Rigor: 5 HL courses, 1 SL course in IB Diploma Program (I have taken the most rigorous curriculum out of anyone in my school)  Rank: School does not provide as we have a class size of 95 ACT: 36 (english-36, reading-36, science-34, math-36) Essays: 9/10 (I put more time into the UW essays than any other and got them reviewed by 2 teachers and 2 counselors)  Recs: I submitted three: one from physics teacher (8/10), one from english teacher (8/10), one from college professor who was my research mentor (9/10) Interest: I visited UW-Madison in the summer (that's pretty incredible to drive all the way up there from Tennessee right???) and have kept in touch with an admissions counselor from there (emailing her on a monthly basis) EC's: -Research with a college professor for 11 weeks -Internship with IT firm -Attended Harvard Summer School -President of ACT/SAT preparation club with 60 members -President of Astronomy Club -School Ambassador -All the generic stuff like Model UN, debate, varsity soccer, debate, volunteering etc From what I know, only one other kid has applied to UW early, and his GPA is far higher than mine but everything else is on par  I applied for 1st choice Biomedical Engineering 2nd Choice Computer Science // I did not apply for financial aid. Thanks so much guys. I know it's strange for me to post a chance thread with only 2 weeks till decisions but this is my favorite school and I'm really banking on it.  <eos> \n",

I've been looking at the Computer Engineering degree requirements, and I was wondering how the [Communication Skills]([url link] requirement (scroll down the page) worked. The way I understand it, my 5 in AP Lang covers my Comm A gen ed requirement and gives me 3 [\"English composition electives\"]([url link] So these can't be counted as ENGL 100 for Communication Skills in the College of Engineering requirements? Is the CoE requiring one of four specific English classes just to keep people from using AP credit? Thanks for the info. Edit: PS, does Madison take PLTW credit? PoE totally matches up with INTEREGR 110 and it would be nice to get that out of the way. <eos> \n",

I have around 3 years experience and know a lot of languages including C, C++, Java, Python and more. I received a degree in computer science and a masters with a concentration in software development I was hoping to continue working as a tutor now that I moved here and thought UWMadison might be interested. I have worked one on one and in group tutoring settings. I am working full time so nights and weekends are when I am free. If you are interested please send me an email at darkmer at att.net or a Reddit message to discuss further. Thanks for read and good luck this semester. <eos> \n",

There are a few things I'd like to know before I choose one, though, as biking isn't so big a deal in my hometown and I'm kind of clueless as to finding one that would be reliable transportation for school. For example, does the type of bicycle (road, mountain, hybrid, etc.) matter? What price range should I be looking at? What kind of lock should I get? Any sort of bike advice/tips would be appreciated. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm going to SOAR this week and I'd like to have some idea of what I want to take before I meet with my advisor. I'm majoring in psychology, and I focus on genetics and neuroscience in relation to psychology, so I feel it'd be advantageous to get started on that asap. I passed out of Intro to Psychology thanks to AP credit, so I was thinking of taking the Research Methods because I need to have that completed to take many of the other classes I want to take. I also think this would be a good time to take Biology. I somehow got a 4 on AP Chemistry, but there must've been one heck of a curve on that because I do not think I'm \"well qualified\" in Chemistry at all. So I was thinking of taking a chemistry class, and I'm leaning towards the 103/104 sequence because I want to make sure I really have a solid understanding of chemistry. I'm not sure what else would be a good idea to take, and I don't want to overload my first semester, so maybe something more fun, or maybe I'll just leave it as is. I'm in Bradley so I'll be taking one of those 1 credit seminars, so maybe that'll be plenty for me. Does this sound like a good overall schedule? I'd appreciate any input, as picking out classes is a lot different for college than it was in high school. Thank you :) <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Going to school in Madison offers a few unique benefits, one being that you are just blocks away from your state rep's office. They are currently in session, and it might be a good idea to go pay them a visit... [If you do not know your state rep or sen, look them up here]([url link] then go in and basically tell them what you think about cuts to the UW system(Dems won't vote for it, just go talk to Republicans that represent you).  Telling them what you think, and telling them that you would not support their re-election if they vote for the budget with UW cuts is more effective than you might think, as they only have several thousand constituents (vs members of congress). Every person adds pressure, and makes think even if they vote for it anyway. Seriously the state is playing with fire, stand up for your future people. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> In my country, because we don't have 4 seasons, our school terms starts from January and ends at December, which is different from USA's Fall\\-Fall academic system. Thus, there's a half year gap for me between high school grad and college. My mind is already \"rotten\" and I need some practice to recall my math, not that I forgot, but def. not as good as my usual self. So for those who already taken the placement test, how hard is the math placement test? Is learning using SAT math sufficient? Do I have to memorize the \"USA measurement system?\"\\(We used metrics in my country\\) Thanks in advance <eos> \n",

            "<bos> only thee coolest instrument known to man. jocks admire tuba players. cheerleaders want to do tuba players. It originated back in the late 1790s when a man named corneilious tuba was picking up tons of hot babes in his hometown. He needed a cool club or something to separate him so everyone would know that he was the man. so saw a baritone in a local pawn shop and thought of how much of a pussy instrument it was, so he looked at the trombone. he decided that it too was a pussy instument. then he bought 17 trombones and 40 baritones and took them home. Mr. tuba then worked for 23 straight hours building thee most manly of manly instruments. When it was created he learned how to jam some sweet tunes and then went out to town to test the beast. As soon as he stepped out of his wagon the ladies flocked to him like the ones on the axe commercials. a young boy saw this and told his friends about it. the beast was from then on known as the tuba. to this day only the elite play this monsterosity and they still pick up all the hot babes. <eos> \n",

Or if it's better to take on madison campus or during the semester. I didn't take AP physics or 201. If any other engineering majors took it through stout I would love to hear your advice! Thank you! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, I'm a high school senior applying to UWMadison, and I would like to major in CS and maybe double major in math or physics.  So far, I have taken AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics (5 on both APs) and Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra. I got an A in both subjects, but only dual enrolled for Linear Algebra. Firstly, would I need to retake multivariable calculus? Would showing them my high school transcript be enough to prove I took the course? Secondly, what math courses would I take freshman year? From what I've seen most people take the discrete mathematics course (240). Are there freshmen who take ODE (519) second semester? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Here's the scoop. I'm a senior in a microbio lab class (2 credits) that I don't need to graduate anymore since I got accepted to a program that doesn't require I take a lab course. I would just drop it like my buddy did, but then I would be at 119 credits and couldn't graduate in May as I have applied to do. Are there any classes (preferably only 1 credit) that I can join at this point in the semester? I would like to do this before the first exam in this course (March 4th). <eos> \n",
            "<bos> The grade distribution is a really, really high average GPA. I've heard from everyone who takes this class that it's fun and *easy.* I don't know if I'm just an idiot, but it seems pretty difficult. Lot of material, lot of names I've never heard of and it's easy to get it mixed up (at least with the older stuff). And my discussion is all people with music backgrounds who can actually analyze the music, which I most definitely cannot.  Am I worrying over nothing? This class should be easy but I'm just not seeing it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I signed the contract for an academic year for a room in a residential hall. However, my parent is experiencing sudden financial difficulties, I sent over all the financial documents, employment letter and letters from my family as a plea to request a release. What they have got back to me was like a systematic reply that they just don't release contract for on campus students. It feels like even I could not manage to pay for it and even I could only miss the payments. I feel very frustrated and helpless.  <eos> \n",

I have taken other CS classes at my previous community college and have self taught. I would have I am intermediate with both Java and Python.

            "<bos>  Just a friendly reminder that football season tickets for grad students go on sale tomorrow. They hold 1,500 tickets for grad students to buy every year. I'm not sure if they sell out or not, but they don't sell nearly as fast as the undergrad sale. If you are an undergrad and didn't get football tickets and you know a grad student who isn't interested in getting tickets for themselves, then I would buddy up with them and maybe kick a few bucks their way to get you tickets. It's a virtual guarantee that they get tickets if they log in at all tomorrow morning. The grad student buying process is a lot less stressful. <eos> \n",

Is that something I'll notice phase out after freshmen year is over and I have my own people or is that sort of just the nature of a big 10 school?  <eos> \n",

It would be cool to have something like that to put on a resume.  I'd think if they exist, most would be in the medical area. But let me know! Also, what are some awesome, interesting random courses you've taken? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Wisconsin's Choice is starting to narrow down the field to pick which candidate they will endorse for governor. (Disclaimer: I'm on mobile)  [url link]  \"from April 16th-April 19th, the people will vote in Wisconsin’s Choice first elimination round, narrowing the field to nine candidates. This will be the first vote of three, as we narrow the candidates down until we select our people’s champ in July. In the time between each vote, we’ll continue going around the state, host forums, and provide further opportunity for Wisconsinites to push the candidates on our key issues\"  What's cool is they have collected videos from most of the candidates, including ones not considered front runners, so you can listen to them side by side. Take a listen and notice how many are just reading scripts into the camera instead of speaking from their hearts. Notice how deapan and robotic some of them sound.  Then I hope you'll notice how earnest Mike McCabe is and how committed he is to being an actual people's champion by refusing to take *any* large money donations, not just the simple proclamation about refusing NRA money.  And then if you're inspired by anyone of them, get involved! It's honestly so motivating and it feels really great to be able to do something for the state. And if you like Mike, pm me about how you can get involved with our local group!  I'm part of the Dane County leadership group for McCabe and am starting a new Students for McCabe group to focus on young people's priorities and getting Mike in front of as many students and young professionals as possible before the primary! Let me know if you want him to speak in front of any groups you're involved in even if you aren't sure who you're going to support yet! Mike's already done an AMA in r/Wisconsin and r/WisconsinPolitics so check that out as well and we'll see if we can get him to do another one soon.  TL;DR checkout [url link] to get to know the candidates for governor and consider volunteering for any that inspire you!

            "<bos> Hello, I’m a student here at UW-Madison. Due to my financial situation, I’m living out of a mini bus: [url link] However, I’m not sure how to handle parking during the year. Normally I’d purchase a pass from the UW system, but I suspect they would hassle me over parking the bus, even though it fits into a standard parking space, in their lot. So, that leaves me looking for private parking. I’m interested in an overground lot (as opposed to an indoor garage) since I rely on roof solar panels to generate the energy that refrigerates my food. Ideally, for this reason, I would also prefer if the space wasn’t nudged between two buildings. I’m willing to pay a reasonable amount for a parking space, and would prefer somewhere close-ish to campus, since I mostly walk. Alternatively, if there’s a free space curbside area that I likely wouldn’t get hassled in, that would also work. I mostly keep to myself/remain quiet, and I try not to move the bus unless I need to. I don’t leave trash laying around the car or anything like that. Do you guys have any ideas for a decent parking location to call “home” next year?  <eos> \n",

I know it may seem risky giving your shoes to people you don't know well, but we're willing to do whatever is necessary to show you this is legit. We also have a full refund policy if you aren't satisfied. The group member who does all the work has had many years of experience from shining his family's shoes as well as close friends shoes. As part of the project, ALL revenues go to the charity (ideas range from Dane County Humane Society to Porchlight). The prices are cheap -- some examples include: Running shoes (eg Nike and Puma) ranging from $3 to $5 depending on the material and dirtiness of the shoes and Boots (eg uggs) average $8. [Here]([url link] and [here]([url link] are example pictures. If you have any questions or want your shoes shined, please message me!! Thanks (and sorry for advertising on here xD) <eos> \n",

I simply cannot speak the language, and apparently I'm supposed to be able too. (I took college courses in high school to get up to this point, but my teacher didn't ever have us speak. She was supposed to). Anyway, I found a Volcanos and Human Civilization course that starts in mid-October, but I am in need of one more credit. Does anybody know of any courses, credit count doesn't matter, that either haven't started yet, or would be willing to accept me late? <eos> \n",

It's pretty visible from the Union Terrace and the Red Gym area, as well. The building looks fairly symmetrical and appears to have lots of windows. It almost looks like an old hospital or school. Anyways, I've always noticed it but have failed to find any information on it.   If any of you guys know what this building is, do tell! It has always creeped me out a bit (although I would certainly go check it out if it were either on the bus line or I had a car - I love taking photos of old buildings)! <eos> \n",

I found myself to be more productive/more healthy/and more happy. However ever since returning back to campus I feel more isolated from my friends as all they want to do is party and I don't want to be that guy anymore.

            "<bos> Hey badgers, incoming freshman here. I've been wondering if the school itself offers classes such as EMT Basic or Lifeguard Instructor that can be taken as electives for credit. I ask because those certifications are necessary in getting promoted at the summer job I've been working at the past couple of years, and wanted to see if I could knock them out under NROTC scholarship. If such a thing does not exist, I would also enjoy being pointed in the direction of a Red Cross or affiliated agency that provides EMT basic, LGI, and WSI certifications.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm planning on living alone next semester, as I won't know if I'm going for sure until July, and I have a cat that I'm bringing. I figured this would make finding a roommate harder, and I also have an entire apartment's worth of furniture that I'd like to still get use out of. But I know living alone will burn a hole in my wallet close to campus, so I've been looking off campus to find some cheaper rates.  If I chose an apartment in say, Fitchburg, how easy is it to get to campus? Are there places I could park that have a bus stop? Or are there places farther off campus that still have a bus going to campus? (Not limiting to just Fitchburg, just an example) I don't mind \"commuting\" if it means parking somewhere and taking a bus. I just need something reasonably priced (not 1200 for a studio) and a decent size for my cat. Googling really just brings up everything on campus and downtown. Maybe someone is currently living somewhere similar to what I'm looking for? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all! I am currently a freshman attending UConn and was wondering about my chances at gaining acceptance to UW-Madison as a transfer student for Fall 2016. I am from out of state, and had a 3.6 my first semester as an actuarial science major. I look to pursue actuarial science should I be accepted to UW-Madison. If I can't get into the School of Business then I'll do mathematics as my major and a minor in the School of Business. I did well in high school, taking a total of 10 AP's and getting a 4 or 5 on 9 of them. I ended high school with a 4.7 GPA on a 5.0 scale. My ACT score was a pretty solid, a 32, but I'm not sure how important that will be. After this semester I'll have 34 college credits completed, not including my APs. During high school I participated actively in 2 clubs, and also worked about 8 hours a week for all four years. During college I've been involved in 4 hours of extracurriculars per week, but no leadership positions unfortunately. I do have a single letter of recommendation from one of my professors to aid my application. I didn't apply to UW-Madison during freshman admissions, but I wish I had!! I submitted my application kinda late (2 days before the deadline) and I still haven't heard back. I see that other transfer students in past years have heard back earlier, so I'm scared that I might not get accepted. I really hope to attend UW-Madison this Fall 2016, but am just scared I won't get in because I submitted close to the deadline! What are my chances, you think? Also, what are some good housing choices which are available for transfers? <eos> \n",

I have heard about people going to house parties (which then I wouldn't require a fake), but also heard they are hard to find unless you have connections. So my main question is, do I really need a fake ID to be able to drink/party?  Also I am aware of people getting them taken away by bouncers if they have a bad one, so is there a specific state? Or good place to buy one if I do need a fake? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Alright so here's my situation. In high school I had no issues making friends. I'm from a smaller town in northeastern Wisconsin and I know of maybe two other people in my high school that are also going here. Not really friends with them though, so I've started from the ground up. I got one person that I mainly hang out with and he's pretty cool, but I've been looking to make more friends. I like my roommate and talk to him quite a bit, but we don't hang outside of the dorms beside a few exceptions. I also have joined a couple of clubs and talk to people in classes, and I've made a few friends that way, with one being the guy I usually hang with. Problem is almost all of my friends are near Dejope, which is a 25 minute walk or a decently long bus ride whenever we want to hang out. My floor at Witte is definitely social, but I went to sleep early the first night I moved in while apparently everyone in my dorm met and got to know each other. So I've been playing catch-up since the beginning, and I got a few people that I talk to on my floor but nothing like it was in high school. TL;DR If there's anybody who has been having issues meeting people or is just looking to make new friends, feel free to hmu. <eos> \n",

As a freshmen who plans to take CS/Pre-business, what courses are recommended to take(or required to)?   Thanks in advance.

I'm Centering around lake Michigan and am finding I have an extra two days before my Sunday Brewers vs. Dodgers game. I did a search of \"hippie friendly\" towns in WI, and came up with Madison as the best bet (college town + , on a lake ++) being that its not too far from Milwaukee. I searched for the crunchy folk mostly because I'm in search of lesser known 'laid back' places in our fair fruited plain. My Question is: Are their any \"Can't Miss\" state parks or places around Madison?  <eos> \n",

My professor never really specified what I could and could not use on the quiz and I don't want to cheat on it so idk. Do the online quizzes track your background activity or what.

            "<bos> I am planning on graduating in the spring and I kinda fucked around until junior year until I really figured out what it was I wanted to major in. That being said I have a fuck ton of extra credits I have no use for with my declared major and randomly the other day I looked into the criminal justice certificate and (with 0 interest of my own in ever pursuing it) I realize I am not far from getting it with one semester left. Just out of curiosity, is there a program or anything out there that you could essentially plug your DARS or transcript into and it could figure out what certificate you are close to getting. And if not... any CS majors interested in creating that ;)  TL;DR: is there a way I can figure out what certificates I am close to completing without looking into all certificate requirements / checking my own DARS?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am currently a junior in high school, so college is right around the corner, and I am seriously considering UW Madison. I am from Northern Wisconsin and have a cumulative GPA of 3.97, but I do still have a year and a half left of high school, so my GPA could change a bit with some harder AP/Honors classes I will be taking. I feel like my grades could get me into Madison, however, I don't have a lot of extra curricular activities under my belt. I haven't been involved in any high school sports, I was involved in Key Club my freshman year, and student council my sophomore year, but then I lost my junior year student council election, then got a part time job that took up most of my time outside of school, so I don't have a lot of time to join clubs. I also have done quite a bit of volunteering, mainly because I took a volunteers class where we volunteered in the community. By the time I will have graduated I will have taken 4 years of a foreign language. I guess my whole question is: How much do extra curricular activities affect your chances of getting into Madison? (Side note I have not taken the ACT yet, but will be doing so next month, but I'm expecting my best score to be a 27-30 or so.  <eos> \n",

If anyone has any advice on how to prepare, or some old syllabi, or leftover textbooks, I'd be eternally grateful! <eos> \n",

I've got one ticket (sorry, not two), and I'd really rather give it to someone (fo' FREE) that will be able to enjoy the game live. If you're interested, PM me and we can take it from there. LET'S GO RED! EDIT: /u/the-mp raised a good point. [Here's proof of where you will be sitting]([url link] EDIT 2: Update - thanks everyone for the interest. Someone snagged the ticket and will be witness to the beginning of UW's quest for the National Championship. Enjoy! <eos> \n",

Instead, it says this: You have successfully logged out or your session has expired due to inactivity. I tried logging out and back in to My UW, and I tried this in both Chrome and Firefox and the same thing happens.

Or do I have to wait to see if I'm allowed to enroll ? *Wait listed for LSC 560 - Scientific Writing.

I plan on studying computer science and wanted to know if Mac OS would be okay? I know some campuses prefer Mac over Windows or vice versa, but couldn't find any info about UW. So does anyone know if I'd be okay getting a Mac, or would I have to use virtual machines and such for unsupported software? <eos> \n",

But I don't know much about American Football System and would like to know more about it. Can somebody please explain what is Big 10 West and Big 10 east ?  And what happens if you win your league ? Are you promoted to some other league for next season(like English Football League Championship to EPL in England) or do you get to participate in some other competitions (like Champions League in Europe) ? Is there some kind of competition where all top teams from all states get to participate ?  Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am currently a senior in high school and have gotten admission to Madison.  My question is how much do senior class changes matter? I'm currently set to take Calc 3 via dual enrollment with Oshkosh for 2nd semester. Yet Madison doesn't accept the credit for it, so there isn't really a point in taking it to begin with.  I've emailed the Admissions office but they gave the generic response of not approving or denying schedule changes. But just leaving the ominous note of it MAY cause admission to be rescinded. Is there a good chance that this can cause my admission to be revoked if I do drop Calc 3? I'm not even currently taking it. It also seems foolish for a school to first tell somebody that they cannot receive credit for a class, but then also turn around and tell them they cannot drop it either. <eos> \n",

I have a 3.60 gpa, 26 ACT, one year of football, some volunteering in the past in freshmen year, in a lower income family, asian descent. I have one AP class total and 8 honors/advanced classes.

            "<bos> I'm so incredibly excited to be going to UW-Madison next year but I have a few questions! If you can answer any of them or give me any general advice, I'd appreciate it! 1. I'm planning on majoring in Comm Arts and I'm looking at the FIGs options and some of them sound very cool to me. Will taking a FIG put me off my \"path\" to my major? Would you recommend FIGs? I also will probably be only able to go to a later SOAR, so how does that factor in to class selection? Just any sort of clarification on the course selection process would be great and how to avoid getting screwed over by SOAR. 2. How big are the dorms in Sellery or Witte? I know they give dorm sizes, but does it feel small? 3. How does one go about buying season tickets for the football games? 4. Should I go random roommate or try to connect with someone using the new Roomsync thing? 5. Is there anything you wish you knew when you were coming in as a freshmen? Sorry to be that annoying freshmen with all the questions! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi I am a freshman looking to transfer to UW Madison for the Fall of sophomore year. I am also premed so I do spend a decent time studying and getting involved on campus. However, I am a very social person and I would like to live somewhere where I could meet lots of students. I heard that Ogg is a good place to live as a transfer student, and I also wanted to know how the university apartments are and overall what the best housing option is for a sophomore transfer student. In addition, I am considering rushing as a sophomore and would like to know if anyone has had experience with this/if they would recommend it. Thanks, and I would appreciate any other general advise for new UW Madison students! <eos> \n",

I even have a short red headed Irish roommate that would play the part of a Leprechaun in my video! What are the chances?? Anyways I would need the costume for less than a day. The filming should take less than an hour. I could give you some collateral as well. I can pick it up and drop it off. I would love to get this done, but unfortunately my roommate doesn't come equipped with a Leprechaun costume! Let me know! Here is my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/edahl85 <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So, I royally fucked up. Thought I passed German in high school, and even passed a college German course in high school, I am doing terribly in my current German class. The real problem is that, though I can completely understand everything my teacher says in German, I can't speak the language myself. I know the words when they are spoken to me, but I can't come up with them on my own when asked a question. So, what happens if I fail?  Note: I'm not sure if it matters, but I will still meet my credit requirements if I don't receive the credit for this course. <eos> \n",

I just transferred here this year and the co-ops at my old university were entirely made up of students.

At the moment i am trying to choose resident halls but I have limited knowledge on them so i would like some help. Just some info: I am in my 3rd year of university so i think that means I'm a 'junior' at college. I am studying Kinesiology so most of my classes will be at the Natatorium. Based on this info, it seems Dejope and Phillips are the best pick for me. Can anyone give me some of their experiences at these halls? edit: So I've had a look at the info on each hall and the conclusion I've made is that in Phillips has its own bathroom but Dejope has more people to socialise with. Still would like to hear some personal experiences. <eos> \n",

Given my previous coursework, I haven't had to write a paper since first semester of freshman year.  I kinda miss being graded on papers as opposed to exams, so I was wondering if anyone had taken any of the following Econ courses (all options for next semester) and knew if they were graded, at least in part, on papers/essays.

My last semester before winter break I earned less than a 2.0 (still passed all my classes that semester), however, because I had a previous semester with &lt; 2.0, I was informed via e-mail of my suspension. My first three semesters here I had a 4.0, but it just spiraled down after that. I blame stress. Stressed out about saving up for student loans, paying rent and bills. I was working 80+ hours a week WHILE going to school and I think that is what caused me to do so badly. The e-mail also mentioned an appeal process, but I'm not sure what I should do to convince the committee to let me back in? Any help? Also. Since I have above a 3.0 GPA and more than 75% of my credits passed (all of them passed, actually), would this suspension affect my financial aid? <eos> \n",

I personally think that \"fuck you, eat shit\" is pretty unoriginal and not worth our time. However, the other things that we yell about the game I feel are just part of the atmosphere of college football. \"You Fucked Up\" and \"Shoot 'em Like a Horse\" might not be the most classy things to chant, but they help to make Camp Randall one of the most intimidating stages in college football. <eos> \n",

My problem is that while online gaming I have already noticed that my internet connection seems to drop packets and DC for 5 seconds at a time every few minutes. Was wondering if I was doing something wrong, the dorm internet is just like that, or if I should talk to DoIT. Thanks Edit: They responded to my ticket and said due to the high amount of students registering for UW-Net that it may be slower or disconnect me. I doubt this is what is causing the issue knowing IDK how many new students are registering their devices at 11pm, but they said to send a message if its still happening on friday... <eos> \n",

Now I'm on my way to Madison. I know I'm admitted to the college of engineering, but I'm undecided as far as a major goes. I probably won't end up doing anything with engineering.

I am now having second thought about taking it. Has anyone ever taken the class online? Or just taken it in general? How difficult did you think it was? Exam-wise and time-wise? Mainly, I'm just trying to figure out how much time I would have to dedicate to it because I have a couple of other things going on this summer. I'm working and also taking EMT classes. Do you think it would be possible to also take this class online? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My fiance and I had a little incident on Saturday when we tried to get into Camp Randall. The misses tried to bring in her nice DSLR camera with a somewhat large lens into the stadium to take pictures of the Marching Band as she is an ex-member/has friends who wanted some nice photos taken of them. One of our friends who is still in the band was in the pregame show but not the half time show so we wanted to get pictures of him during pregame. We left Union South after the little pregame concert and when we reached the gate we were turned away by the event staff after my fiance's camera was deemed a \"professional camera\". Now before you ask yourself what is a \"professional camera\", I assume they meant a camera with a detachable lens which up until two(?) seasons ago was a prohibited item. Now if you go onto their site found [here]([url link] detachable lenses are indeed an acceptable item. After arguing with the guy at the gate for a couple of seconds we went over our options. Luckily it popped into my mind to go look for event services, which after some time (we ended up missing the pregame show) the staff at the event services desk did eventually say my finances camera was acceptable and we were let in after going through the media check in. Now here is my question, when I asked what their official policy I didn't get a clear answer instead the nice lady helping us said \"it is up to our staff to determine whether or not an item is prohibited\". I understand that is one of those generic responses, but doesn't answer my question. Anyone have any better idea on what the official policy is about cameras? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> It's early, but I'd like to get a head start on thinking about my classes this upcoming semester. I'm an undecided major as well, thinking about majoring in either computer science or a life science like microbiology. My spring course load is looking like this: Math 217 (5 credits) Chemistry 103 (4 credits) Computer Science 367 (3 credits) I think this may already be enough credits as it is, but I was wondering if there were any easy humanities/social science classes I could knock out of the way. Otherwise, I was thinking about taking CS 252, if anyone has any feedback on how difficult it was or the amount of work required for the class. I'm currently taking 17 credits now and it's a lot of work, so I'd rather take it easy my spring semester. With regards to CS 252, I've heard the professors teaching it this spring aren't very good. Would it be worth my time to wait and take the course next fall? <eos> \n",

[url link] He and his wife were seated in First Class as I was boarding the plane and I waved and said, 'Hi coach! On Wisconsin!' He was incredibly polite, and since there were still a ton of people in front of me started a conversation with me asking about my studies and then wishing me safe travels and best of luck for the rest of the semester.

Is it unmanageable given how much I have going on? <eos> \n",

I've read on the housing website that the first day I can apply for a switch is the first day of classes, which I'm fine with, but I'm wondering what are the actual chances of me being switched, and how soon? I'll be applying for this switch by myself, so I won't be dragging a roommate with me, which I understand would make things more difficult.  If any of this info helps, I was assigned to Kronshage and I'm looking to get into either Liz Waters, Witte, or Sellery. Also, before anyone asks, I'm not completely keeping Kronshage out of the picture. Of course I'm gonna try it out and see how I like it in the first week.  <eos> \n",

What are some opinions on a schedule like this? If I had to take out ECE 210, ECE 252 which would you recommend.

I don't know how intensive ECE 252 is but I heard CS 367 is pretty tough so I'm worried about taking it with math and physics. <eos> \n",

If so, what materials did you need or use (i.e. textbook)? If there was any textbook used, can someone let me know if I can borrow it for the semester so that I don't have to pay $100 this semester? If not, do any of you know of any discounts or places to buy a cheaper version of this book? Lastly, how did she teach (from the book or made up lecture)? How were the readings, like were they too long and understandable? How were the quizzes, homework and exams like in this class? How did you prepare for them? Were the exams and quizzes difficult?

            "<bos> So I just bombed a midterm and decided to do some digging on the class. Found out that I only took half the prerequisites for the class. The thing is, the official enrollment page where you enroll in classes said that the one half of the prereqs were actually the only prereq. Not sure if it's that big of a deal, but has this happened to anyone else before? I'm thinking of dropping the class now (since I failed the midterm anyways) and take it again after I get my other prerequisite class done. Would this be the best course of action? Thanks! <eos> \n",

Where do you think is a good dorm for transfers to live? NOT the transfer house please, I don't really like how private the location of it is. Also, as far as dorms go... are there any that are in between a party dorm and a super quiet one? I don't want to be living with \"boring\" people but also don't want to live where it's crazy.

I've combed through this subreddit and College Confidential hundreds of times to try and find answers and I guess a sense of clarity, but I still continue to lose sleep thinking about what my future holds. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but also realistic that Madison may not be where I'm headed this fall.  I am an in-state applicant with no legacy. I have roughly a 3.6 UW GPA with a 28 ACT (10 writing) and a good amount of ECs. I just sent in my 7th semester grades (3.75 UW GPA) that continue my upward trend. Additionally, I sent the admissions department an e-mail reiterating my desire to attend UW and that I would definitely enroll if I was granted admission.  However, I read that this was a record breaking year for the number of applications sent to UW and I worry that will lessen my chances even more of getting in, especially out of the postponed pool. Anyone have any take on the situation or was in this same spot and have some words of wisdom/reason for me?  Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

Now the problem is that it appears to be next to impossible to find any king of housing for the fall semester, which really sucks and can be a problem for my visa interview. If I don't have a place to stay, they might reject my visa. As a last resort I'm looking a hostels (don't know which ones are good/cheap), but I don't want that to be my permanent solution.

So I'm looking for a room from mid august(or a little bit earlyer I don't mind) until Mid/end January(fall semester). I would love to have a room near campus around langdon/state street but I won't complain if It's a little bit further from campus. My price range is up to around 550$ I'm a student from Utrecht university in The Netherlands and I will be 22 when I arrive in Madison. I like going out but I'm pretty serious about my study as well. Last but not least I get along with almost anybody! So if you're still looking for a roommate in the fall semester, look no further and contact me! gr, ondiepe <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently a freshman with 22 credits (from AP classes) so my registration time is on the 26th at 3:15 (meaning earlier than most freshmen). I'm currently an engineering major and I'm taking math 222, which makes it kind of vital that I take math 234 next semester. However, from looking at the \"schedule planner\" on the student center, there are only 3 more sections and a total of 27 seats left in those sections and all the rest are filled up. Also, I know there are people registering earlier on monday than me so chances are all of those will be filled as well. Will they be opening new sections up for freshmen? Or will I have to just not take 234 until next year when I have a higher standing? TL;DR: Do more sections of popular classes like calc 3 (math 234) open up as the other sections get filled, or are freshmen just screwed out of getting any classes? <eos> \n",

I've got one more semester left, and the last thing I want to do is take a difficult/busy class that I won't care anything about- I've already got four difficult ones lined up. Thanks!

            "<bos> I'm having trouble getting many classes to fit into my schedule for the fall, so I'm considering taking an english class that's required for my major on top of another Comm B class that's in my major. The english class is English 201. The class in my major is Chem 346. Has anyone taken either of these classes? (Especially 346, I'm really curious what that class is going to be like). Is the workload for either class huge? My english 100 class only required us to write two essays (about three pages each) because my teacher was super easy on us. I don't think 201 will be that way. I'm not exactly a great writer/reader either, which is why I'm hesitant to take both of these in the same semester. I'd really appreciate any opinions though! Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just received permission to enroll for comp sci 252 intro to computer engineering . Thing is, apparently the lecturer, Adil is REALLY bad  After talking to several people who are currently taking his class, many of them do not encourage me to take it and instead wait for the following semesters. Reading his reviews on ratemyprofessor discourages me even more.  I would like to hear some thoughts from people who have taken this course before, especially from this lecturer. Is it possible to get an A in this course from a lot of self studying even if the lecturer is not good ?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey everyone! I am a freshman this year at UW-Madison, and this year has been really stressful for me. I am in some pretty hard classes this semester  am struggling quite a bit in a couple  am really burnt out already. I have to make it through this semester, but am quickly losing interest in my current major (Engineering). I am not sure what I want to major in anymore, so I am looking to knock off some Gen-Eds next semester. What classes have people really enjoyed here? I am willing to work hard but I need a fresh start next semester with some different types of classes. Thanks!  Note: Most lacking areas are biological sciences  social sciences (I have not taken any classes in these subject areas). But open to suggestions for all classes!!  <eos> \n",

I just want to know everything about my major before I reach campus. I was wondering what the average starting salary for a CS major was? The official site gives no information and all other sources were contradicting each other, so I thought I'd be better off asking the students here. I also got accepted into Purdue, and they say the average starting salary for CS graduates there is ~$76,000 per year. Is the salary for UW-Madison also about the same? Also, I would appreciate it quite a lot if I could talk to one of you about Wisconsin-Madison. I just have a few questions which I really don't see making other posts about (this topic is quite important to me, so I made it). Thanks so much, guys! <eos> \n",

Does Wisconsin have a good program for integrating transfers into the campus life, and does anyone that has transferred here have any advice for me?

            "<bos> I really want to go here, and I'm undecided. I have average grades for here, and very little extracurriculars. Do I have better chances applying as undecided, or choosing a major that I may not want but I'm interested in? My thoughts for a major I would choose just to apply as would be something like Actuarial Science (in Business school), Computer Science or something in Letters and Sciences. If it's better to have a major selected, which of these schools would be easiest to initially get into? I've heard CS is a harder to get into. <eos> \n",

My main question is what is the average GPA for MechE over here? I looked through the website and they didn't give any specific details. My GPA is 3.822, I completed 45 credits most are calculus, physics, chem, CompS, and engineering statics. I have 2 B's in calc 1 and statics. Do I have a really good shot, or is it a slim chance.

I searched through the student organizations online but they all seemed old or just had a few people in the \"roster\". I myself play a lot of piano and guitar, and would like to find someone to jam with! I enjoy virtually all genres.

            "<bos> It seems like every single post in this sub asking for help (e.g. choosing courses) gets downvoted. I think this sub is an invaluable resource of peers that should be open to helping out with all aspects of the college/Badger experience, especially one as central as class choices. I know some questions have already been answered and can be found via search, but I don't think that means we should discourage everybody that's looking for that kind of help.  <eos> \n",

They've put me into individual counseling which I have been going to for a few weeks now but I don't really understand what the point of it is. It's literally just sitting in a room with a grad student intern that listens to you talk and then says something like \"woowww, hearing that makes me feel *grief!\"* Like how is that helpful to anyone? It's definitely not helping me at all and I'm not sure what else to do as that seems to be all UHS has planned to help me with my issues and I don't know who else to turn to.  Has anyone else on here been through/had this experience with UHS and what did you do? Are there other services available? <eos> \n",

If it entails a lot of work besides showing up to class I don't think I'm interested as my schedule is packed. It's only once a week but that still cuts into time in between classes and relaxation time. Is it a 'fun' class where you meet up with Chad residents and chill or is it a liberal arts nonsense class where you over analyze literature? The deadline to drop is ~ Sep 14 so I can always go to the first week's class and drop, but I would like to hear some people's experiences with it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, I posted here a little while ago asking about essays, back again. So the deadline is approaching for materials to get in (March 8). My transcript requests should be processed and the transcripts sent by then, but I'm kind of tearing my hair out over the recommendation letter. I had, incredibly stupidly, forgot that it was required as opposed to recommended, and so just reached out to a professor Friday. The problem is, they declined since I didn't really speak much in their class, and didn't feel like they could've written a good recommendation. They were really the only professor that could've spoken to my academic ability, since a number of my classes are lectures and I really haven't formed any good enough relationships with any professors who could write one. Anyone have any suggestions or advice? The letter is required and I can think of absolutely no professor who could write this letter for me. I asked a former coach to write one just as a supplementary recommendation but aside from that I've got absolutely no one. Sorry for the wall of text, typed this off my phone <eos> \n",

At the same time I realize that certain classes are more difficult than their number of credits might suggest. I'm just looking for a second opinion about this trio of classes. If it helps to know, I'm also taking ECE 210 (lab). If any of you guys have taken one or more of these classes and could describe the workload and exams it would mean a lot. <eos> \n",

I was wondering if it would be reasonable to do a straight major in biology, or if I should do a more \"in depth\" approach such as genetics, biochem, etc. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

It'd probably be best to stay in one of the more 'social' dorms since i won't know anyone in madison, but i'm not too sure if i'm able to stay in Sellery/Witte since it's a freshman dorm? I'm 19 so I'm in my second year of uni here in Australia (a sophomore in your terms?) so any advice would be appreciated.  Also a question about weather, what's the weather like from August to December since it doesn't get *that* cold here. If anyone has tips what to bring for the cold weather please lmk  Finally, I'm majoring in history so if anyone has any recommendations for classes it'd be greatly appreciated!  <eos> \n",

I read that only around 8% of students at UW-Madison are in the honors college and I'm not sure if I'm ready for it.  I took almost all honors and AP classes in high school (7 AP classes, rest honors except US history), but I'm sure that so have most of the other people who have been accepted.  How much harder is the honors college and is it worth the effort? Can I apply my sophomore year after I get a feel for the whole college experience? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I plan to pursue a CS major and I've been looking at some classes I want to start taking already. Some of them require prerequisites but I heard that prereqs aren't enforced for CS.  Is this still true or did they start enforcing them? I was looking at 352 but 252 is a prereq. Could I still enroll without taking 252? My position is kind of tricky because I haven't satisfied quantitative reasoning A, so I can't enroll for any CS courses until around August (when I get that credit). I assume because I haven't satisfied QR A, a prerequisite, other requisites will also be enforced? Or is it just because QR A is a general requirement?  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

My biggest problem is that I have only ever been on a bike a few times, and would really like to have someone teach me a lot of the basics.  I was supposed to have an uncle and my dad show me, but due to health reasons and family commitments, those are no longer an option. I already have my M class learners permit, and I plan on taking a course this summer, but I really want to be comfortable and be able to pass the test before I take the course.

I know nothing about Java and OOP. I decide to learn by myself. Any advice is welcome! Please list some materials and essential tasks covering the topics on CS302! Appreciate it! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Looking for some advice as to whether or not I should take MHR 300 online. As a business student, I have to take it, and am hoping to make the experience as pleasant as possible since I've heard such shitty things about the class? So what are your opinions? Is it better/easier to take this online, or should I just suck it up and take the regular lecture class? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello all. I am a currently a senior in HS, and I really want to get into the UW-Madison CS program. Is anyone in or know someone in the program? If so, what are their HS credentials? GPA, Rank, Test scores, etc. I want a really vague idea of what it will take. Thank you. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I feel like I should start doing this soon. It may be too late for the spring semester, but I'm hoping to work in a lab over the summer, and then continue next school year (my sophomore year). I don't have a GPA yet, so I was thinking maybe I should wait until my grades come out. I just don't want to make any freshman mistakes or things like that, and ruin my chances of getting into a lab. All the applications seem fairly straightforward, and I have some professors I could ask if I need recommendations. I'd just appreciate advice from people who've applied to labs and/or work in one now. Thanks! And sorry if this didn't make much sense, I've been studying for a long time and I'm at that point where things are ceasing to make logical sense :/ <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm really into fitness (weightlifting / running) and nutrition (dieting) and would love to take some classes into these areas for fun (I'm a CS major). Has anyone taken any classes in these areas for fun? I was thinking maybe Nutri Sci 132 (although I'm not sure, this class seems to focus less on actual nutrition and more on global trends or something) or Kinesiology 100. Any class recommendations for someone like me?   <eos> \n",

Is it good for meeting people and getting adjusted, especially as an out of state. It is worth noting I'd be on the pre business track (unfortunately not direct admit) so would living in lakeshore be an utter pain in the ass? Thanks for any info you can share :D <eos> \n",

Rent is $515 per month and we live on Vilas in a 4 bedroom/1 bathroom house. We're pretty close to campus and also close to two bus stops. We have free laundry, a dishwasher, a big backyard and utilities are usually under $30 each per month. Also, we have a beautiful princess of a cat and are all extremely trees-friendly.  Message me if you'd like more details. You could stay just the fall semester or the whole year if you like! <eos> \n",

I’m an out of state student and was looking at ways I could potentially save some money, and looking at my four year plan, I’ll have all of my core classes for my degree done before my last semester but will just need a few more credits to graduate. Is it possible for me to do my last semester at my community college and transfer them in to graduate, or does the last semester have to be here? <eos> \n",

Could really use suggestions on placed to park, anywhere like apartment building lots or parking passes for lots, behind houses, parking ramps, etc. Even streets that don't ticket you after 2 hours. Could be anywhere on campus but less than $80 is my budget.  <eos> \n",

I know I can get into the school, I just don't know about my chances for the school of music. I'm a great musician but there always seems to be people better than me... Are there high standards to get passed the audition? I'd probably try out on piano (and go into music education maybe?) which makes me skittle nervous because I think you have to memorize your piano pieces and I seem to get more nervous when playing piano in front of others for some reason. I just want to know how difficult the audition is, how hard it is to get in, what they're lookingfor in the audition, and just general tips. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

It'd be a way to remotely search for housing and see what kind of place they're moving to. Unfortunately, the company I work for can't fund a trip to Madison and online articles only tell you so much. I wanted to hear which neighborhoods in Madison are great and why from students/locals, so I can represent the city as accurately as possible. Been browsing through existing threads on this sub, but I wanted to ask about neighborhoods in more detail.  If you do mention a neighborhood, giving me a feel for the neighborhood's vibe would be great. This means answers to questions like: Is it a student ghetto with lots of pizza shops and low-end bars? Is it an upscale neighborhood with lots of high-end restaurants? Is the area known for great shopping? Is the neighborhood known as indie arts center with co-ops and avant-garde art galleries? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.  <eos> \n",

I'd just like to hear some feedback from other students who have taken this course. Was this course an easy A? How hard was the final project? Was it easy to manage the final project during finals week? What professors should I stay away from? Any helpful answers, tips, comments about this course would be greatly appreciated!

            "<bos> I'm a BDes student in New Zealand and really want to do an exchange to the states next year and UW-Madison is pretty much the best looking choice to me at the moment. I'm a graphic design major so I'm mostly looking at doing art/design courses and maybe some art history. If anyone here takes classes in either area I'd be interested to hear what the workload is like because I understand things are generally different outside the US; for example at my college I only have 2 50% assignments for each class. I've spent a couple of weeks in Chicago but other than that I have no idea what the U.S is really like. Currently most concerned about finding somewhere to live since I need something furnished, doing some research it seems like I'd be looking to spend about $600 a month? Is it easier to find places in Fall and how likely is it to get a semester long sublet?  Also interested in anything you can tell me about Madison in general, what is there to do for fun when you're 19/20 etc etc  edit: extra word in title fail  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm a Junior transferring to UW this Fall and I'm looking to find an efficiency or studio apartment in the next month or so. Although I'm from WI, I haven't been in Madison in a while, and I'm currently living out of state so I can't physically check any places out until late July/August. I found a few sites that list efficiencies and studios, but I thought some of you guys here might have some suggestions. I'm looking for something small, and either within biking range or near a bus line. Ideally it's somewhat quiet - not exactly the partying type. Also, if you have any tips for a first time renter in the Madison area, feel free to share! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So for anyone that isn't aware, CS 367 data structures has a new setup this semester, where everything is based off of teams. All of your programs you must write in your team of 6, (and of course this leads to differential effort and levels of understanding in the group), and for the quizzes, only 2 randomly chosen people in the group have to take the quiz, and the grade for everyone in the group is based off of the average of the two. Also, team participation is worth 10% of your overall grade.  Personally, I feel like this is detrimental to my learning, and dealing with shitty group members is much more frustrating than trying to learn the material by myself. Also, being entirely reliant on others for my grade on the quiz is very frustrating as well. I was just wondering if any of you are also in the class this semester, and what you may think of it? <eos> \n",

One of my concerns is finding a roommate for my apartment. Am I able to sign the lease for my apartment, and then find a roommate, or must I sign a lease for my apartment with my roommate there?

I am curious about any types of scholarships I might be able to recieve. In addition, I was told recently that there may be scholarships for autistic students. Though I am not technically diagnosed of it (yet), my parents and I are pretty convinced that I have some type of Austism Spectrum Disorder. I did recently spend some time with a neuropsychologist for this reason, so I should be getting a diagnosis in the next few weeks. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

So, as I said, I'm graduating in December. I've already applied for graduation. I know that every other year when I accept financial aid, whatever I accept is split between fall term and spring term. Obviously, I won't be here for spring term. So, let's hypothetically say I want $2,000 for this fall. Should I accept $2,000, or $4,000? The grants I received are only for the fall semester...so I'm thinking it's likely I just take $2,000 if that's how much I need. But, I would be in a pretty tight financial situation if I'm wrong and only get half of what I accept. Any help appreciated! Thanks! <eos> \n",

I am currently planning on majoring in Political Science and minoring in either History, sociology, religious studies, or something else of that genre. I am currently living near Chicago, so madison is fairly close. I also like how UW is cheaper than most other schools of it's caliber. My one reservation is the party scene that UW supposedly has. I don't drink, smoke weed, etc. Is it possible to avoid the party scene or is it just embedded in the school's social life? Thanks for listening! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello! I am currently a Freshman at another 4 year college majoring in Psychology and I would like to know some tips on what I would need in order transfer to UW-Madison as a Sophomore. I know that according to their Transfer Admission site, you need to have at least 24 transferable credits. But I also hear that you need a relatively high GPA in order to be considered. My stats as of Fall 2016 is a GPA is 3.7 with 17 credits, and in the Spring 2017 Semester, another 15 Credits will be completed. With a total of 32 transferable credits I already pass the 24 credit mark. But other than the credits, what else do they look for? The site was not very specific, but I'm worried because I barely have any extracurriculars. So I guess my main question is, do they look at college extracurriculars and high GPAs too?  <eos> \n",

The more people sign up under a schools name the more space everyone at that school has. UW is close to 8GB.

My life didn't get any better so I'm moving back with my dad this summer. Unfortunately, I've been a Californian resident for a year but if I move back, I'll be able to live in Wisconsin for a year before I start college.

Well now the time is ticking down and I have a terrible sense of direction so does anyone know of a tour I can sneak in if my friend can't show me?

            "<bos> So...one of my facebook friends has been ranting about this article he/she found today. It's about a fairly gruesome study going on in UW-Madison about housecats that supposedly involves all sorts of horrible things like invasive brain surgery while the animal is awake, injection of toxic substance to deafen the animal, i.e., blatant animal cruelty. [url link] Well, I waded through the expected shocking nature of this article and was frustrated to find no real evidence outside of their website as to what is actually going on in this lab. They keep quoting the \"experimenters\" (notice, they don't refer to them as scientists, heh) without any hard reference to an interview. Also, things like, \"Their records show...,\" with no reference to that, either (besides maybe a link to another page in their website). They could be completely manipulating what was said in the interview or records, right? Well, anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this; maybe personally, or maybe just word-of-mouth. Or, if not, what do you think about the article in context of your experience at the University, or your field, etc.? I want to know if I should question the legislation of ethics employed here at UW-Madison, or if it's just PETA manipulating images to hit me in the feels. Whatever happened to \"Double Trouble\" has to be something pretty awful - I feel kind of sick thinking about if everything this article states is true. But, I have a hard time believing that blatant animal cruelty is at work behind our scientific community. Thoughts? Edit: I'm not sure why I'm getting downvotes here. I was kind of opening up discussion to something that possibly might be relevant (it's actually exactly relevant) to UW-Madison. Not trying to say it's a valid article or anything - I mean it's PETA, lol. But I didn't want to have to come out and say it like that. If you disagree with something about the subject of the post, perhaps discuss it, rather than downvoting it so nobody else will see this!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I went to wendt commons (4th floor) today to do some work. I got there at like 10:50. When I got there, I looked at the board, and it said only talbes 1-7 (or something) were reserved from 11:00-12:15. I sat at a table that was not one that the board said was reserved (the table itself had a sign that said it was open, whereas some tables had little \"reserved\" signs on them). At 1:10 a guy (the instructor?) came and said that the table was reserved (and was pretty mean about it). I got up and left.  I really liked studying at Wendt, but this has sort of soured me on the experience. Is there a way that I'm supposed to know what tables are to be reserved when? I thought that I was in the clear because the board (when I walked in at least) didn't say that the table that I was at was reserved, and the table I was at didn't have one of the reserved flags.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> For those who take CS577 this semester, how well do you do in class right now? Like how much did you get on your hw. As for me, I feel like I did not do well at all on homework and stuff. Checking the hw solutions that was posted, I feel like there is no way for me to write a detail proof like that. Maybe I'm too dumb for this stuff. So, if you are doing well in this class, can you share some tips or resource that can help me get better in this class. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> They're living in Campus Village Apartments: 9A Gerry Court, just minutes from campus.  It's a two bedroom apt and the girls already living there are sharing a bedroom so any other potential tenant would have a room to themselves.  Total rent is $1330/month so the rent for the one room would be $448/month.  Let me know if you guys are interested. More information can be provided upon request.   If you have any advice to help them out, that would also be greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hiya, So, I committed to UW last week and signed up for SOAR. After I didn't receive the housing invite, I emailed undergraduate housing services and they said that they couldn't offer me housing and would put me on the wait list for it. I'm out of state (but moving in from Europe) and am confused as to what my next steps should be. Should I look into off campus housing? If so, where? Any guidance is appreciated. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I applied to Madison about a month and half ago. Upon reviewing my application a couple weeks ago out of nervousness, I noticed that in one of my essays, I typed a different college's name instead of UW Madison once. The sentence was something like \"The program at (college that isn't Madison) is nationally renowned for being one of the best.\" I absolutely intended to say Madison, but I was in the process of applying to the other college and my brain just got mixed up. Other than that stupid typo, I don't think there's any other reason for UWM to reject me. I got a 34 on my ACT, have various extra-curriculars, and have an almost perfect GPA (unweighted). I'm seriously freaking out that I'm going to be rejected based on my careless mistake, and that would absolutely kill me because Madison is really the only school that I fell in love with.  Any advice? Should I email the school explaining my carelessness, or should I just let it go and hope they ignore it?  Thank you!  <eos> \n",

This is my first year at UW Madison and I was hoping to get tips from people who have had experience with the parking at UW. Any input is appreciated! Thanks!  Edit:I am coming from Waunakee. I am looking into parking and riding the bus and/or getting a parking space downtown and biking or taking a bus from there...  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, just looking for some advice on how to get involved with the track team and whether or not I should. I ran track throughout high school, it was my main sport and now that it's in season again I'm starting to really miss it! I sort of screwed myself out of going to state last year (I'm a freshman) by choosing to run the individual 800m instead of the 400m. Turned out the other 800m runners were beyond me but with the split I ran in my 4x4 at sectionals, I would have gone to state in the individual. My 4x4 split was a 50.3 but I'm confident I could have run below 50 if I had gone to state. If I were to join the team I would think I'd run the 400m. My 800m PR was 2:03, so it wasn't bad but I don't think it's good enough to run at Madison. My questions are these: Are my times fast enough to earn a place on the team? What should I do to go about joining the team? How difficult is it to balance school and practice/meets? If you can think of anything else I should know then feel free to tell me that as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!                                          Edit: Looks like a common theme here is the Track Club! Almost joined it at the beginning of the year but I ultimately decided against it because I was working a lot. I'll definitely give it another look, but it'll have to wait until after my last midterm because I should really be studying right now.  Thanks for the replies, good luck with the rest of the semester and may it stop fucking snowing! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This might be a stupid question but are any campus parking lots relatively close to campus open for free parking on football game days? I’m gonna drive to Madison for the homecoming game on Friday (10/19) and probably just leave my car there until Sunday. If not will I need to find street parking? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I don't want to sound like an idiot, but I've seen a lot of advice where at least a portion of it says \"keep your door open.\" What does this do? Like will people just walk into your room and hang out? Can you just walk into someone's room with the door open and be like hey what's up I'm ____?  Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I figured it'd be worth an ask. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I'm interested in studying the chemistry and effects of air pollution and how it influences our environment. However, I've been told Environmental Science at UW focuses more on Ecology. I've looked at courses I could take that would cover what I'm interested in and CALS requirements such as POP HLTH 502, CIV ENGR 423 and ATM OCN 323, but I'm worried this may be the wrong major. However, I have covered more pre-reqs for Environmental Science than Atmospheric sciences, so if I were to switch I'd be there for an extra semester and risk losing credits. Doss anyone know if Environmental Science would cover what I'm interested in or would it be worth switching? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> How can I get a high school summer internship? I've applied and contacted to other universities that have high school internships, but Madison has been my dream school since forever. I've been looking around for professors to contact, but couldn't find good information. Should I contact the vice chancellor of biological sciences since I'm interested in a biomed internship? If anyone has work with great professors in the biomed field please pm me. BTW I'm a high school junior.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm a 21-year-old junior from Denmark, and I'm going to study at the College of Engineering during this fall semester. I have a binding contract to the dorms, but I'm clueless as to which ones I should prioritize higher. At my current university (DTU) I live at one of the most social and partying dorms, which I really enjoy. I would say that I'm very extrovert and social, even though I would prefer to have the opportunity to just be by myself occasionally. With this in mind, this is what my immediate impression of the two neighborhoods. Lakeshore: In general more quiet and (boring?), however closer to the engineering campus. Scenery should be beautiful which is nice, but if the people there aren't social, and I'll be more or less alone or isolated form social activities, I won't choose this area. South-east: Work-hard, play hard. However my impression is that this is primarily freshmen, which I'm not necessarily a big fan of. I'd prefer to live with someone about my age - if that's even possible at the dorms. Also a lot of people mention the lack of tidiness at the SE dorms. Is this a general problem? One final question: the Divison of University Housing sent me this prioritized list, recommending some of theorems. Do you have any comments on any of these? Especially the Tripp Transfer House? --**Tripp**- Transfer House- mostly single rooms; residents new to UW-Madison; however, not new to college life --**Adams**- International Learning Community- mostly single rooms; residents interested in global affairs  world cultures --**Tripp**- mostly single rooms; community with sophomore, junior  senior residents --**Phillips**- double rooms with a private bathroom inside the room --**Dejope**- community with mostly sophomore residents; 10-12 students sharing a bathroom; dining facility right inside the hall --**Merit**- single and double rooms; double rooms have a bathroom inside the room; community with sophomore, junior  senior residents --**Susan B. Davis**- all single rooms; community with sophomore, junior  senior residents    <eos> \n",

I was wondering if any of you have experience with going home for the summer, taking some classes at a community college (calc, bio, psych, general stuff etc.) and then transferring the credits back to UW-Madison? I'm from New York and if I could get some stuff done over the summer without staying in Madison that'd be great. Thoughts? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I have really had a hard time finding student orgs that fit my schedule and actually provide a good way to get to know people. I'm a bit of a quiet person, and it can take me a little while to feel comfortable enough to open up with others. I have heard that campus jobs can be helpful for making more friends. I'm tentatively majoring in English and Business or PoliSci. Any suggestions for fun, sociable jobs that aren't a ridiculous time commitment? I'm open to ideas for good student orgs, too.

Instead it will cost $1/hour or a $40 (for garages) or $125 (for surface lots) permit for the year.

I am going to be taking another 20 credits during the fall semester and am confident that I can pull up my GPA to a 3.7. My high school GPA was awful (I had a 2.5) But I also had an ACT of 30 that I am willing to retake. That being said, I am an out-of-state student, but I know that no matter what, I will be moving to Madison, WI. I have two strong recommendation letters and have an abundance of community service and internship experience. I started my own non-profit when I was 16 and it is based out of the country. (I am Mexican) I am sure that if I incorporate that into an essay, hopefully it will make me seem attractive.  Do I have a chance at getting in? <eos> \n",

Because of travel, this is my only chance to see UW before applications (and hopefully acceptance!) What should I know? Campus traditions, important sites to see, flaws, upsides, why the bookstore looks shady from the outside, anything about state st, things I shouldn't walk through or step on?

The main issue I'm having is that what it is asking for is not in any of the information that is given on DoIT's website. After selecting \"manual set up\" and \"Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync\", I need to provide: * E-mail address * Domain\\username * Password * Exchange server I have everything BUT the exchange server, and can't find that info anywhere. <eos> \n",

Apartments are pretty easy to find because everyone knows the major apartments (Lucky, Hub, X01, Grand Central) and I get flyers for apartment rental companies in my mailbox every day.

This will be my second semester on academic probation - struggling in school is getting old so I am looking to surround myself with others who have crossed the line from mediocrity to excellence.

However, I need to know what my time frame for deciding is. I'm almost entirely sure I'm going to this school, but I'd like to visit again and get some specifics on cost before I do anything more. If there is an advantage to clicking accept on the student center before the deadline, this will change my plan of action. I'm also not sure how much of a formality this is- I know that the housing deposit is generally the final deal sealer for colleges, so perhaps this is a lighter commitment that you're supposed to do even if you aren't 100% sure? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Dear Badgers, For some reason, Physics 201 (Yibin Pan's) class has been beating me up and I have scored consistently low on the previous 2 midterms (2 BC's) and I legit need a B and above as a final grade because I plan on transferring to ChemE.

I'm in the process of arranging a part 2 of this project, and am looking for any drummers (preferably who can access gear/recording equipment) who could add live drums to the backing and would like to be in the next video. I think it would add more depth and we could make a big production out of it. Lemme know if you're interested, and feel free to share this with people you know! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a CS major and spent last semester as a full-time intern at a tech company. While that was great and all, I'm 15 credits behind if I plan to graduate in 4 years while taking 15 credits per semester. I'm transferring in from a private out-of-state engineering school. The workload/difficulty should be relatively similar.  I'm currently a sophomore, but after the fall semester I'll be a junior, sitting at just over 60 credits. From there, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to handle 3 20 credit semesters - but it sounds like hell tbh. In the past I've done 16 credit semester while working an internship 15-20 hours a week, so I figure 20 credits would be similar to that (it sucked, but I made it work). Also, I know I have the option to cut this load down by taking summer classes. How many credits is it possible to earn in a summer? Is it going to be possible to catch back up at this point? <eos> \n",

I will, however, need to go offsite about 5-10 miles for a week every one or two months. I plan to use Uber (still investigating the most cost efficient method of transportation). Will it be easy to find an Uber at 500-530am near the campus? Thanks. <eos> \n",

I think I want to live in an apartment with some of the friends I've made here in the dorms but am not really sure. All I know for sure is that I want my own room(so I wont be \"sexiled\" like I have numerous times by roommate his gf) and that I want to live in/around the southeast area of campus. The whole situation seems very overwhelming as there are so many options and I dont really even know who I want to live with for sure. Could anyone shine some light on the situation/ give me their experience? Thanks  <eos> \n",

I currently have a lease signed on an apartment on Langdon and Henry with two (awesome) guys for the fall, but I currently don't really want to room with them anymore (for personal reasons, they're still awesome) and I have the option to switch to a different apartment, but I need to find a subletter for my current apartment before I can switch! Would anyone like to help me out please? It's a good price, the roommates are awesome, and you'd get your own bedroom! Males or females welcome! PM me for details if you think you'd be interested!!  P.S. Both of these guys are Redditors, so they're both extra awesome! You must be tree friendly though! <eos> \n",

I haven't played since coming to college so I don't know anyone who plays but I'm trying to pick it back up this summer! For context, I was like a NTRP level 3.5 or 4 back in high school. No idea what I would be now since I haven't played, but I'm not like a super beginner.  <eos> \n",

I'm curious if there are things you wish your TA had done to make the class less painful or if there are things your TA did that were awesome. I really enjoyed my organic lab classes, so I want to be able to make 344 enjoyable for my students as well. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I could summarize this whole post in one question: What the hell is going to be on the first midterm..?? Really need to hit a 4.0 this semester and this class seems like it is definitely one those classes thats easy to get... say... a B, but hard as hell to get an A because this man is providing no instruction what so ever. Like I said, I could really use the help of knowing what I'm actually going to be tested on, if anyone knows.. Because I sure dont.. Does the professor even know..? lmfao. Like I said, help (on what exactly I should be studying because he hasn't told anyone anything) would be appreciated. I pray I'm wrong, but this class seems like one of those classes where studying just gives you an opportunity to close your eyes and throw a dart at the dart board. I.e., seems to be you either luckily studied and remembered the right thing you didnt know you were supposed to know, or you unluckily studied the wrong thing and didnt know. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello people of the internet! My friend Victoria is an aspiring artist and she had an opportunity to display her work in our dormitory on the UW-Madison campus in Sellery Hall. Last week, she was told this particular piece was taken down because of its disturbing content. Just today, we found out that it wasn't taken down but STOLEN. If anyone has any information at all about it, please please please message me at awmoy@wisc.edu. This piece is very important to my friend and it took her a very long time to create. Share this with your friends so we can bring justice to the culprit.  TL;DR: Stolen art, please contact if you have information! [url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have no idea what to do. I slept through my alarms this morning and missed my ochem and psych exams - both with no make up exams. I can figure out OChem bc there are other grades involved but the psych course’s grade is made up of solely three exams. Even with 100% on exam 2  3, I could only get a D. I’m a transfer student and have been really struggling as is. I’m going to set up a meeting with an advisor but have no clue what the hell to do. Hoping I could possibly drop it and enroll in something else? Literally ANY suggestions would be helpful. I feel like such a piece of shit rn :-( I’m normally a great student but the transition has been difficult.  UPDATE: Chem prof is letting me retake it tomorrow morning. Still waiting on a response from Yuri. Meanwhile stressing tf out waiting patiently ...  THANK ALL OF YOU BTW. I felt super alone at the time of posting and you all showed me nothing but good intentions. It’s much appreciated as a new student here!  <eos> \n",

I'm already enrolled in two programming-heavy courses (CS 752 and CS 758) and I'm looking for a third course which is relatively less demanding, but still hoping to learn enough from it. Is it a good idea to take CS 520 being taught by Jin-Yi Cai? My undergrad was in electrical engineering and I've not studied this material before. How difficult is this course? I've heard good things about the instructor, but I also hear he's not easy to follow at times. <eos> \n",

Which CS or math courses above the 400 level would you guys say are pretty easy? Only upper level courses here I've taken are CS 564, CS 537, CS 540, CS 577, Math 435.  I'm not too good at proofs, so for the Math course, if it's more proof-based instead of computational or applications-based, I may not be too good at it. Thanks a ton, guys! <eos> \n",

Other B1G schools were not as fortunate (looking at you, Michigan). [Here is a shot]([url link] of the entire finished board, where we are clearly visible in the lower left corner.

            "<bos> Hey guys, so I'm a sophomore living in Humbucker (there's five of us, 3 bed 2 bath), and liking it a lot more than the dorms last year. Recently, three of us started talking about what we'd like to do next year for a living situation. We know for sure that the 3 of us want to continue living together, but our tentative plans range from just us 3 to a total of 6 guys living together. I was just wondering, from those who have had a variety of housing experiences over your time here, which you thought was the most quality/valuable? We like our location right now relative to classes and such, and don't like the idea of living in a straight up house, although a town house sounds nice. Anyway, just looking for some input to help guide our decision for next year. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

However, I read that they are increasing the aid to be more competitive. Does anyone know how much they give and is it any? I know Ohio State gives the National Buckeye (50,000 over 4 years) to anyone above the required stats. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I had one all through college up until Senior year. Many people loved the shirt and I always got complimented on it and it became quickly a big part of my college career as I would wear it every gameday. Senior year it got stolen from me and I was really upset. So now I am looking for someone who has one that they would be willing to sell. Medium or Large size. I am willing to overpay by a good amount just to have the keepsake of it. So if you have one or know someone who does, maybe ask and see if they are willing to part with it? Thanks. <eos> \n",

When I look at DARS, it says that I have two majors declared as well as a certificate (all in LS), and at this point I just want to graduate with the one major as I haven't done anything with the other stuff for over a year. Does anyone know if you have to undeclare with the unwanted major's departmental advisor in order to get it off your transcript? My current major has a brand new academic advisor who isn't entirely sure what to do... <eos> \n",

I know the grade I get in that class doesn't count towards my UW Madison GPA, but is there a minimum grade I would need (my guess is it would be either a C or a D) for it to transfer? I have an 80% in it right now but the final is coming up and I want to prioritize my other exams (that *do* count toward my GPA) and I want to know how hard I can bomb this final and still have it count. Semi-related: if you are scared of taking calc at UW, taking it online through Madison College is a solid alternative. I never even took precalc and I am doing fine in this even with wolfram alpha-ing all the homeworks.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

But that doesn't mean I don't want a social life.  As for academics, I have actual interest in lots of different things. (math, linguistics, physics, biochemistry, history, poly sci, comp sci). I'll probably major in math since I've taken a fair number of college classes in it already, but that doesn't preclude other studies. <eos> \n",

But that was pretty early on, and I know now that it isn't the thing for me, and I'm planning on switching to marketing (already changed my classes to pre-business). I'm not super worried about getting into the business school, as I have a 3.27 overall GPA from some harder classes, and a 4.0 pre-business GPA right now (I also plan on joining a club or two with a friend also majoring in marketing). I'm just curious what the official \"procedure\" for cancelling the major is, as the school is pretty vague about it online, or if anyone has any experience with it. I am obviously going to meet with advisers when I get back to campus in a few weeks. I'm still considering changing it to a certificate if I have time, as I only need 4 more comp sci classes for that. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

Just FYI, the class I'm swapping is EPD 397 - ART 107 (apparently 107 has lectures now), and the lectures that are back-to-back are ART 107 first and ECE 552 right after.

Wall-to-wall spam, even beyond the junk mail filter. Even \"Unsubscribe\" rarely seemed to work. Ever wonder why? In UW's own words: The University of Wisconsin-Madison frequently receives requests for student email and postal addresses from third-party vendors such as credit card companies, off-campus housing, etc and also from Registered Student Organizations (RSO). Shitty. Fortunately, you can opt out of this. In your Student Center (my.wisc.edu Student Services Student Center, for you rookies), scroll to the bottom - underneath \"Academics\" and \"Finances\" is a section for \"Personal Information\". Click on the drop-down box (\"other personal...\") and select \"Restrict Third-Party Mail\".

Few ECE/MATH classes are still open but I realized I can swap out one of these classes for some gen ed class if this is too much work.   1) Are these classes manageable together? I was confident I'd be able to handle classes like 577 and 353 because I know others taking it.  2) Should I even worry about taking these classes as a Junior? I'd like to get as much exposure early to explore different fields but I can also postpone these classes for next year. <eos> \n",

They insisted that I should have gotten it at Target because it's still free and Target gives you a $5 gift card and that it would technically be worth it more for me. However, my opinion is that since 250 bucks of our tuition per semester goes to UHS and I've technically already paid for that flu shot, I might as well take advantage of it and go there. What is your opinion? <eos> \n",

I don't want to jump the gun and ruin my chances, but I also don't want to wait forever and look lazy. <eos> \n",

Ill be working at American Family Insurance which happens to be near the Dane County airport so I'd prefer an apartment that isn't too south of UW (for example south of Regent St. if that makes sense). Something closer to the Wisconsin State Capitol would be nice. Please DM if you are subleasing, thanks! <eos> \n",

I will be residing in dorms in college, so I am told I need to get two immunizations - Hepatitis B and Meningococcal Vaccine.  Besides these two, are there any more required immunizations? I found this page [url link] which lists a few other vaccines, but I'm not sure if they're recommended or required. I ask this because I'm scared as all hell of needles so I want as less vaccines as possible lol.  <eos> \n",

With AP and Placements Tests I am done with my depth and breadth and humanities requirements as well as through math 234 and physics 207 and 208. My question is should I stick with Chem 104, ECE 210, ECE 252, COMP SCI 200, INTEREGR 110, AFROAMER 156 Or should I take AFROAMER 156 later. Without taking it I would only be at 13 credits and that seems to be laking. Thanks for any advice. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I have been doing a lot of research about the dorms here at UW-Madison and I am really torn. I really like the location of the Lakeshore dorms, but on the other hand I also like the social aspect of the Southeast dorms. I would describe myself as a fairly reserved person (I am definitely introverted), but I enjoy meeting new people and can be social when the right time arises, which is why I think the Southeast dorms would be a good fit. I am also a very active individual (I exercise on a daily basis) and the easy access to running paths by Lakeshore is a huge plus and I absolutely love being immersed in nature. I smoke a good amount of weed and drink occasionally, so I definitely want to do some partying, but I hear Lakeshore is not the greatest area to do so. I am leaning towards Lakeshore because of its location and spacious dorms; I’m just worried I won’t get along with people as well in a quieter environment. How difficult would it be to find like-minded people in Lakeshore and which dorm do you think is the best fit for me? Any input is greatly appreciated, thanks! <eos> \n",

I think they are only like 30 bucks, so I could get 2 of them and come out ahead. I also would really only use my moped to drive to the library, which would be primarily after 5 or 6 pm, do they even check for permits that late? 85 bucks is such bullshit. /end rant <eos> \n",

Surprisingly, none of my friends have taken it here and have all done it elsewhere. If I don't get an A, it won't be the end of the world, and I am taking 345 in the fall, as well as physics 103 with lab and Microbio 303  304 (major specific course and lab). Can anyone let me know the workload and output needed to succeed in 344? I want to know if it is actually so challenging that I should just wait until next summer, thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I’ll be a freshman this fall in the Electrical Engineering program and am wondering whether to get my chem requirements done with in a single semester of 109, or go the 103 and 104 route. My worry is that 109 will be too difficult since I did not take AP chem (only general chem) in high school. I have a feeling that I could struggle through 109, but don’t want my studying for it to interfere with other classes the first semester. Can anyone who’s been in a similar situation speak to this?  EDIT: Thank you all for the thoughtful responses! I think I’m gonna go with 109 for now, and drop down to 103 if I’m drowning. <eos> \n",

Is there a real price benefit or am I better off finding a place independent of the college?  Another hurdle is that it needs to be wheelchair accessible, and I'm finding in the city it's WAY more expensive if you have any accommodations.  Also while I'm here, anyone have tips on grad\\-loans? I'm low\\-income and the idea of just milking the money I can take out from the school/ feds sounds pretty nice and I have 10 year loan forgiveness.  <eos> \n",

However, there is another lecture that starts at a time that is just perfect for my schedule, and the professor is rated a whole point more on Rate My Professor, but all the sections are completely full (those red squares). If one student drops out, will someone from the wait list get the spot or will anyone be able to claim it? How often is it that you have managed to get into these classes with no open spots? I just got out of my wait list last week for another class I applied in May so I hope it doesn't drag on for too long. You can only swap classes till the first two or three weeks, right? I thought of emailing the professor, but what can I say? \"I wanted to get in because this fits a better time schedule\"? <eos> \n",

They always walk either right in the middle of the sidewalk or zigzag aimlessly so that it's impossible to pass them. I can always tell when I'm approaching someone with headphones in or who's on their phone because: 1. they are walking way slower than everyone else 2. they don't notice everyone's passing them 3. zigzagging/walking in the middle of the sidewalk 4. cutting you off when you are right behind them trying to pass Am I the only one annoyed by this or am I just walking too aggressively?

I transferred in to school here last semester (Spring 2014) and chose the option to live in the transfer dorms (Tripp Hall) so I could have a single room. Long story short I decided to come back and live in the same room since I missed all the lease signings for THIS year. So now since it's time to already look into living for next year I have this curveball thrown to me that I will most likely be graduating in a total of 3 and 1/2 years (December of next year) and I am having a hard time finding living for next year. Since all of the leases are for a year I don't want to be stuck with a lease, and everybody I was planning to live with doesn't want a subletter in their place for their last semester. Which I understand. So my question to anybody out there who can help is are there any suggestions? The only two that can come to mind at the moment are just subletting a place for the fall from somebody (don't know how common that is), or just having to come back and live in my dorm YET AGAIN for the last semester since the contract can be broken with graduation. I really can't think of anything else. Anybody have any suggestions? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I've aced all the quizzes and such up to now, but am extremely unconfident with my abilities to do well on a test. This is really worrying to me because I only took this class because I heard it was an easy A... From ratemyprofessor.com, lol. Anyways, I feel like I might fall short in here and need some help. What should I really be studying for the first test..? Anything in particular? Does she give out a study guide for the test? I haven't done any of the readings as of yet because they seemed really irrelevant to the class material, will I see that on the test? Any help from anyone who has taken it would be a life saver.

            "<bos> Hey all. I enjoy staying in shape through sports, and I thought it was a big sell that UW has a lot to offer in that area in terms of recreation. However, I had a few questions regarding rec sports. While they may sound dumb, please bear with me. 1) What is the difference between intramural sports and club sports? I read the FAQs and I didn't really get much out of them regarding the differences between the two. 2) Are there any clubs/teams/sports that one should avoid? I don't mean to sound like a jerk, and that it could be my duty to help out if necessary, but I'm just trying to find out if any of the teams are populated with slapdicks/inexperienced people. 3) Is it possible/reasonable to do more than one sport? As a future NROTC Midshipman, I probably shouldn't be asking this question, but I want to have a solid foundational sport such as the tri team, and then explore other opportunities, such as boxing, polo, kung fu, or frisbee. 4) Could anyone divulge any information specifically on the running, swimming, cycling, tri, and water polo teams? I would email the advisors, but I also want to hear other perspectives from the students that may have taken them. Anything from level of intensity, days per week, hours per week, general atmosphere etc. helps. 5) What are the roads like in Madison? While I know that Ironman is hosted here, I'm just unsure of what the roads would be like due to all the rain and snow. I've wrecked a bike before trying to ride with a light drizzle out once, and I kind of have a fear of riding in inclement weather now. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just finished my first year attending UW Madison and unfortunately, I did not do well at all. My GPA is below 2.0, and though I passed all of my classes, and thus got credit for them, I was placed on academic probation after my first semester and I'm now dealing with a one year \"suspension\". There were a handful of reasons, all of them my fault, as to why I did so badly my first year. For one, hubris in that I thought college academics might resemble high school in some way (conclusion: they don't), and since I did well in high school I figured I wouldn't struggle much in university. Additionally, I was chronically lazy and didn't finish much of my homework at all. I know for a fact that I'd still be attending Madison if I finished all of my assignments, but hindsight is always 20-20, I guess. Nevertheless, I'm facing a one year suspension from UW as previously stated, and I figured going to my hometown for a couple semesters might be good for me. I think this choice will help me out doubly since I won't have to pay for housing and I can regroup and focus on my academics and why I did so poorly my first year. I really regret my choices, I loved it in Madison, I had so many good times and met many wonderful people, so I truly hope I can return some day. I just have a few questions about my situation. Will I be considered a transfer student at UWGB? Will I be allowed back into UW-Madison after my one year suspension has expired, providing I do well in my courses this year? Has anyone else been in a similar situation that could offer me any advice? All responses are appreciated. <eos> \n",

I got a 3 on the test, and the UW Madison AP website says I'll get 3 biology elective credits. Problem is, since I only got a 3, I needed to take Zoology (or Biology whatever) 151/152, and did take this my freshman year. Could me taking this course influences whether or not I get my AP credits? I will be talking with my academic advisor but just wanted to see if anyone else had experience with this.  <eos> \n",

I'm interested in a career in radiology, so I told that to my advisor at MATC. She said that UW doesn't have a radiology program, and that I need to do some research.  But, I thought they had a radiology program? I mean, there's a website for it! Am I wrong? Someone please help me! Thanks! And sorry if this is a stupid question! <eos> \n",

As we make the move into the Big Ten, we're looking into traditions at the other schools in the conference to teach our fans about the new neighbors. What are some of the campus and sports traditions (official or unofficial) that make Wisconsin special? Extra credit: Does Wisconsin have a similar organization that works with traditions on campus?

            "<bos> I was just admitted as a rising junior to the BBA Program and was wondering if it is worth it to give up my Economics Emphasis in Math major along with a Computer Science certificate. A lot has changed since I applied and now I am rather content with what I study now, having handpicked all my classes for the next two years. I also realize I would have to cram basically the entire program (minus a few econ and math classes) into my last two years at UW, and most of the core and prep classes do not even interest me. Is the BBA program really better for finding a job after I graduate? Is it as fulfilling? Thanks. <eos> \n",

Ideas can be as small (swimming in Mendota, movies on the terrace) or as large (concerts, day trip to devil's lake) as you want. There are a lot of days in the summer so give me all you have!

We're focusing on YouTube shorts and are working on a stand-up duo routine. We write every week and try to shoot just as frequently. I'm the \"bathroom abuser in this sketch.\" We're both using these side projects as resume boosters as well as writing, casting, directing, filming, and editing experience. But most importantly, it's a means for those interested in working in the entertainment industry to network start building a contact base now.  This is the first of many videos, and soon we'll have our own YouTube channel once we get more projets up here - the other videos on this channel are not our own. Quality will increase with time. We can really do some great things with this and start to get some more viral videos out there centered in Mad Town besides the beloved, \"Teach Me How To Bucky.\"  If you guys are interested in getting involved in any projects, consider the student org, 1-UP. THIS VIDEO IS A MOCKUMENTARY SPAWNING FROM THE IDEA THAT ROOMMATES WALK IN ON EACH OTHER IN THE BATHROOM DOING SOME STRANGE THINGS. WE EXPANDED ON THAT.  <eos> \n",

Although I know that Madison is a very liberal city, I also know that there is not a large percentage of Asian people there and the lack of exposure to Asian people might result in some subtle racism.

Poking around Microsoft's side, I found that some students can receive a free copy of Office 365 Education [here]([url link] I tried signing up with my @wisc.edu email address but Madison is apparently not eligible. I looked on the [DoIT page about it]([url link] which seems to say that the reason why we aren't eligible is because of Madison's calendar/e-mail system.  Why is this the case? Is Madison offering any other way for us to get the other parts of Office 365 besides the email and calendar systems? Am I basically stuck paying $140 for the full version of office if I want to have Word or Excel on my tablet? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I am gonna take CS 540 (AI) this semester and I was wondering how much workload I could expect? I've heard this is one of the easier advanced CS classes, or at least as easy as advanced CS classes get. Is there only homework or programming projects as well? I've looked at some of the previous semesters' class pages and they have mentioned no projects, but I definitely remember a senior on my floor working on a CS 540 project just last fall. So I'm a little confused if these assignments depend on the professor and are not there by default. If so, how are these programming assignments? Any place where I can find them? As I mentioned, I checked the previous semesters' pages and I couldn't find any. I would want to see what these projects are on at least so I can kinda prepare for them in these last days of vacation. For example, if the projects include trees/graphs I could review those properties. Thanks for the help! <eos> \n",

I'd like to know any info about the Communications program here. I've always been interested in the television/film business, and getting a degree and possibly working in the field has been a dream of mine for a while. I'd also kind of like to know if I'd be able to get in to Madison. (I know, typical high-schooler question.) I have a 3.84 GPA as of last semester, and I just got a 29 on the ACT. I've been in stage crew since freshman year, and I'll be in my school's National Honor Society chapter next year. I also might join AFS and possibly Forensics next year. I've always felt not smart enough to get in, because I know Madison is pretty competitive, but maybe that's just me being self-deprecating.

I messed up and took on more than I could handle, thinking I would be able to pull things off until long after the drop date. Basically, I ended up not really going to class, which I get is totally on me; I probably won't go to the professor/TA because I honestly just didn't try in the class and I deserve an F. My question is, what happens now? Despite the F, I'm on track to get a 2.4-2.7 GPA this semester, which is good. Will I be placed on academic probation, or is that just if my GPA drops below 2 as a whole? The class is a gen ed, and not directly related to my major.  Additionally, I'm studying abroad next semester (Spring 2016). Will failing a class this fall affect that at all? I've been accepted into the program on all fronts, already have my plane ticket, etc. I'm also certain that I'll be able to get above a 3.0 for the rest of my college career.

Most of my established hobbies (ie: racing cars, building computers) are full of mostly guys. Since starting grad school, i've been trying to put myself into clubs (ie: ballroom dancing) to meet more diverse people and maybe try to get into a relationship.  The problem is, as a grad student, I am having a hard time tending to any of my hobbies or going to any club meetings, let alone trying to find someone to build a relationship with. I have tried dating apps and found them to be very unreliable as dates often flake out and profiles can be misleading.

So I got accepted to UW yesterday and will most likely be going there. I'm from India and was wondering which dorm is the best...

I am currently a high school senior and I was recently offered admission to the School of Agriculture and Life Sciences at UW-Madison. My first choice major was Computer Engineering, but they accepted me into my second choice, which was \"Machinery Systems Engineering\" on my common app. I didn\\'t realize this was in the school of agriculture and I would really like to transfer into the school of engineering if I decide to go to Madison.  What would be the process for that and what would I need to do to have the best chance of getting in to ENGR? How easy/hard is it to transfer? I\\'m just worried that if I don\\'t get into engineering I will be stuck in a major I really do not want to study since the transfer isn\\'t guaranteed. <eos> ', \"<bos> Housing preferences opened up today and I have a decent idea of my top 3, but after that I don't really know.  <eos> \", '<bos> Currently a biochem major that needs to take 6 more humanities credits with literature breadth to graduate, any easy classes enjoyable classes you guys can recommend? <eos> ', \"<bos> I heard clap for credit (Music 113) has changed.

Also, since I have very little prior programming experience, will this class be difficult for me? I’ve been exposed to the Swift language, but the most I remember are the data types and how to create loops and if/else statements. Is this CS 302 a good indication of whether I will like computer science if I do well/enjoy it? Or will I need to take CS 367 to determine that? I’m also taking math 171 this semester. I know math 221 is recommended but I’ve never taken calc in high school, which is why I went with a lower level. I know computer science is very math-intensive, and I’ve always been in “regular” math classes for most of high school. I took an honors precalc course my senior year, and I earned an A, but I had to bust my ass to do it. I enjoy solving problems and getting the correct answers, but math has not been enjoyable for me since I often had to grasp and understand the material on my own (my math teachers in high school were not very good at teaching). So, I feel like if I’m average at best when it comes to math, then computer science isn’t for me. <eos> ', \"<bos> Hi everyone! I am really desperate for students and graduates 18 years or older to take a survey for my masters dissertation on rural Americans' knowledge of and attitudes about study opportunities abroad. If you are 18 or older, grew up in a rural area, and are either a current student, recent graduate, or about to start a new higher education program (Bachelor's or above), please please please take a moment to complete the survey. Even if you didn't study abroad and don't plan to, I still want your input! It won't take more than 20 minutes to complete. If you can, please share this with other rural students and recent grads. The more responses I get, the better my dissertation will be.

I was thinking of throwing this course into my plan for next semester which includes Human Geography 101 (Comm B), Philosophy 100, CS 240, and CS 354.

They hold 1,500 tickets for grad students to buy every year. I'm not sure if they sell out or not, but they don't sell nearly as fast as the undergrad sale. If you are an undergrad and didn't get football tickets and you know a grad student who isn't interested in getting tickets for themselves, then I would buddy up with them and maybe kick a few bucks their way to get you tickets. It's a virtual guarantee that they get tickets if they log in at all tomorrow morning.

Due to my financial situation, I’m living out of a mini bus: [url link] However, I’m not sure how to handle parking during the year. Normally I’d purchase a pass from the UW system, but I suspect they would hassle me over parking the bus, even though it fits into a standard parking space, in their lot. So, that leaves me looking for private parking. I’m interested in an overground lot (as opposed to an indoor garage) since I rely on roof solar panels to generate the energy that refrigerates my food. Ideally, for this reason, I would also prefer if the space wasn’t nudged between two buildings. I’m willing to pay a reasonable amount for a parking space, and would prefer somewhere close-ish to campus, since I mostly walk. Alternatively, if there’s a free space curbside area that I likely wouldn’t get hassled in, that would also work. I mostly keep to myself/remain quiet, and I try not to move the bus unless I need to. I don’t leave trash laying around the car or anything like that. Do you guys have any ideas for a decent parking location to call “home” next year?  <eos> ', '<bos> Planning on majoring in chemistry.

I know it may seem risky giving your shoes to people you don't know well, but we're willing to do whatever is necessary to show you this is legit.

As part of the project, ALL revenues go to the charity (ideas range from Dane County Humane Society to Porchlight).

I've been wondering if the school itself offers classes such as EMT Basic or Lifeguard Instructor that can be taken as electives for credit.

I am currently a freshman attending UConn and was wondering about my chances at gaining acceptance to UW-Madison as a transfer student for Fall 2016.

If I can't get into the School of Business then I'll do mathematics as my major and a minor in the School of Business. I did well in high school, taking a total of 10 AP's and getting a 4 or 5 on 9 of them. I ended high school with a 4.7 GPA on a 5.0 scale.

I'm from a smaller town in northeastern Wisconsin and I know of maybe two other people in my high school that are also going here.

I like my roommate and talk to him quite a bit, but we don't hang outside of the dorms beside a few exceptions. I also have joined a couple of clubs and talk to people in classes, and I've made a few friends that way, with one being the guy I usually hang with. Problem is almost all of my friends are near Dejope, which is a 25 minute walk or a decently long bus ride whenever we want to hang out. My floor at Witte is definitely social, but I went to sleep early the first night I moved in while apparently everyone in my dorm met and got to know each other.

I'm currently set to take Calc 3 via dual enrollment with Oshkosh for 2nd semester. Yet Madison doesn't accept the credit for it, so there isn't really a point in taking it to begin with.  I've emailed the Admissions office but they gave the generic response of not approving or denying schedule changes. But just leaving the ominous note of it MAY cause admission to be rescinded. Is there a good chance that this can cause my admission to be revoked if I do drop Calc 3? I'm not even currently taking it. It also seems foolish for a school to first tell somebody that they cannot receive credit for a class, but then also turn around and tell them they cannot drop it either. <eos> \", \"<bos> [url link] Without a car, I am kind of restricted to the campus and surrounding area.

If you can answer any of them or give me any general advice, I\\'d appreciate it! 1. I\\'m planning on majoring in Comm Arts and I\\'m looking at the FIGs options and some of them sound very cool to me. Will taking a FIG put me off my \"path\" to my major? Would you recommend FIGs? I also will probably be only able to go to a later SOAR, so how does that factor in to class selection? Just any sort of clarification on the course selection process would be great and how to avoid getting screwed over by SOAR. 2. How big are the dorms in Sellery or Witte? I know they give dorm sizes, but does it feel small? 3. How does one go about buying season tickets for the football games? 4. Should I go random roommate or try to connect with someone using the new Roomsync thing? 5. Is there anything you wish you knew when you were coming in as a freshmen?

I am also premed so I do spend a decent time studying and getting involved on campus. However, I am a very social person and I would like to live somewhere where I could meet lots of students.

At the moment i am trying to choose resident halls but I have limited knowledge on them so i would like some help. Just some info: I am in my 3rd year of university so i think that means I'm a 'junior' at college. I am studying Kinesiology so most of my classes will be at the Natatorium. Based on this info, it seems Dejope and Phillips are the best pick for me. Can anyone give me some of their experiences at these halls? edit: So I've had a look at the info on each hall and the conclusion I've made is that in Phillips has its own bathroom but Dejope has more people to socialise with.

My last semester before winter break I earned less than a 2.0 (still passed all my classes that semester), however, because I had a previous semester with &lt; 2.0, I was informed via e-mail of my suspension. My first three semesters here I had a 4.0, but it just spiraled down after that. I blame stress. Stressed out about saving up for student loans, paying rent and bills.

I had, incredibly stupidly, forgot that it was required as opposed to recommended, and so just reached out to a professor Friday. The problem is, they declined since I didn't really speak much in their class, and didn't feel like they could've written a good recommendation. They were really the only professor that could've spoken to my academic ability, since a number of my classes are lectures and I really haven't formed any good enough relationships with any professors who could write one. Anyone have any suggestions or advice? The letter is required and I can think of absolutely no professor who could write this letter for me. I asked a former coach to write one just as a supplementary recommendation but aside from that I've got absolutely no one.

I am currently a freshman with a strong interest in the biology field. However, I have a few questions related to the topic of biology.

Some of them require prerequisites but I heard that prereqs aren't enforced for CS.  Is this still true or did they start enforcing them? I was looking at 352 but 252 is a prereq. Could I still enroll without taking 252? My position is kind of tricky because I haven't satisfied quantitative reasoning A, so I can't enroll for any CS courses until around August (when I get that credit). I assume because I haven't satisfied QR A, a prerequisite, other requisites will also be enforced? Or is it just because QR A is a general requirement?

All of your programs you must write in your team of 6, (and of course this leads to differential effort and levels of understanding in the group), and for the quizzes, only 2 randomly chosen people in the group have to take the quiz, and the grade for everyone in the group is based off of the average of the two. Also, team participation is worth 10% of your overall grade.  Personally, I feel like this is detrimental to my learning, and dealing with shitty group members is much more frustrating than trying to learn the material by myself.

In addition, I was told recently that there may be scholarships for autistic students. Though I am not technically diagnosed of it (yet), my parents and I are pretty convinced that I have some type of Austism Spectrum Disorder. I did recently spend some time with a neuropsychologist for this reason, so I should be getting a diagnosis in the next few weeks. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

I know that every other year when I accept financial aid, whatever I accept is split between fall term and spring term. Obviously, I won\\'t be here for spring term. So, let\\'s hypothetically say I want $2,000 for this fall. Should I accept $2,000, or $4,000? The grants I received are only for the fall semester...so I\\'m thinking it\\'s likely I just take $2,000 if that\\'s how much I need.

I am currently planning on majoring in Political Science and minoring in either History, sociology, religious studies, or something else of that genre.

I don't drink, smoke weed, etc. Is it possible to avoid the party scene or is it just embedded in the school's social life? Thanks for listening! <eos> \", \"<bos> Hello! I am currently a Freshman at another 4 year college majoring in Psychology and I would like to know some tips on what I would need in order transfer to UW-Madison as a Sophomore. I know that according to their Transfer Admission site, you need to have at least 24 transferable credits. But I also hear that you need a relatively high GPA in order to be considered. My stats as of Fall 2016 is a GPA is 3.7 with 17 credits, and in the Spring 2017 Semester, another 15 Credits will be completed. With a total of 32 transferable credits I already pass the 24 credit mark. But other than the credits, what else do they look for? The site was not very specific, but I'm worried because I barely have any extracurriculars. So I guess my main question is, do they look at college extracurriculars and high GPAs too?  <eos> \", '<bos> Anyone personally or know anyone who has worked here while going to school?

Next stop 15GB! **WELL DONE**  Dropbox is having a SpaceRace. The more people sign up under a schools name the more space everyone at that school has. UW is close to 8GB.

Well now the time is ticking down and I have a terrible sense of direction so does anyone know of a tour I can sneak in if my friend can't show me?

It\\'s about a fairly gruesome study going on in UW-Madison about housecats that supposedly involves all sorts of horrible things like invasive brain surgery while the animal is awake, injection of toxic substance to deafen the animal, i.e., blatant animal cruelty. [url link] Well, I waded through the expected shocking nature of this article and was frustrated to find no real evidence outside of their website as to what is actually going on in this lab. They keep quoting the \"experimenters\" (notice, they don\\'t refer to them as scientists, heh) without any hard reference to an interview. Also, things like, \"Their records show...,\" with no reference to that, either (besides maybe a link to another page in their website). They could be completely manipulating what was said in the interview or records, right? Well, anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this; maybe personally, or maybe just word-of-mouth. Or, if not, what do you think about the article in context of your experience at the University, or your field, etc.? I want to know if I should question the legislation of ethics employed here at UW-Madison, or if it\\'s just PETA manipulating images to hit me in the feels. Whatever happened to \"Double Trouble\" has to be something pretty awful - I feel kind of sick thinking about if everything this article states is true. But, I have a hard time believing that blatant animal cruelty is at work behind our scientific community. Thoughts? Edit: I\\'m not sure why I\\'m getting downvotes here. I was kind of opening up discussion to something that possibly might be relevant (it\\'s actually exactly relevant) to UW-Madison. Not trying to say it\\'s a valid article or anything - I mean it\\'s PETA, lol. But I didn\\'t want to have to come out and say it like that. If you disagree with something about the subject of the post, perhaps discuss it, rather than downvoting it so nobody else will see this!  <eos> ', '<bos> I went to wendt commons (4th floor) today to do some work. I got there at like 10:50. When I got there, I looked at the board, and it said only talbes 1-7 (or something) were reserved from 11:00-12:15. I sat at a table that was not one that the board said was reserved (the table itself had a sign that said it was open, whereas some tables had little \"reserved\" signs on them). At 1:10 a guy (the instructor?) came and said that the table was reserved (and was pretty mean about it). I got up and left.  I really liked studying at Wendt, but this has sort of soured me on the experience. Is there a way that I\\'m supposed to know what tables are to be reserved when? I thought that I was in the clear because the board (when I walked in at least) didn\\'t say that the table that I was at was reserved, and the table I was at didn\\'t have one of the reserved flags.  <eos> ', \"<bos> For those who take CS577 this semester, how well do you do in class right now?

I ran track throughout high school, it was my main sport and now that it's in season again I'm starting to really miss it! I sort of screwed myself out of going to state last year (I'm a freshman) by choosing to run the individual 800m instead of the 400m. Turned out the other 800m runners were beyond me but with the split I ran in my 4x4 at sectionals, I would have gone to state in the individual. My 4x4 split was a 50.3 but I'm confident I could have run below 50 if I had gone to state. If I were to join the team I would think I'd run the 400m. My 800m PR was 2:03, so it wasn't bad but I don't think it's good enough to run at Madison. My questions are these: Are my times fast enough to earn a place on the team? What should I do to go about joining the team? How difficult is it to balance school and practice/meets? If you can think of anything else I should know then feel free to tell me that as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!                                          Edit: Looks like a common theme here is the Track Club!

I would say that I'm very extrovert and social, even though I would prefer to have the opportunity to just be by myself occasionally. With this in mind, this is what my immediate impression of the two neighborhoods. Lakeshore: In general more quiet and (boring?), however closer to the engineering campus. Scenery should be beautiful which is nice, but if the people there aren't social, and I'll be more or less alone or isolated form social activities, I won't choose this area. South-east: Work-hard, play hard. However my impression is that this is primarily freshmen, which I'm not necessarily a big fan of.

If there is an advantage to clicking accept on the student center before the deadline, this will change my plan of action. I'm also not sure how much of a formality this is- I know that the housing deposit is generally the final deal sealer for colleges, so perhaps this is a lighter commitment that you're supposed to do even if you aren't 100% sure? <eos> \", \"<bos> Dear Badgers, For some reason, Physics 201 (Yibin Pan's) class has been beating me up and I have scored consistently low on the previous 2 midterms (2 BC's) and I legit need a B and above as a final grade because I plan on transferring to ChemE.

While that was great and all, I'm 15 credits behind if I plan to graduate in 4 years while taking 15 credits per semester. I'm transferring in from a private out-of-state engineering school. The workload/difficulty should be relatively similar.  I'm currently a sophomore, but after the fall semester I'll be a junior, sitting at just over 60 credits. From there, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to handle 3 20 credit semesters - but it sounds like hell tbh. In the past I've done 16 credit semester while working an internship 15-20 hours a week, so I figure 20 credits would be similar to that (it sucked, but I made it work).

Like I said, help (on what exactly I should be studying because he hasn't told anyone anything) would be appreciated. I pray I'm wrong, but this class seems like one of those classes where studying just gives you an opportunity to close your eyes and throw a dart at the dart board.

My friend Victoria is an aspiring artist and she had an opportunity to display her work in our dormitory on the UW-Madison campus in Sellery Hall.

I really like the location of the Lakeshore dorms, but on the other hand I also like the social aspect of the Southeast dorms. I would describe myself as a fairly reserved person (I am definitely introverted), but I enjoy meeting new people and can be social when the right time arises, which is why I think the Southeast dorms would be a good fit. I am also a very active individual (I exercise on a daily basis) and the easy access to running paths by Lakeshore is a huge plus and I absolutely love being immersed in nature. I smoke a good amount of weed and drink occasionally, so I definitely want to do some partying, but I hear Lakeshore is not the greatest area to do so. I am leaning towards Lakeshore because of its location and spacious dorms; I’m just worried I won’t get along with people as well in a quieter environment. How difficult would it be to find like-minded people in Lakeshore and which dorm do you think is the best fit for me?

I enjoy staying in shape through sports, and I thought it was a big sell that UW has a lot to offer in that area in terms of recreation. However, I had a few questions regarding rec sports. While they may sound dumb, please bear with me. 1) What is the difference between intramural sports and club sports?

I don't mean to sound like a jerk, and that it could be my duty to help out if necessary, but I'm just trying to find out if any of the teams are populated with slapdicks/inexperienced people. 3) Is it possible/reasonable to do more than one sport? As a future NROTC Midshipman, I probably shouldn't be asking this question, but I want to have a solid foundational sport such as the tri team, and then explore other opportunities, such as boxing, polo, kung fu, or frisbee. 4) Could anyone divulge any information specifically on the running, swimming, cycling, tri, and water polo teams?

My GPA is below 2.0, and though I passed all of my classes, and thus got credit for them, I was placed on academic probation after my first semester and I\\'m now dealing with a one year \"suspension\". There were a handful of reasons, all of them my fault, as to why I did so badly my first year. For one, hubris in that I thought college academics might resemble high school in some way (conclusion: they don\\'t), and since I did well in high school I figured I wouldn\\'t struggle much in university. Additionally, I was chronically lazy and didn\\'t finish much of my homework at all. I know for a fact that I\\'d still be attending Madison if I finished all of my assignments, but hindsight is always 20-20, I guess. Nevertheless, I\\'m facing a one year suspension from UW as previously stated, and I figured going to my hometown for a couple semesters might be good for me. I think this choice will help me out doubly since I won\\'t have to pay for housing and I can regroup and focus on my academics and why I did so poorly my first year. I really regret my choices, I loved it in Madison, I had so many good times and met many wonderful people, so I truly hope I can return some day. I just have a few questions about my situation. Will I be considered a transfer student at UWGB? Will I be allowed back into UW-Madison after my one year suspension has expired, providing I do well in my courses this year? Has anyone else been in a similar situation that could offer me any advice? All responses are appreciated. <eos> ', \"<bos> Hey guys, I am currently a freshman planning to get a house / apartment for 6 people.

I was looking at my DARS report and saw that my AP Biology credits were not there. I got a 3 on the test, and the UW Madison AP website says I'll get 3 biology elective credits. Problem is, since I only got a 3, I needed to take Zoology (or Biology whatever) 151/152, and did take this my freshman year.

I'm at the University of Maryland, and I'm part of a group dedicated to preserving and maintaining school traditions.

A lot has changed since I applied and now I am rather content with what I study now, having handpicked all my classes for the next two years. I also realize I would have to cram basically the entire program (minus a few econ and math classes) into my last two years at UW, and most of the core and prep classes do not even interest me. Is the BBA program really better for finding a job after I graduate? Is it as fulfilling?

I just got a Surface Pro, which does not come with any Office stuff besides OneNote. Poking around Microsoft's side, I found that some students can receive a free copy of Office 365 Education [here]([url link] I tried signing up with my @wisc.edu email address but Madison is apparently not eligible. I looked on the [DoIT page about it]([url link] which seems to say that the reason why we aren't eligible is because of Madison's calendar/e-mail system.  Why is this the case?

I've heard this is one of the easier advanced CS classes, or at least as easy as advanced CS classes get. Is there only homework or programming projects as well? I've looked at some of the previous semesters' class pages and they have mentioned no projects, but I definitely remember a senior on my floor working on a CS 540 project just last fall.

I've taken CS 367 and Math 234. CS 576, Intro to Bioinformatics seems interesting...    I would definitely take it, but I think it's not so very interesting. I am not sure what the grade distribution is for grad students, so I wouldn't know a ton about how much it is for grad students.        I am NOT an elective student    Thanks!\n",

You lead an afterschool club for 5-6th grade aged kids and teach them scratch as well do some hands on teaching. I'm pretty sure Andrea Arpacci-Dusseau will be back fall semester to run it again (rather than the grad students this year). EDIT: Also the UPL will be having a discussion on cs classes march 19th.
