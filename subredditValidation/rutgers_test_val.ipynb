I did not know that bio 1 and chem 1 should be taken together, now i will be offseason in my classes. Should i take chem 2 in the summer and get back on track for Orgo 1 in the fall or should i just take chem 2 in the fall? Is there anything wrong with taken offseason classes, any pros/cons such as delaying the MCAT? . I am worried that i am behind on my schedule, please give me any advice that seems beneficial. <eos> \n",

More importantly, [our traffic is beginning to slow]([url link] As finals end and spring break begins this subreddit is going to start feeling quite lonely.  ----------------------------  Last semester I (and a few other redditors) posted [some fliers]([url link] around campus. It was a bit sloppy, we weren't able to cover every campus, and the fliers got taken (ripped?) down within a couple days. This coming semester I hope to put a little more effort into getting the word out. So far, these are some ideas I have: * More fliers, more often, and more organized (to cover all campuses) * An ad in The Targum or The Medium (this might required donations) * Encouraging subscribers to post on Facebook, tell their friends, etc. The purpose of this thread to to encourage you guys to suggest improvements and new ideas to help spread the word about our community around campus. What else can we do to gain more subscribers? <eos> \n",

Any suggestions? I mean $11 isn't a lot, but every little bit helps. Thank you!  *Update*- I checked this morning after letting it go for 10 hours and PIRG was removed after my previous attempts. Give it a few hours and hopefully yours will get taken off too. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The way I see it is their are 5 avenues: 1. Class- I've found this to be hit or miss because some people don't want to talk during lecture or already have friends outside of the class 2. Clubs- This could lead to either a coworker relationship or maybe friendship 3. Study Groups-Have not tried this one yet 4. Mutual Friends- Don't have too many so I'm shit out of luck 5. Talking to random stangers on campus- The probability of this working is low. I'm curious what has worked for other commuters cause I'm struggling to make friends. <eos> \n",

I'm looking at available minors  the entrepreneurship one catches my eye.

A few times already, I have received the email from course sniper, dropped my class at that time, and then went to add the econ class in a matter of 60 SECONDS OR LESS, and it says the course is closed. Absolutely insane, it is like people have bots registering them for the class when it opens. Anyone have any tips for me, or should I just keep trying until it works? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> How much does 211 vary with different professors. In 112, since Sesh coordinated the course, every class went by the same textbook, syllabus, assignments, problem sets, and exams. Obviously 211 isn't coordinated by someone but I want to know how the course differs between different professors? Besides different teaching/lecturing styles, are the assignments/exams consistent throughout every class? Lastly, are their problem sets/other homeworks in 211 because I want to know if the recitations are mandatory. Any feedback is appreciated.

            "<bos> I'm having an issue with a banquet hall that is threatening to take me to court over a breach of contract. The story is kind of long but basically, I signed a contract to book a hall there three weeks n advance, but when my dad got laid off, I had to cancel the party because we could no longer pay for it. They asked that I pay in cash, so I didn't put down a deposit. We discussed that I would pay the deposit in the next couple of days, but after my dad got laid off, I never paid the deposit. I told them I was no longer interested, and they threatened to charge 50% to m credit card (I signed a credit card authorization form) the card got denied when they tried to charge it, and they just sent me an email threatening to pursue legal action if I don't pay the 50 percent....about $640. I read over the contract, and there is a clear statement that says in case of cancellation, I must pay 50%, but there is also another statement that says that the contract is valid when signed and when the deposit is paid. I understood that since I never paid the deposit, the contract was never valid. Anyway, that's the story, and now I would like to seek some legal advice to see where I stand.  Does anyone know a resource for rutgers students or low income students tat could provide me with legal advice? I know 640 seems like a small amount, but it's a big deal to me. <eos> \n",

Their falafel has a *very* distinct taste that none of the other restaurants have for their falafel sandwichs.  what is the hype with this place? Insanly high ratings on google and yelp. What the hell am I missing out here. Fucking knights express and ru hungrys falafel/sharwarma/platters taste 100x better and they dont even specialize in that  Typing this as I suffer and try to finish a 12 dollar platter from there which I loaded with white sauce cause I thought it was good <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Any recommendations for professors? The one's currently listed are; Perri, Vogelmann, Brownstone, and Kevin Johns. I sat in John's class for the first day of class this fall and when he went over the structure, I THINK I remember him saying he doesn't have a big group project (unlike the other professors for this class) and the class has 3 papers that were in total worth 50-60% of our final grade. Personally, this no group project thing is pretty great, but I'd like to verify if my memory is correct or not lol. Anyway, I ended up not taking the class this semester because it couldn't work with my schedule, but I am registered for it Spring semester with Johns, and was wondering if I should stick with this section or aim for another another section. Or maybe even try to take this class in the winter with Kenan Guler, if anyone has any experience with him they'd be willing to share? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm taking an online course through the PoliSci MA program and the professor is a part-time lecturer who has only been posting blog posts and Youtube videos as assignments, where we write a response to the former and then write a forum post for the latter. There was been no formal structure and he has completely disregarded the syllabus. The culmination of the course is a 30-page research paper, which is more or less the length of an undergraduate thesis to be completed in five weeks. He has been largely unresponsive and expects us to make two research contributions in our paper. As a PTL, is he qualified/able to be assigning thesis-level work to be completed over the course of five weeks? He even calls it a \"crash course,\" so I'm unsure how quality research is supposed to be done here. Just seeking other perspectives on this. <eos> \n",

Are there people currently big in data scraping, visualization, analysis? Would love to network and see how we can work together on this project I am envisioning.  ------------- EDIT: Hi guys - got some great support on this, super exciting - thank you so much for your interest! I have created a Discord server for us, even though for now it may be informal, I think this could serve really well for early forms of communication and networking. I am not so sure if I'll have the time as a senior to form this group, but I believe forming a community around this would be a fantastic starting point. The discord invitation link: [url link] ..

I'm looking to join a rescue squad (EMS) in the area as a volunteer--I'm not certified yet, ideally I'd join a squad that allows their volunteers to ride while still taking the EMT course and such.

            "<bos> It was announced today by Gov. Christie that he plans to sign an executive order merging together the UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, UMDNJ School of Public Health, and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey with Rutgers University. I just escaped the RU screw for UMDNJ and it looks like I will be back on the banks soon. For those interested, this is what UMDNJ released to the press: \"In view of the UMDNJ Advisory Committee report released today, which is described as an interim report, we all need to carefully examine and understand the implications of the findings and recommendations for the entire UMDNJ community and its mission, as well as the broader medical and health care education and delivery system in New Jersey. Thus, we will take time to reflect on the recommendations and develop a response for the Advisory Committee. We will work collaboratively to ensure that we meet our responsibility to provide state-of-the-art care to patients throughout our statewide footprint; that best-in-class education is not disrupted and continues to be afforded to students in the health professions; and that cutting-edge research continues to advance the art and science of health care delivery. Within that framework we will build on the legacy of excellence in these three arenas that has been the collective contribution of our employees, students, patients and communities. We commit to vigorously promoting the mission of UMDNJ within whatever structural context is ultimately determined to be most consonant with that outcome. We will continue to work with the many stakeholders who are critical to that achievement. \"This Board recognizes that this interim report, and the process that continues forward, will be the subject of much dialogue among students, faculty, employees, alumni, elected officials and the public at large. As that dialogue ensues, we pledge to not only continue to participate fully and constructively but to remain steadfast in our pursuit of educational, research and health care excellence.\" Tl;dr: UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Public Health and the Cancer Institute of NJ may soon become a part of Rutgers and Gov. Christie intends to sign an executive order making it so. <eos> \n",

I'm going to be a freshman as an undecided (major) student.  I've never truly been amazing at STEM, so one of my most likely majors will be business-related. That said, should I take Calc 135, or 151? I am currently in SAS to \"explore\" my options, but will transfer to RBS if I make the decision. Thank you very much! ----- Edit: I do realize that Calc151 would better prepare you for future courses, but under what circumstance would I take Calc152? Is Calc152 basically for people with math majors? As stated, i am undeclared in major, not much affinity for STEM.  Can you go, if needed: CALC 135 151 152 251? or CALC 135 136 250?

Throughout the semester I have literally been unable to go to class and the pain was debilitating. I have the doctor's notes to prove this. However I did miss a lot of class and a few exams. The only professor I am having trouble with is calc 152. They haven't given me any indication of either dropping an exam or taking it or really anything. Also my quiz grade is somewhere in the 20's. I know the material but is there anything I could do to still pass the class? I've talked to the student dean but I'm still freaking out.I need to pass this class.

            "<bos> I came to Rutgers directly from high school in the fall of 2015 (supposed to be class of 2019). I got to say, I wasn't expected my life to turn out this way. I was suffering from depression and socail anxiety from the beginning I entered. Despite being here for two year I haven't been to a single party or event and made very few friends. It severely affected my academics, as I barely did my homework and skipped weeks of lectures. This all culminated to me getting academically suspended for the 2017-2018 year which was supposed to be my junior year(luckily I got readmitted for summer). A good chunk of the very few friends I had ghosted me. Despite all of this, I was able to turn some things around. I got a 3.6 for a semester at Middlesex and have become more confident in myself when it come socializing. My question is if it possible for me to make things better when I come back this summer? Is it possible for me to have good set of friends (from the class of 2019) and actually have a good a college experience? Is there anything I can do right now about it? Is it too late? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I go to rutgers and part-time deliver for this app called crunch button. Basically it allows you to get food from places like chipotle, Taco Bell, and Starbucks delivered anywhere on campus. Right now it's pretty underutilized at rutgers, and I thought some of you guys might be interested. It's pretty sweet for like a rainy day or lazy Sunday. Anyway, just trying to get the word out there since I don't think many people have heard about it and it's pretty unique/helpful. If you do ever decide to use crunch button this code will give you $3 off: eba262zvc. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all! I'm an incoming transfer student (Communication major) with a few questions that I'm hoping you guys might be able to answer. * **Picking a Minor.** I'm stuck between six options: Criminology; Digital Communication, Information, and Media; French; Social Justice; Sociology; and Theater. All six interest me and I'm having a tough time narrowing them down. **Is anyone currently minoring or has anyone recently minored in any of the six?** If so, which one? How do you like it? What don't you like about it? Favorite/least favorite classes? How many classes within the minor have required you to write a paper? (I'm a perfectionist with some intense writing anxiety; while I can produce a damn good paper, the writing process itself is very stressful and time-consuming for me and I'd like to try to avoid papers as much as I can. I understand that it is college and I can't completely run away from papers, but I'd like to try to take the \"road less written,\" if you will.) * **Scheduling.** I'd like to plan my fall schedule in advance so that I won't feel lost and rushed when I register for classes on STAR Day. **Where can I go to see what classes (and their days, times, instructors, etc.) are being offered this fall?** * **Any Suggestions?** Do you have any suggestions or advice for STAR Day, being a transfer student, being new to Rutgers, the bus system, or literally anything else? Thanks in advance for any and all answers, suggestions, or advice you can give! <eos> \n",

I understand the topics, I just didn't prepare at all. Is there any hope to bring my grade back up? I'm going to definitely work harder, I just feel like shit right now, and am terrified that my grade can't be brought up. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, so i'm a new transfer student and for some reason the housing assignments put me in a single room on college ave. On the housing application I requested college ave but i listed single room as least preferred so idk why they put me there. Either way, I do not like my dorm/building. My entire floor is anti-social upperclassmen in singles and the rest of the building is Freshman but they all hang out with each other and i nvr see them. So i was thinking about trying to go to the Douglass dorms/housing. But i want to know first, what is it like living there? Are the girls cliquey/bitchy? IS there diversity on douglass? One of my big complaints is there are barely any black people on college ave (mostly whites and asians), so i want a place with more diversity. Also, is it hard to switch into the douglass community? And as a transfer student would it be hard making friends there, especially if i request moving into a single room? (I kinda like singles now even though i didn't request it before). Any information/advice is welcome! <eos> \n",

I had a friend who took it for june but backed out on me before I could have the time to really find someone. :/ Please message me if anyone is interested or knows anyone who might want it! I just cant afford rent for July and August. Rent is super cheap by the way at $420 a month. I just can't do it while not living there. I can provide pics if you message me. It's on college ave, 10 mins from Scott hall on Hamilton street, right across from Ale n wich. Message me for details. :)  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So next year (senior year) I only have to take 24 credits. I could take 12 and 12, but I am considering taking 15 and 9 instead. I'm not sure if I was doing the math correctly but I see full time tuition is $10,718. That price would be the same regardless of if I take 12 or 15 credits, right? It also says that part time status is $345 per credit hour. So instead, I would be paying $3,105 in tuiton for the second semester. Does anybody have any experience in taking classes part-time? It almost seems too good to be true if I can save $7000. Do I have different requirements or restrictions on what I can/can't do as a part-time student? I also live off-campus so I do not need full-time status for housing. Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm transferring from a community college and have star day on the 8th of June. So I need to figure out when I'm gonna be going to the gym so I can schedule my classes around that.  I was wondering when everyone else does the gym so I can get an idea of when I should go. I've been going right when I wake up (about 9 AM) but I figure that in order to eat something before going to the gym while I'm at Rutgers I'd have to go to the dining hall first and you wouldn't go there to just eat a quick snack before the gym. So I'd have to do fasted workouts in the morning. I'm not sure what to do. I figure night time workouts aren't that horrible or even mid day ones. I just don't know if I'll end up sitting around all day thinking about getting my workout in if I don't get it over with at the start of the day. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm leaving the country for a few months and looking to sublet my room. My lease ends May 30th and you can move in as early as Dec 22nd. Room for rent in a three bedroom house. $488/month. The medium size kitchen has a dishwasher, plenty of counter and fridge space. We have a large, furnished living room. There is plenty of storage space between the basement and attic. In the basement is a washer and dryer that we share with our three downstairs neighbors. The house is a short, ten minute walk from downtown New Brunswick and the train station. We located in a quiet neighborhood with driveway parking, in addition to ample street parking. Bills are usually around 100/month in the winter, a bit less in the summer. Roomates are females in their late twenties, recent graduates of Rutgers, one is working there. If you're interested or know someone who is send me a PM! <eos> \n",

I would be more than interested to start a club if anyone else with the same interests would be willing to help. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> **TL;DR:** If you have zero experience with the Japanese language but would like to begin learning, inbox me to express your interest. **Hi guys!** I'm a student at RU currently studying Japanese, and I'm creating a [Meetup]([url link] group meant only for *beginners*, meaning those who've never taken Japanese 101 or have equivalent knowledge. My plan is to meet every Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Alexander Library (reserved room) on College Ave. I'm creating this group knowing that there are many who want to learn the Japanese language; but I also realize that many don't have the time, means, or resources to accomplish that goal.  **What you will learn:** • Japanese writing systems (hiragana, katakana, and some kanji) • Common phrases, conversational skills, vocabulary, and reading • Culture points **What to Expect:** • 1-2-hours of direct, friendly instruction • In-class and take-home handouts to assist in learning • Speaking and writing in every class  **About me:** I'm a Japanese 102 student with teaching experience. Though my goal is to help others learn, I'm also doing this to enhance my own understanding of Japanese. Though I am a mere 102 student, I feel I have a strong grasp of the basics; however, it's because I'm just a 102 that I'm only reaching out to beginners. Also note that you can practice Japanese at the Japanese Conversation Club (JCC).  If interested, please inbox me. Important Note: I will *not* go ahead with this idea unless (or until) I have at least four RSVPs. Thank you. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So my friend goes to NJMS, which is a top medical school in New Jersey, where students need to be top 10% of the class with a 1500/4.5 GPA+. He says pharmacy is a garbage major, and talked to the local Stop  Shop (hiring pharmacists --- I'm becoming a pharmacy technician there for senior year, and said it was bad, according to them.) He said it's bad, even if it's good like Ernesto school of pharmacy which is ranked #30. Is pharmacy really dying, or is he just scaring me? I know it's not like a TERRIBLE program, since it's really competitive, but my friend seems to be talking down to me on it, and discouraging it. Is there reason for him to be, or is he just being extra?  Granted I can qualify for BS/DO programs, but I think pharmacy would suit me more. What are your opinions on RU pharmacy, or pharmacy in general?  \\---  Thanks. Have a great day! <eos> \n",

I'm under the impression that they might be only for faculty use or whatever. Alternatively, can I use any of the post offices to send a UPS package? (UPS pre-paid shipping label).

My ethernet cable doesn't seem to work too well anymore now (either worse than wireless or just completely cut off) and I get cut off from RUWireless_secure very frequently - I might have to relogin from 2~6 times per hour for it as it doesn't reconnect automatically. I've never had this problem before and I've tried refreshing my laptop too.  Any idea as to why this is happening? <eos> \n",

Therefore, I should still be a full time student, however, my housing bill was suddenly removed from my term bill, although I still have access to my dorm. I called the housing services and they said I was still registered and that they still see charges for my account. When I called student accounting, they told me they would get back to me no later than Monday, which I think is absolute horseshit. My term bill was originally due mid-August, but was suddenly changed to 9/9.  Did anyone else ever have this? And what should I do? I was just about to set up my payment plan when this happened. <eos> \n",

For some reason, I couldn't register for prof James because it required a SPN, although I did it through webreg 3 seconds after the senior dropped the class.  I know RBS doesn't give SPNs, but is this it? Is there really no other way for me to take Intro to SC next sem? I'm really behind the business core classes.

At first I was looking at multiple places off campus but I decided that not knowing the area and the school at all, it's probably best for me to live on campus first. I recently just send in my application I seriously need a single bedroom. I told myself if I don't get a single bedroom then I'll just go off campus but I recently find out that we won't know our housing assignment until august! That will be way too late for me if I don't get a single bedroom. Do you guys know what is the chances of me getting a single bedroom as a transfer? Should I just give up on on campus housing and looking for off campus? and do you think it's better for new student to stay on campus or it doesn't matter? Thank you!  <eos> \n",

Should I receive acceptance from Newark's School of Criminal Justice too, which campus is a better program for criminal justice? I hear that NB is academically \"better\" but Newark has an entire building for law and Justice. I'm 23 and not looking to party too hard, mostly just wanting the best program for CJ. I'm transferring from a small town in the Chicago suburbs, Penn State Abington (should I be accepted) and Rutgers are my top picks. NB vs Newark for CJ? Or even Penn Abington vs Rutgers for CJ if you have a thought on that. Just trying to get my shit straight for a big decision. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For one of my classes, I handed in a term paper that was submitted through Sakai and went through the Turnitin program to verify similarity with online sources. I got a Turnitin error through sakai where it wouldn't rate my paper's similarity percentage, so I emailed my paper to my Professor. Professor says she refuses to grade anything not sent through Turnitin - fine. I try submitting the paper a variety of different ways and failed, so finally she somehow to submitted it through what she said was a \"backdoor\" of Turnitin. I used a lot of quotes in my paper, and my similarity came up as 34% (although they were properly cited). Professor asked me to revise my paper and the Turnitin percentage must be 15% or less to not receive a point deduction. I revised my paper, removed all quotes to try to avoid any problems with Turnitin, and emailed it to her after she said she would rerun it through Turnitin and let me know the percentage. She never emailed me back, and finally I get a notification through Sakai that I received my grade back - 15 points were deducted from my paper grade with the explanation that she was \"Unable to verify similarity percentage.\" I emailed her asking what happened, because she assured me she would run it through Turnitin on her end since I was unable to. She replied:  \"I ran the final copy through my \"back door\" to Turnitin (not the through the class Sakai site).... and the similarity index is 85%.... However, it is impossible to tell how much of that is due to the similarity to your first submission...which the sakai help desk submitted through THEIR back door.... but it all goes into the same data base.\" So I received a 15 point deduction because Turnitin may have related my paper to... my own paper. Instead of a 90, I received a 75. Should I bother appealing this? My grade in the class is a B+, would have been an A without this point deduction. I'm not upset about my final grade necessarily, just about the fact that I received a major point deduction for what may have been just a similarity to my own first submission. What would you do in this situation? I'm wondering if it's worth making a big deal over. tl;dr: Turnitin said my paper was too similar to other sources. I resubmitted a revised draft which received a higher similarity percentage. Professor isn't sure if new higher Turnitin similarity is relating my revised paper to my own original draft - deducted 15 points from my paper grade. WWYD? <eos> \n",

I didn't do well on the first midterm either, I got a 43. I wanted to ask if there is any way to get a C in the class with these grades? I've studied so hard for each of them but I couldn't even pass them. Should I take the F and retake it next semester? Or should I depend on the final?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I transferred to rutgers this fall and it sucks. It's been so hard making friends in my dorm - I live on Douglass in all female housing, and no one ever leaves their rooms. I managed to make friends with two other people, and we want to get an apartment next year. But I'm scared that's too isolated for me - I still want more of that community feel.  So I was thinking of living in dorms next year again. I'd want college ave housing definitely, and not in a freshmen dorm. Does college ave have dorms where it's mostly upperclassmen, or at least sophomore +? Are they social, open? Would it be weird to live there as a junior? Would reverse seniority points not let me live there anyway?  I'd just really like to have more friends, it's getting depressing. And I definitely plan on joining some type of Greek life next semester.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello Everyone! A few months back at the end of last semester, I made [this post]([url link] on /r/rutgers explaining my current situation of loneliness and letting myself get very isolated and depressed. I’m doing okay now, I’m feeling mostly the same but seeing more reason to believe things might be able to get better for myself, I don’t really know. Anyway, as I said in my original post, I want to try to see if I can turn things around for myself in my last year here, and one way to potentially do that is through clubs. Only problem is of course I’m already a senior, making it a bit of an awkward place to start. Basically what I’m asking is if it’s realistic to make strong connections and relationships with people through clubs this late in the game (I’m sure the answer is yes, but I guess I’d just like to hear reassurance or success stories if anyone has them) and if I might be able to have the experiences I was hoping to have in just one year. Thanks. <eos> \n",

I know that all my first choices might not end up being in my final schedule, but I still really want to make changes. I emailed SAS advising and they told me I can only make changes during add/drop week. How does this work? If I want to add or drop a class, could I do it and replace it before attending the class? And is this done through Sakai or another RU online thing?  What were your experiences with add/drop? FYI: I’m trying to add Intermediate Spanish I (or maybe Elementary Korean), Global East Asia, and maybe Calc 135. Is it usually difficult to try to add these courses? <eos> \n",

I was looking at meal plan rates (because I honestly miss the dining hall), and it's so much more expensive than I remember it being. However, there are guest prices. Are those prices if you run out of guest swipes and still want to bring a guest, or can I (without having a meal plan at all) show up (with my ID of course) and just pay the $12 to eat? I'd only be eating lunch and I'm really sick of eating fast food (I live an hour and a half commute away and I'm on campus the entire day when I have class so I can't eat lunch at home, but a dining hall buffet for lunch would get me through the day, so I could care less that I'm paying $4 more than I would be for fast food.) tl;dr: Can I just pay for individual meals at the door without a meal plan? <eos> \n",

I had issues concentrating, lack of motivation, severe mood swing, anxiety attacks, rushing thoughts. These things impacted me from getting 2.75 this summer.

            "<bos> I'm in an incoming sophomore at RBS NB. When i was a freshman, i received a good fin aid packet. In 2015, my family income increased overall, however in dec 2015, my mom got laid off. My dad is full time and mom is receiving unemployment benefits (around 1/5 of her actual income) at the moment. I haven't gotten my financial aid letter for 2016-2017 yet, but i did see my NJ TAG and it has dropped significantly (probably because the income was higher in 2015 than in 2014). I called HESSA, they said to call Rutgers. I called Rutgers today and the representative (who was very rude) said submit this form and there's a 50/50 chance of you receiving additional aid. She didn't tell me anything else. I'm worried, mom not working means a huge change in income, and my parents legit have no savings right now, I can take out loans but going off from last year's packet, even if I did take out all loans, I would have still had to pay a couple grand out of pocket.

Their tactics include coming straight up to you, grabbing a hold of you, basic intimidation to get you to buy their stupid airheads for their drug fund.

I said no and then the taller one said \"buy one\" forcefully grabbing my arm. His grip wasn't too strong so I got loose and I fking booked it into Tillet.

I'm looking to transfer out of SAS after finishing my mathematics requirements (for the uninitiated, this goes up to Calc II and I was placed into Precalc). So far my schedule for this semester is: Chinese 201, Precalculus 115, Music 103, Gen Physics 203, Gen Physics (Lab) 205, and a Byrne. (I tested out of Expos with AP credit.) Next semester I'm looking at Chem I, Intro to Experimentation, MATLAB, Calc I, and Statics. I'll take Calc II over the summer. Would this be fitting for someone looking into an ECE major? I have a gut feeling I should maybe drop some courses and replace them this semester with a lineup similar (i.e. Intro to Computers for Engineers, Gen Chem, etc) to a first-year engineering student's courseload, but I figured I'd ask here first.  Update: Specified that the above was my current semester and added in my plans for next semester. <eos> \n",

Right now this is what my fall semester looks like: Fundamentals of Neurobio, Basic stat for research, Physics, Physics lab, Elementary German, some english class or seminar I don't remember. I'm not taking orgo because I already took it this past summer. I'm mostly worried because physics in my high school was complete crap so I literally don't have a grasp on the subject. Labs also stress me out so there's that. As for neurobio I hear mixed reviews. I don't have Miniere for stat but Benjamin. I hear he's alright.  I'm just wondering if this is way too much.

On Easton Ave some of the pizza places would clear out their stock real late at night by knocking all slices down to a dollar a piece. Was quite a wonderful treat.  It's been over a decade since I have been down there or in any of the student centers, do deals like that still exist anywhere? <eos> \n",

I'm only taking 15 credits though, so dropping it will send me lower than I can do to stay a full-time student. Are there any relatively straightforward minicourses I can add to keep me above 12? I've heard they aren't too difficult, but I looked at a few and Topics in American Studies: Arts Adventure seems like a lot of work, going by the course description. I really don't think I can handle taking Chem for much longer... <eos> \n",

Now that I am in Rutgers, I can not register for any Economics classes, even the electives. It will be a full year before I am finished with my pre-requisites. What do I do? I don't want to spend money on an entire year at Rutgers just to take two pre-requisite classes. And I can't take any minors worth while either as they typically include math pre requisites. I do not need to take any Gen-Ed classes due to my Associates from Bergen. Am I screwed? I asked the advisor if I should just go back to bergen to finish the pre-requisites instead and she said that if I did that Rutgers would not accept it due to me already having been accepted and registered for Rutgers.  <eos> \n",

I know this is pretty late, but I had planned to take the train this semester as my primary option of commute. Thinking that this might actually be a good alternative now. All of my classes are on Busch, so I guess I would want a permit there, but after reading through the DOTS information here: [url link] it seems like there aren't any left on Busch. Is there a good chance I can get one by putting myself on the wait list or should I just get a Zone L pass (which I **think** is Livingston only)? Thanks for any help :) <eos> \n",

If I can't get any aid, should I transfer to a different school for more aid?

The professor (Sontag) did not upload/release individual exam scores and only inputted our final grades. A few students asked if they could get their scores but no response from the professor. I am still curious about my exam grade and might email him directly even though it's kind of late. But, are professors required to release final exam scores? I don't see any reason not to unless the professor is lazy or doesn't care since the semester is over. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks. <eos> \n",

I feel like I’m at a point in my life where social anxiety is holding me back from so much! It’s more than just shyness or being an introvert. At my internship I want to talk and I feel like I’m always on the verge of saying something but I physically can’t for worry of sounding stupid or embarrassing myself or being annoying. I really want to overcome this and grow as a person. So if you know of anyone in the area or surrounding please let me know! Thanks!  <eos> \n",

Every other department seems to post the courses with professors before registration, some as early as the beginning of October.

I never took it in high school. Edit: Just to add I'm an Engineering Major. I'm honestly pretty worried because Analytical Physics is a first year class and I'm doing terrible in it.

He needs patients for his dental licensing exam on Saturday, March 5th, 2016 at 110 Bergen Street in Newark, NJ (the dental school). You will be PAID to have your fillings or deep cleaning done! It doesn't matter if you have insurance or you don't, you will be PAID for your fillings or deep cleaning! Please reach out to me if you or anyone else you know are interested! It's very important that he gets the patients he needs, which unfortunately he does not have as of right now. Please help spread the word.

            "<bos> As the title says, I did poorly on my first CS Midterm. I got a 63/100, and I thought that I would at least get better than that. The average of the midterm is an 83. But I've gotten all 100's on my homework and for my recitation grade as well. Right now, I'm currently failing Calc 151. On Sakai, it says I have 49/100. I think the average is a 53, and, apparently, they gave us 10 extra points on our Calc Midterm. So I basically have a 39/100. I'm not sure if the average includes the 10 extra points. I've finished all the WebAssigns except for one and the Workshops aren't looking too good either. How bad is it looking for me right now? I'm pretty worried for the upcoming midterms that are coming in a couple of weeks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have an exam next week in this class and I feel like Professor Cabrera has spent all of the class time going through R and SAS functions without the class actually learning anything. Now he's told us to refer to the sample questions he posted on sakai without any answers, and hasn't given us any information as to the layout/depth of the exam.  Has anyone taken this class with Cabrera and remember how the midterm was? I can teach myself based off of the sample questions but am unsure of the layout of the exam itself. Any help? <eos> \n",

Then there's a standard influx of upperclassmen and alumni that say they didn't do so well, but they survived. Let's just start this one large post of our failures, and successes after. I'm sure for all the students washing their misery in a few Pabsts right now, there were tons of people in the same boat as you were. <eos> \n",

I'm looking for any opportunities to get experience for research and development during the school year, and so was wondering what other kind of resources or places I might look? So far I tried talking to some professors that do research in the medical field, and the Busch-Livingston health center to be a volunteer. Aresty applications open during March, and so I need help finding one for the upcoming fall as I haven't had much luck even with sending out many applications. **On a side note**, I was also wondering how I might overcome my previously poor grades? I was a horrible student in my freshman and sophomore years, but I really got the hang of school this year and even got a 4.0 this past semester. A lot of places have GPA requirements, but I feel if they saw how much I've improved over a short period of time they might reconsider. Thank you for reading! <eos> \n",

Last year I was able to buy ($165) as soon as they were available, but this time the money went to a vet visit for my dog.  So question is do you think I will be okay getting a permit on 9/1?

That said, there will be polling locations at the LSC and the BCC, as well as the Lincoln School on Bartlett St. Here's the source: [url link] If you are registered in New Brunswick or Piscataway, you can find out where your polling location is here: [url link] If you're registered in the city New Brunswick, you should still go to your assigned polling location. There is a question on the ballot - Municipal Question 1 - that allows for the New Brunswick school board to be democratically elected rather than be appointed by Mayor Cahill, New Brunswick's super corrupt mayor who has been in office for 22 years. Vote YES on Municipal Question 1 to end political patronage in New Brunswick schools! [url link] Also, REALLY IMPORTANT THING! PLEASE vote YES on State Question 1 - the Building Our Future Bond Act! What this means is that the state will open up $750 mil in state bonds, and the revenues generated will be going towards building CLASSROOM BUILDINGS and RESEARCH FACILITIES in all the public colleges in New Jersey with almost no dent to the NJ taxpayer's pocket. Since Rutgers is a research institution, we'll be getting a huge chunk of that, which is sweet. For more info, go here: [url link]  See you at the polls~ <eos> \n",

I'm an RA for a project that I really am not interested in (my fault for doing it in the first place), and barely have anything to show for the past few months. At this point, I doubt I'll have much to show/talk about at the symposium. So, any advice on how to get through it would be awesome!

Also, a little off topic, but I'm going to be a senior next year with 4 seniority points, but I have one of the worst lotto numbers ever (10,762 UGHGHGH). I'm trying desperately to get an apartment, but I have a severe lack of friends at this school. It would be my dream to live in the Livi apartments, but with my lotto number, I'd be lucky if I got any apartment at all. I'm shooting for Silvers on Busch if I can find enough people, but if not, I'm thinking a single or something would do fine.  What are my chances for either an apartment or a single? My lotto number last year was fantastic, but I didn't need it since I was in a Living Learning community this year. Rumor has it the LLC isn't even going to be a thing next year, so I'm worried about not having good housing my senior year.  <eos> \n",

At the time I sent in my application I was convinced they were one and the same (silly me), but after deciding to make a more thorough search online I now know that this is NOT the case.  I feel quite silly, and a little bummed out for making this error and not even have it occur to me that some clarification should have been made with my guidance counselor beforehand, and asking for advice now isn't possible because she will be out for the next few days.  They made it pretty clear that changes can't be made after the application is submitted, so I am wondering about how my mistake will look to admissions officers.

I had one FinAid rep tell me they definitely go out on the 25th (which is today), and then another FinAid rep told me they go out two weeks later, and then yet another FinAid rep told me they go out at different times based on...well, something that seemed random and arbitrary. Anyway...students, former students, especially former grad students...do you recall when, in relation to the start of the semester, you got your disbursement so that you could go get books and stuff? If it really isn't for two weeks, then that means classes will have been going for a week before I'm able to get books (would that count as the RU Screw?).

Math seems like the obvious general choice, but what other options does Rutgers have that you would suggest? <eos> \n",

Basically pretty sheltered. Does anyone go trick or treating around here or know if there's anything chill to do?

He does not respond to emails, and calling the number listed on the webpage leads to message saying the number is not operational. Background is that he is supposed to be co-examining a thesis by a mature student in our department, but has been sitting on it for 6 months, and all attempts to contact him have failed. We are not in the US, so email is the primary means of contact. Plus we have had some changes in senior faculty, and the faculty member who originally contacted this guy is now retired, and on holiday in Mauritius. This whole thing has dragged on for a fair bit now. All I need is:  * confirmation that he exists * he is alive and still at Rutgers * and if possible, a working contact number Thanks a lot! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi guys, just wondering, but I know that for SAS honors are considered: 3.5 - 3.699 Cum Laude 3.7 - 3.849 - Magna Cum Laude 3.850 - 4.00 - Summa Cum Laude The commencement site says that any SAS student who achieves any of these honors is given a special gold cord for their commencement. However in some pictures I noticed of my friends they were wearing actual gold sashes that says \"Honors\" on it. Is this given to the SAS students who have achieved honors or is it for students who are IN the actual SAS Honors school? Just wanted some clarification. Thanks! :D <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I just transferred to Rutgers New Brunswick. I'm a CS major. I'm junior status. My dorm is among freshmen. I'm trying to find a group of friends, but it's kind of difficult. I saw a similar post like this about \"social anxiety\" on here, but I'm not here to complain. I know to meet new friends you have to take initiative and stuff.  I've only been here a few days I know, I guess I'm rather impatient. I just want to get involved in things and meet new people, and hopefully some of those people turn out to be good friends.  If you would like to give me any suggestions in general, please do so.  If you think you may want to be friends with me, here are my interests: Programming. Video games. Sports (not serious sports, like occasional basket ball or swimming or anything really, for enjoyment as well as exercise). Also, friend(s) to weight lift with me so i have an incentive to do it (other wise I probably will rarely do it ha). Anything fun/interesting I would do really. I don't smoke or do drugs, or alcohol. Although I am open to drinking occasionally, but it would be new to me. Sorry for the long post. I signed up for the mailing list for a general CS and a gamedev club. Does anyone know if they are still alive or active, or when they will next meet? No emails from them yet. <eos> \n",

Are there any classes in the MSIS major that involve R or SQL? I really would love to have some type of data analytics job, and am not sure whether it matters what major you have from RBS. I could teach myself R or SQL if needed. I am not sure if I should stick with Accounting, or switch to MSIS. I believe a similar major is MIS at RBS New Brunswick <eos> \n",

I know a lot of people have issues bringing friends or others to raves, as there tends to be some sort of enigma around the EDM community, and a lot of people end up going alone or not at all.

Specifically I'm looking on streets like Senior, Sicard, Bartlett, etc. And I already have a few nice places in mind, mostly 3-4 bedroom places. I study a lot, read, draw, work out, play video games, party most weekends ( though I don't usually have parties at my own place ).  I'm a girl but I don't care if I live with guys or girls. I'm more used to living with boys due to similar interests, but I'm down for whatever.  PM me to get each other's Facebook info!  <eos> \n",

I know both the major and minor at Rutgers is easier than others, but should I focus my efforts on a different minor? I considered CS but I'm not trying to screw up my GPA cause I'm a shit programmer, but I plan to learn Python over this summer and hopefully continue to learn other languages. I considered economics too but its not really my interest. I don't want my career path to be as communication oriented as the major is seen as, and hope to gain a more technical position. I'm kind of lost and don't want to waste my time here or take a succession of useless classes. Please throw some ideas, thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I got a 74 on the first midterm, but the average was an 87. Someone told me STEM Classes might grade based on the performance of the class, so a 74 might be considered a \"fail\" because the average was so high. Standard Deviation was 12.  I'm just wondering if this theory holds true in classes and why teachers pull this kind of bullshit. I consider a 74 obviously not really good but that doesn't mean I'm terrible at computer science and I certainly don't deserve to fail the course because of it. Also, from previous posts about this topic from years ago the averages were way lower, in the 50s and 60s so does anyone know if they're making the course easier? I feel a lot of kids come from AP so they have experience whereas I'm completely new to coding. <eos> \n",

Has anyone here had experience transferring to the NB business school after one year? Also, I saw the Newark campus is still accepting applications for their business school. If I had only applied for the RBS NB, can I request to have my application considered for Newark? <eos> \n",
            "<bos>  Just ate my first Brower chicken at Brower Commons on College Ave and wtf? I feel like this chicken is not supposed to be hard. All my friends on other campuses tell me how easy it is to eat their chicken. I read all the dining hall menus so I figured I would get medium rare chicken at most and not get food poisoning. I’m just looking for some edible chicken. I took my first bite and was like WTF IS THIS? Literally none of it was cooked. I email Deba Dutta after and I nicely say that the chicken was super raw and whether I could get cooked chicken or something. I’m getting nicely cooked chicken at Busch and I get everything at Nielson and Livingston. I just don’t think the chicken was cooked at all since it didn’t taste like any chicken I’ve eaten before. He emails back just now like “the chicken is fine, chew more next time”. Fuck this guy. I ate chicken my senior year…it’s not supposed to be this hard. Also maybe if I didn’t have to buy the 210 meal plan, I would actually be able to buy some edible chicken and eat. So whatever now I’m just super angry and want to rant. I just need some edible chicken to get into my stomach, but I feel like I got a solid stomach ulcer. I know some friends who have had to run to the hospital because they ate Brower chicken twice and their stomach wouldn’t even let them shit it out. Is Deba Dutta really allowed to just keep you from eating edible chicken? I already feel like I’ve failed anyway. AW, BT, EH, JY, MW, RK <eos> \n",

Might have been the best burger I've ever had in my entire life... and I just had In 'N Out last month. It's a wee bit pricey. I think I paid $12 for a combo with chips and a drink.

Can anyone tell me about the communications school here (and if possible, compare it to TCNJ's)? I know a big difference between the colleges is the social life; I'm not really sure if I want a big atmosphere where I'm always meeting new people, or a tight knit and quiet community.

I have tried to ask random people in my class if they are interested in selling the code that came with their new iClicker. Clearly, I have not had any luck (most people act as if I'm trying to swindle them) and I would prefer not to pay the company directly for a code; especially when they so graciously supplied it to people who have no use for it. I would be grateful for a free code, but I am willing to negotiate if you want to sell it. To the moderators: I doubt I'm only one interested in buying/selling a reef code so is there any way we can make a place for others to do what I'm trying. I'm not very good with reddit so I don't know if this a horrible suggestion, but I just feel like its a good idea to give some money back to the students rather than dumping more into companies that make us spend more and more every year. Plus its a win-win because both students save $$$. <eos> \n",

I'm not required to file anything except a fafsa I think right? I know this was really stupid of me but it was so annoying that I gave up each time halfway through the because it was frustrating <eos> \n",
            "<bos> CS major looking to do a math minor wondering if it's worth taking math 477 in place of discrete 2 (CS 206). What are the general differences between the classes? Will I need to self-study material for upper CS-electives that require discrete in the future? If so, does discrete 2 delve into so many more CS topics than math 477 that it would be more practical to take discrete 2? For anyone who did choose to take 477 instead of discrete, did you end up struggling in algorithms and other electives or having to pick up concepts from discrete that weren't taught in 477? <eos> \n",

Got a D+ in Precalc and this I.T class as well, both of which I don't need for my major. Now before I apply in the winter, what should I do about my bad first semester?

Yesterday I walked into my room to find someone I had never met before playing Fortnite at MY desk, invited by my roommate to join the rotation of this dangerous substance. College Ave is deathly silent on Thursday nights due to its presence. All of Livingston resembles Quad 4. If you or a peer is showing signs of addiction to this software, inform someone.

I've got some time, so I haven't sent out applications yet. I'm very interested in Rutgers' Masters of Social Work program.  What is your major? What year are you? Have you completed any co-ops/internships/research? What courses/professors would you recommend others to TAKE? What hot spots near campus do you like to eat at? What is one thing you like about Rutgers? How could Rutgers be better? Will you go to graduate school, or get a job upon graduation (or have you found employment/been accepted into grad school)? How many hours a week do you browse reddit, how many hours a week do you spend on doing homework? Any additional comments? <eos> \n",

Therefore, if you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or have anything related to sniper.rutgers.io please feel free to PM me here or send an email to course.sniper.dev@gmail.com. Now that introductions are out of the way... I apologize for any inconvenience that you might have had with course sniper over the last few days. As I have just recently been handed the code I am gradually getting a handle on it so I am sorry for the growing pains. I realized that there were some issues in the past few days, such as the site not being up and people receiving the incorrect index number. I have corrected both of these issues and it should be functioning as expected. As for the index number issue, I accidentally set the incorrect semester but that should be fixed now. I will be more diligent in the future. Once again, please feel free to PM me or comment on this post if you have comments, questions, or concerns regarding course sniper. Thank you! <eos> \n",

I'm coming from a smaller school and Rutgers' campus size along with all the mysteries it holds is kind of intimidating, so if orientation provides any information that I can't just find on the sidebar I guess it would be worth going to.

I would like to work during the school year but I am also worried that doing both things will be too much for my plate. But I figured that maybe working 8-16 hours a week is not that bad. At least it is some money coming in. I live about 45 minutes from home so I will be making many trips to my house during the semester.

I already had an academic integrity violation in the past from using chegg, but since he was using it I figured it probably wasn't that big of a deal.

Located right next to Rutgers University (New Brunswick), we can clean anything and we work with many different schedules. If you're planning on moving into a rental for the year and you want to make sure its clean before you move in, send me a PM!  If you're involved in Greek life and you just finished another epic night of partying and have to deal with a sea of red cups, cigarette butts, vomit, and pizza boxes, just let us know! We're all students too, so we know how things can get. I also offer post-party deliveries of hangover drinks like Gatorade, Snapple, bottled water, and all manner of breakfast items. Again, PM to work out details! I am now taking reservations for move-in assistance. Beds, headboards, dressers, desks, boxes, boxes, and more boxes: whatever you need moved, we can help. We also do furniture assembly (for all the those Ikea fans) and trash removal, so when you're done with your cardboard boxes and packing paper, we can bag it and haul it. If you're interested in any of these services (or something else you think we may be able to help with), send me a PM. We are affordable, reliable, professional, and college students just like you. Edit(s): Style and addition of other delivery details. <eos> \n",

I currently live in the south and know almost nothing about Newark/NJ. I came to the experts to get some housing advice. I will be living by myself (no roommates) and am looking for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment/condo/townhome to rent in a very safe area. Distance is not a huge deal, I will have a car and reserved parking, so I'm ok with up to a 45 min commute each way. I also am interested in being in a more suburban setting if possible, but I realize it may not be. I have heard Montclair, NJ might be more suburban, but I really don't know.  Close parking, A/C, dishwasher, and in-unit washer/dryer are all must have features. I don't care about having a pool/gym/hot tub or anything like that.  I would like to keep the budget under $2000/mo including some of the utilities (not electric).  <eos> \n",

The cashier person said something about redirection or relocation if there's a home game this weekend (which I'm under the impression there is).  The permit is for parking in Lot 51 on Busch. If the car is parked, does it have to be moved to a different lot or be ticketed, or was that just a warning that the lot will be crowded if we decide to move the car during a busy hour for parking? <eos> \n",

Is one just harder? Or do they teach different things? 244 is Diff eq for engineering and physics and 252 is elementary diff eq. i guess it might make more sense to take 244 just because it includes for physics in the title, but like i said, both of them are acceptable for my major.

And I've decided to spend a few months writing an app about rutgers, a game where you go around and do rutgers things, like get fucked over by the bus system regularly, lose out on housing, pay 5s to not get any action at frat parties, visit the stabby dorm (metler i think), ect....  But I'm not exactly an artist so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in putting their name on an app with me when all is said and done, and split whatever profits may or may not come of it. If anyones interested, hit me up.  Note, if you don't know how to design top-down 2d maps, that's the simple part and I could teach you how to do that in say...20 minutes. The hard part is being elegant about it. I'm trying to make something really quality, and I just dont have the skill for graphic design/interior decorating haha <eos> \n",

I can't write essays anymore because I'm so burnt out--meaning Research in the Disciplines is a total no-go.

We'd love to have members of any experience level- I'm personally working on getting certified as an Instructor, and we have several members who are experienced shooters. Our club plans to participate in range trips once we can get logistics organized (we're currently in talk with sponsors, keep tuned!). These trips would be mainly for instructional purposes, but we'd definitely organize other events for fun! Our meetings at the school itself will not involve weapons on campus, but will be informational and social in nature. One of our members recommend I post my spiel here. The link is as follows for the Facebook group- feel free to join even if you have no firearms knowledge! As long as you're interested in learning more, that's what matters! :)  Feel free to ask me any questions under this post, via PM, or via Facebook Message!  [url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> According to the CS undergrad website [CS 425]([url link] is 'Computer Methods in Statistics' while the schedule of classes, webreg, and other Rutgers websites lists it as 'Brain-Inspired Computing'. I thought maybe they just renamed the class and didn't update webreg but there is a graduate version of brain-inspired computing called [CS 525]([url link] and its description seems totally different to that of the new computer methods in statistics one. Moreover the professor who teaches the grad version seems to be the same one teaching the undergrad version next semester (the one still titled Brain-Inspired Computing). Did they just remove the undergrad version of this class with another course with the same number? Are they really the same? The prereqs for the classes do seem different. I want to know because I'm more interested in taking the brain-inspired version, so I might take that during grad years (assuming I get in). <eos> \n",

However even if they take it $150 is still something that i can't pay. Do i have any other options? Has anyone been in the same situation?

But I wanted to spread out and explore my options instead of just buying the same thing. I lso had a casemate notebook, but I noticed that on a lot of the older pages, the pencil begins to smudge and there are remnants of the old notes imprinted on the new ones. What is the best sort of notebook for college notetaking? I need a 100 page, 1-subject spiral notebook. Do you guys have any suggestions?

I'm very clean and small group orientated. I like parties, but I'm not an avid goer. I mainly enjoy outdoors activity and nature, and I am indifferent towards city environments. My preference is suburban apartments with peace and quiet. I love socializing, but getting drunk off my ass or doing excessive drugs isn't my thing. What housing would be best for me in your opinion?  Also, the stickied transfer advice is old, so any other recent advice for a transfer newcomer? Thank you <eos> \n",

No?) Unfortunately right now I'm a grad student at Bloustein, and given that we're downtown we're a bit out of touch with the rest of you, so I don't have any real leads. For a city renowned for the strength of its punk and basement show scene I'm drawing a lot of blanks... Any ideas before I resort to CL? Is there anything in the Targum?

I'm really scared that this will show up on my criminal record or a background check that employers would look up - I might be transferring out of Rutgers this year, and I don't want my chances for internships ruined by this stuff. I wasn't fingerprinted or anything but google is giving me some ambiguous answers - law firms tend to advertise on their websites that underage drinking will show up on checks performed by employers and educational institutions, but no official NJ website does. Does anybody with any experience with this have the answer? It's really stressing me out. <eos> \n",

I'm majoring in math so I am required to take it, I tried last semester and failed miserably, it was easily the hardest class I've ever took in my life (ik this sounds silly to many people, but sadly this isn't sarcasm) and I just wanna know how you did to pass the class. Thank you, <eos> \n",

For example, last year during Irene I parked in Douglass Deck (was worried that my apartment parking lot would flood), was parked there for 2 or 3 days and didn't get a ticket.. so I guess as far as cars go, I'd suggest parking in one of the decks to make sure your car doesn't get flooded. RUPD doesn't ticket much during rain to begin with, so it should not be an issue. Also, uh, eat everything perishable... personally, because of Irene we had no power for 4 days (on-campus apartment on C/D) and all of our fridge/frozen food went bad. Anything else? <eos> \n",

I've invited you guys to an event we held last semester (our art exhibition at BCC), and I was ecstatic to see a couple of Redditors stop by and say hi! So, I'd like to invite you guys again to come to our Spring event tomorrow night; below is the official invitation we've been circulating around, but the important points are: * Interesting discussion and presentations from Rutgers professors * Free dinner (though donations are appreciated!) * Lots of hand-made, microenterprise goods from villages in Thailand available for purchase Thanks for reading this long post, and I hope to see some of you guys there (I'll be the Asian guy on stage; you can be whatever you want). -------------- You are cordially invited to attend an event hosted by the em[POWER] Rutgers Chapter and Warm Heart Rutgers Chapter titled: **Honoring the Past, Building a Better Future: Genocide, Poverty, and Renewable Development** Date: Wednesday, April 6th Time: 7PM-10PM Location: Livingston Student Center, Livingston Hall  The Warm Heart and em[POWER] Rutgers Chapters are excited to present to you our spring event: \"Honoring the Past, Building a Better Future: Genocide, Poverty, and Renewable Development\".The goal of the event is to create discussion and trace a connection between genocide (and corruption) to poverty and sustainable development. This connection can be described as a direction of hope for the people trapped by isolating conditions as a governing theme of this event. Our event will feature Professor Alex Hinton, the Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Genocide, Conflict Resolution, and Human Rights at Rutgers Newark, Professor Elizabeth Amaya Fernadez from Rutgers Health Services, and a speaker from the organization Irate. The event will also include our second annual em[POWER] Students for Service competition, where one group of Rutgers students will be awarded a cash prize to help them accomplish their community development project! --------------------------------------------------------- A full dinner will be served for free as a courtesy to our guests, but any donation you wish to contribute to both organizations will be greatly appreciated. Beautiful Thai hand-crafted products will be available for purchase at the event, made through the Warm Heart Microenterprise Project. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I took a course last summer at my county college after registering for it last minute as a sort of contingency; however, I completely forgot to transfer in the credits in as it wasn't a required pre-req until now, and neither had I filled out a pre-approval form from Rutgers SOE department. Can I still transfer these credits in to count towards my degree? The online FAQ isn't too clear as all it states is that \"a preauthorization form MUST be filled,\" and doesn't provide instructions on how to transfer in credits after taking them. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Has anyone recently made a purchase at the Wendy's on College Ave (the restaurant inside the Student Center Food Court) using their debit card? I made a purchase about a week ago and never saw any withdrawal on my bank statements from Wendy's - perhaps this has something to do with poor implementation of their new registers? Anyway I'm just wondering if this is a widespread problem (my bank, Wells Fargo told me there are cases where merchants never ask for authorization so it's a weird situation). <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi /r/rutgers, I'm looking for a roommate for an off-campus house near the College Ave campus. It's a 2BR apartment with a shared living room, kitchen, and bathroom. I am renting out one of the bedrooms so you would have your own personal space. The only utilities we pay for are electric/gas and cable. There are no parking rules (no permits, assigned spaces, etc.). It's a 20 minute walk to the College Ave. campus and the Easton Ave. bars (I did this walk for 2 years and it was no problem). Rent is about $615 per month and security deposit is $925. First month's rent and security deposit is due on 7/25/14 at the latest (and I'd like to have to it sent in earlier than that). I'm pretty easy-going and laid back and I'm looking for someone who is basically the same way. I just graduated with my masters and I'll be working full-time by the time the place is ready to be rented out, so someone who is in school is fine but working people are OK too. I'm fine with drinking but no drugs please. I'm also a big video game nerd. Recently I've been playing DOTA 2, Transistor, Diablo 3 (expansion), and a few others.  Message me and we can skype and see if we would be a good fit!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Good evening all, Long story short, I was admitted for spring 2018 and due to some extreme circumstances out of my control, my grades tanked as school wasn’t the main priority due to my personal situation (won’t get into it on here for obvious reasons). Bc of that really bad fall semester, they revoked my admission. My spring semester was good for the most part, but I had one D on my transcript. I just finished a class at RU, I’m finishing up a class at my CC and the grades for those two should be out by this week. I am taking another class at ru rn, but that doesn’t end til August 2nd . Right now I only have 6 new credits from the summer and the 14 from spring since my app was last reviewed by SAS and SEBS. I want to apply to RU (for fall 2018) next week bc they are still talking applications. I want to wait until August bc admissions told me the more credits the better for reconsideration. However I’m worried that there will be no space by August.  I really can’t do another semester at my CC. I have no more financial aid bc I was only given it for 4 semesters. I’ve taken all of the classes offered in my major, so things are exhausted. I have been working full time all summer to not only pay for these classes that I’ve been taking as a visiting student, but to also help out with paying for bills and monthly mortgage payments. I’m only 19 and everything is always going downhill. I don’t want to be told to wait do another year at CC bc I don’t have that option.  Tl;dr: should I wait until August 2nd to apply to RU or should I just do it this week when grades for 6 new credits have come out?  <eos> \n",

Any help would be appreciated. thanks.  Update Nov 7th: got it replaced. No problems. Topic didn't even come up. Thanks again for the comments 👍 <eos> \n",

Even better if you include which foods you like from there... :) thanks <eos> \n",

With this in mind, I have to change up my fall schedule. I have Ap credits for Us history, Statistics, Ap calc BC(AB), and physics C: Mechanics. Im assuming that i should decline the physics credits since i am now going into engineering. Im not entirely sure which classes i'm allowed to take or if I get special permission, take engineering classes. I just need someone to help me with adjusting my schedule for this fall semester so that when I switch to engineering, im not too far behind. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone! I'm going to be attending Rutgers Masters in Social Work grad program starting in the fall and I am looking to put together a house of fellow male students so that we can cut on our rent. No difficult to please douche-bags please. I am a laid back, quiet, hardworking guy who likes to chill and play video games, and the ideal housemate would also be the same kind of person. However, I would definitely like to throw some parties, have massive house dinner parties, throw some raging shit-shows and generally have fun. You should be an easy going person who doesn't use drugs (light pot use is OK by me as long as the non-smokers aren't effected) and focuses on your studies more than partying. You should also play video games, especially MOBAs, but anything besides Farmville is fine. I have am HD projector that we should all be gaming on at some point as well (especially if we all play the same thing and are competitive!) I'm basically looking for some academically focused, intelligent, emotionally stable, pro-social gaming nerds. If this sounds like you, please message me and I will try to pool everyone together so we can figure out what to do. If you play these games, you will score major points with me immediately: DOTA, Starcraft, Diablo, League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, Call of Duty, Skyrim, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effect, Civilization. Edit: Added games list. <eos> \n",

Currently, i have an awful 6 year old laptop and i want to upgrade before i start. I tried researching and found that Rutgers really doesn't recomend any specific laptobs to get.

I've been studying Japanese for a year and a half now, but I'm currently in a position where I don't think I can bring up my verbal fluency without getting more face to face opportunities to converse in Japanese.

Im going to be living on college ave this year and have heard that the gym is always crowded. I am fairly shy and am not really looking to mainly lift the entire time. I am mostly looking to do cardio and some lifting once in a while. How is the cardio equipment at the college ave gym? Do they have stationary bikes like the ones that are frequently used in spin classes (I like those the best)? And are there a fair amount of treadmills etc. Do they have mats for body weight workouts? Im looking to finally get into tip top shape so Ill be grateful for any feedback that makes me more comfortable. Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I just received my chem 1 exam score, lower than 48%, which strongly recommends me to take Chem 133. The first exam didn't seem too hard, but a lot of the questions were questions I was unfamiliar with as they weren't similar to the practice exam and homework. I thought of the practice exam and HW easy, but the actual exam was an entire new world. I later talked to people who did well, and I realized that one of the biggest misses I did when studying was not doing any practice problems from the textbook/syllabus. I already have a fairly heavy courseload (Discrete 1, Comp Arch and Intro to Linear Algebra). If i were to take 133, I would be able to have a lot of stress out of mind. At the same time, I also didn't even do well on my first exam for Discrete as well, meaning I also have another class i'm panicking about. All of this stress and work is even preventing me from focusing on applying for internships. My GPA isn't so hot (about a 2.9), and i'm trying to use this semester to help increase it. But i'm wondering if Chem 133 is really worth it to miss out my chance to finish up Chem 161 and move on to Chem 162. I can also reconsider about taking physics if I do make this decision. I know about the Final Exam Replacement Rule and having to attend remediaton, but there's a strong risk if I decide to stay. So for those of you who have taken 133, how efficient was it when you retook Chem 161? And for everyone, what do you believe is my best decision? Should I go for 133 and make my life easier, or attempt take the risk of taking remediation and hope that I do well for the rest of the course? <eos> \n",

I crossed out driving completely since I know the parking situation can be very frustrating and I do not enjoy driving in general. Plus I live less than 5 minutes from the closest train. If I were to dorm I would prefer for it to be on campus rather than off campus since I wouldn't know people who would want to split rent. I have friends that already live in Rutgers NB (off and on campus). However I know that I will have to get more loans in order to live on campus.  I am also coming in as a re-admitted student. I previously went to Rutgers for one semester (Fall 2010) and withdrew because of financial reasons. I'm finishing up at my local community college and am in the process of doing the re-admittance application. I've already asked the people close to me of their opinion but I just need more advice, possibly from people who commute or others who were/are re-admitted students.  Was it hard to get on-campus housing after re-apply? Edit: I'm currently looking at off-campus housing since most of you advised that its better and cheaper that on-campus housing. Also looking for jobs around NB. Thank you for reading my post and giving me input! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I recently transferred to Rutgers and noticed many science fields at SAS only offer bachelor of arts degrees. The major I was planning on declaring was cell biology and neuroscience, but this is a Bachelor of Arts degree even though the curriculum is identical to what you would do at most other universities for a Bachelor of Science. Am I missing something? Looking at majors for Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Genetics, and many other 'science' fields SAS awards only bachelor of arts although the courses you have to take are the same as everywhere else where you would get a BSc. But its not even every major since majors like Exercise Science or Public Health (???) apparently awards you a BSc? Is there a reason for this? Will getting a BA instead of BSc in a science field make any difference to grad schools/employers even though there's no choice? I'm a little worried that it will come across as less rigorous even though the content is the same. <eos> \n",

I have noticed that other people that I personally know have applied and have been hearing back in as little as 10 days to a couple of weeks. Schools I have been admitted to have also gotten back to me in as little as a few days. Does this longer wait time ultimately mean that I am going to be rejected? Or is it just a bureaucracy thing? I only ask b/c I have previously been rejected for the current semester, so it's not totally irrational to assume this.

My reg date was set for tomorrow at 6:30 am, but I checked the website on a whim, and I was able to sign up for everything I needed just a few minutes ago. I think I was let into the system early. There might be a variety of factors at work here, but my advice to you is to try the web reg and see if you can get in. Maybe you'll be let in early, too. It can't hurt. Good luck with Spring 2012!

I was also living with horrible people that just did not help my work ethic or lifestyle choices. Anyway.... After confronting my issues mentally I am finally ready to start my life again. I was working at first over the summer and thru october but working physical labor was just crushing me physically and depression wasn't helping me tackle my issues. But now I'm looking for work in my field (Public health) I am 12 credits away from graduating but I can't seem to find work.  Anyone have any advice on what to do?? I'm tired of not living and I just can't see myself doing customer service after actually having 1 year of actual Research intern. Like I understand its a keep applying till you get something. But has anyone gone thru this that has good advice, I want to start saving so I can go back and finish over the summer. Oh and I can't go back until the summer cuz I'm out of state and its just not feasible to start back in the spring. <eos> \n",

I'm taking data structures with Professor Venugopal, and I wanted to know how he is and is data structure just like CS111, meaning same midterms/homework/etc for all sections?  I was also wondering about how Professor Ullman was for Calc II. And lastly, I also wanted to know about Professor Tesler for Expos. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I've recently added push notifications to my NJ Rails app and would like to extract the push of that into a stand alone app.  The new app will be a combination of news and entertainment events that are pushed to your phone in real time (the only delay is networking io and database queries). Here is how it works: We keep a stream open to twitter listening for tweets from accounts we have approved. We query the user's preferences to see if they want to receive that alert. We push the alert out.  I have been testing this for a few weeks now and I want more data being pushed to my phone. However, I have limited time and need some help curating lists and in some instances manually pushing news. I'm gauging if there is any interest for others to collaborate on this with me. Just need competent people and you do not need to be a cs major. Interested parties can email mrpushr@wmwm.us <eos> \n",

Additionally, users can view information about current and upcoming semesters. This includes prerequisites, course specific information and even professor ratings and details.  I recently updated my app with RateMyProfessors.com integration. It's faster, more stable, a little bit more prettier and also has some Android Wear features.  **Possible new features?** I also have professor room, phone and fax numbers, full building names (instead of abbreviations), but they have not made their way into the app as yet. Let me know if it should be a priority.  **Beta?** If you want newer features faster you[ follow this link to become a beta tester.]([url link] **What about iPhone?** I hope to get an iPhone version out by next Spring. :/ Previous threads: [url link] [url link] <eos> \n",

Livi/Busch preferred, although I'm not sure if anything is available for Busch (I thought Metzger would be an option but it's not on the list). Quads III also a possibility hopefully. Lottery number is kinda average at best (5451).  Deciding between math/comp sci/physics major atm. I'll probably be gaming (League, cs go, poe, etc.) most of the day if not in class, so I'll be in the room often. Don't really have much roommate preferences, other than being reasonably clean + chill. I'll keep to myself.  <eos> \n",

A little background for why I'm asking: I'm a transfer student coming in as a sophomore so I'm a little behind on the curriculum. I want to get a prerequisite override so I can take CS111 (Intro) and CS112 (Data Structures) in the same semester. This'd be the only way I could hope to squeeze into the honors program.

            "<bos> I’m starting the Doctorate of Clinical Nutrition program in the Fall, which is entirely online. I was charged a $700 iPad fee and a $150 Nutrition Software fee. Neither of which I was aware of.  Does anyone know if these fees can be opted out of? I already have an iPad and can’t even image why one would be required for the program. If it can’t be waived, does that mean they will be sending me an iPad? (I’m in California) Also- I paid a $200 “tuition deposit” when accepting my admission. This hasn’t been credited to the Fall semester. “Deposit” implies that money would go towards my first semester tuition.  I have called and emailed the billing office with no response. If anyone has an insight it would be appreciated.  <eos> \n",

[url link] I came from a four year college that has similar difficulty to Rutgers, so I'm not worried about the large amounts of credits I'm taking. As for Data Structures, I already know the material. Only class I'm really worried about is Calc 3. My calc 1 and 2 classes were extremely easy, and I've heard Rutgers calculus is difficult.  I've tailored my schedule so I can work hard Mon-thur, get fucked up Thursday Night- Friday night, and then chill / work on the weekends. As for socializing, I pretty much have all the lunch times open, and I have room to weight lift 4-5 times a week. This is just my opinion EDIT: This is 18 credits <eos> \n",

I'm choosing to move into dorms and because this is so different than my college experience at CC, my parents have been bugging me about term bills and financial aid packages since we really didn't have that as a problem for us the past two years...

            "<bos> I'm a first year in SoE and I'm thinking about declaring BME as my engineering major but I have a few questions before I fully confirm. 1. How hard is the BME curriculum compared to the other engineering curriculums (ECE, MechE, chemical, civil, etc)? 2. Do most BME graduates go directly into work after graduation or do they go to grad school?  3. For those that go straight to work after graduation, is it true that job prospects for BME's (those with a B.S) are significantly worse than other engineering majors particularly MechE and ECE?  <eos> \n",

I was looking at google earth and I'm thinking that the general location where my first year classes would be is North West of the Raritan River, not South East, is that correct? I have juvenile arthritis and I'm hoping it will slowly get better after a few years but until then, I'm concerned about my travel distance. Would I be provided a nearby dorm wherever the majority of my classes would be for the first two years? Another question I have is if someone would be so kind as to list the names of the buildings where my first year classes would be so I have a general idea by looking at the map. It is very important to me as I sometimes need a cane and don't plan to use my wheelchair for college. The thought of having to bus everywhere irks me and is one of my points of deciding whether to apply or not. Thank you very much. <eos> \n",

Almost all of the classes I need to take are already full, and I can't even register until June. (Maybe even later because Rutgers won't process/honor my full Associates transfer until August). According to what I know, I'm already waived from the SAS Core, so all I have left is 206, 344 and 7 CS electives. Is this the RU Screw? Can I just take one class in the Fall or do I still have to be a full-time student? Will they open more sections? I can't believe Rutgers just wants me to burn an entire semester with no classes actually available. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm interested in taking either of these classes and I'm looking for opinions from those who have taken these classes or could offer insight. I'm very interested in Europe, economics and politics. While ideally I would take both of these classes, I can not. Contemporary Europe offers a very appealing syllabus with a reasonable workload and interesting readings but I know nothing about the professor. Marx  Marxist Theory has no available syllabus but the teacher, from what I've read on rate my professor, is extremely interesting, passionate, and has many academic accomplishments. I can not gauge the workload, however, given that there is no available syllabus online. So how do I choose between a class that has an appealing structure or a class how has an appealing professor? I'm equally passionate about these topics and I think it might be very rewarding to be able to study under an accomplish professor.  Can anyone give some insight into my dilemma? Has anyone taken these classes and can offer me feedback about how the courses went? Also, if it is of any significance to your answer, I am taking 18 credits Spring semester. <eos> \n",

I wouldn't mind transferring(yea this is late). For those of you who are in these programs would you say both majors require the same amount of social networking. Would one major have more employers? Also how social do you have to be for a job in both programs. Not sure if it's applies to all but some engineering students have been telling me they received similar jobs as business people(consultant). Just want to know which route I should take, especially since I keep getting told I'm not 'social enough' to get a job in RBS. Thanks for any insight! <eos> \n",

I was only able to use AP scores for 8 credits during pharmacy school (used it for Bio), and I was wondering if anyone knew if the rest of my AP scores could be used now that I am an SAS student.  Do the scores ever expire, or is there a time limit in which I can use them? I took these exams almost 10 years ago now, but I would like to use the scores for Calculus credit if possible.

The biggest problem is that I live about two hours away from the university, so I'm not really in the position to pick it up myself. My first thought was to call the mailing department and maybe see if they could mail it to me, no matter any additional costs, but I can't seem to find a number to call - only an email address, and this is a process I'd rather talk to someone with. Is there number for the mailing department that anyone knows I can call? Would the mail department even be willing to do something like this? <eos> \n",

Therefore my suspension is sustained for the year of 2017-2018. I can apply for reenrollment for next summer but it isn't guaranteed. Also, the dean said that I can't do anything to improve my chance of reenrollment since they don't look at the grades from community college when deciding whether I can reenroll or not.

Does anyone know if RU will let me switch my housing from my single to that vacancy for the spring if it's pre-arranged between my friends and I? It wouldn't be a proper room swap because the friend who is graduating obviously wouldn't be switching with me - my single would be open for someone else to take it in the spring.

Honestly, I sorta expected a C at minimum considering I got A's in my honors English classes back in high school and got a perfect score on my SAT essay, but I guess college is different. I wanted to sign up for the Writing Center, but apparently, that's a 1.5 credit course that requires meetings every week otherwise you fail. I don't want that to show up on my transcript, nor do I think I can commit to it every week. I'm in the SASHP which also offers tutoring, but not for Expos which sucks. Is there like walk-in tutoring for expos or anything else that I don't know about?  <eos> \n",

So I need to know if I have to notify someone that of a withdrawal or just not do anything. Since I didn't take my Rutgers transcript with me it's not like they know I'm transferring from the school.

            "<bos> so last semester I was looking into rushing a fraternity here at rutgers. I didn’t end up doing so because both of my parents had to undergo serious surgeries and i wouldn’t have been able to make the time commitment. Now that I have a little more time on my hands this semester, I wanted to rush a fraternity and get involved with philanthropy and being able to have a bond with a group of people. I’m just concerned about being hazed. I’m just a little worried that my sexuality (I’m gay) might trigger issues during my rush/pledge process. Does anybody know of any progressive/accepting fraternities on campus that I should look into? <eos> \n",

Class seems *okay* so far, but sometimes that can be misleading when it comes time for the test. Has anyone taken the class at all, and can you describe, idk, how to study for the tests or what the tests were like and if office hours is worth it?  And if anyone is currently taking the class, pleaaaaaaaaaase study with me?  Thank you! :) <eos> \n",

NextBus hasn't been phased out yet, but probably will either by the end of this year or next.

I've signed up on course sniper, but it still remains to be seen if I'll actually get the course, so I was wondering if it's a common practice (or common enough, really) to offer proficiency exams for intro level classes. I did take the AP Comp Sci exam, but only got a 4 (which is not enough to gain credit for the intro course) since my school didn't offer a course and I'm self taught in node.js/python, whereas the exam's open ended section is in Java. Given these circumstances, if I find myself unable to get into the class, should I look to try to contact the dean/professor of the course to attempt to arrange a proficiency exam (and study Java independently until then) so that I will be able to take more advanced courses next semester? I'm also open to any other options as well, but I don't know if any others exist. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm attending Rutgers Newark, majoring in Computer Science (BA). I've chosen Newark over New Brunswick because of the shorter commute (18 min vs. 1 hour). I know that Rutgers New Brunswick is generally regarded as the better campus in many regards, but I'm wandering if most employers care about am applicant's campus of graduation. Say that an applicant graduated from RU Newark, with a BA in Computer Science. Would he have good employment prospects or would employers pass him up for someone \"better\"? <eos> \n",

I requested my move-in date for August 25. However, I have not gotten an email confirming that I can move in early.

I took AP Physics B and AP Biology (which is now half the workload it was last year) in HS. Will I still be pretty fucked? I am by no means an amazing student. I didn't even get into calc in HS; I'm just in adv precalc and barely passing.  Did I set my self up for a workload no one would be able to handle? What classes do people normally get? One of my class mates said that it is normal to take only 1 science class a year if one is a science major. <eos> \n",

Now my sister who lives on High St is likely going to travel the country for a bit and I can move into her house, but I need someone to share it with. If anyone's not sure about the location, High St is right by Robert Wood Johnson, about a 10 minute walk to the Scott Hall bus stop. Rent would be $500/month each, anyone interested? Also, if anyone is looking to fill a space in their house, I'd be happy to hear about that too. Thanks everyone. Edit: I'm a guy, pretty indifferent about living with guys or girls. I'm also a non-smoker, but not terribly opposed to living with smokers. And this is for '13-'14. <eos> \n",

I get you pay full-time for the first semester but for the last semester I will only need about 8-credits and qualify for part-time student status. Does Rutgers do something special tuition wise for last semester seniors tuition wise? Anyone know what to expect, like pay a certain amount per credit instead of a set price for entire semester? <eos> \n",

I have currently have been doing very well on the assignments however (according to the autograder). Anybody know if I can still even get a decent grade for the class, if not at least pass? I have Francisco btw, but his class uses the same assignments as Santosh but I believe our midterm was harder than his, resulting in a lower average than the other. Does anybody know what the minimum grade for Santosh's class to pass as well, and his curve in general? EDIT: If anybody misread my post, the AVERAGE WAS a 42% or 54/128. I got something horrifically lower. <eos> \n",

I'd have to be there at 8:45 AM until 2:50 and obviously that would be a really annoying commute to have to take so early. I have a car on campus and I've been looking at where I could park for free. People have been saying to park in the Sears lot but they have also said that people's cars get broken into there. I've also seen that I could park at Tov Manor, but I'm not really sure how legit that is. Anyway, any tips for parking for the class that would minimize my commute but also keep me and my car safe? Thanks! <eos> \n",

All my assignments for the week are done, I have yet to join any clubs, I honestly have no clue what to do and I don't want to sit in my dorm watching Netflix all weekend. I'm not really the partying type, I don't feel like I'd fit in with that crowd if I tried and I don't really have enough friends here yet to feel comfortable going out on the town, so I'm at a loss for how to fill my weekends. I don't wanna be the guy who goes home every weekend, because that's terribly boring.  The stuff I like includes gaming (tabletop and vidya), science stuff (I wouldn't mind checking out a museum), movies (I checked out Rutgers Cinema but they're not playing anything I'm into this weekend :/), nerd stuff basically. But I really like just exploring new places, so I'm open to anything that might be worth doing around New Brunswick! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I heard it gets unsafe(r) once you get farther away from campus so I was looking at off-campus housing options that are still considered \"on campus.\" Particularly 12 Bartlett and Rockoff Apartments. I don't really know of any others but if you do know of any (any campus and preferably not College Ave tbh), please let me know.  How are the noise levels at these apartments? I heard it's way too loud at 12 Bartlett because of party people at night but I like the interior. Not sure about Rockoff. I'm looking for a single room apartment with a kitchen and I'm the type to study in my room and stuff. Also can't really sleep with noise... But I really want to live in apartment for next year so I can get off this meal plan and just overall feel better. Also, I have no car for transportation.   <eos> \n",

I'm an older transfer (25) who's about to graduate and felt quite apathetic about making friends here. Mostly due to the age gap and the fact that most social circles were established by the time I got here. However, I know I'm not alone and if there are any transfers or anyone out there who's been on the same boat I'd like to organize a meetup at a BAR some time next week. I know the past few reddit meetups here have been awkward as fuck, which is why I'm chosing for it to be at a bar. I'm thinking Stuff Yet Face since you don't have to be 21 to get in. And perhaps if some of us click we can all hit up one last party before the semester ends. What do you guys think? Who's up for it? <eos> \n",

My classes (both this and next semester) tend to be in **Scott Hall/Vorhees Mall** area and wanna know if there are any parking lots closer to those buildings than where I currently park. For the whole semester, I've parked behind the **College Ave Gym/Student Center** and as it gets colder, it's less convenient to walk back to my car.  I know there's a list of which lots we can park in on each campus, but I honestly just hope there is someone else who's commuting, whose home parking is on Livi but also has night classes on College and knows this stuff so I don't have to struggle to find which lot is which at night.

            "<bos> I will be a transfer student to Rutgers this Fall. I'm currently on the verge of finishing my Associates at CC but I withdrew from Calculus 2, which would be the last class I need to finish my degree. While I breezed through CC with a 3.97 GPA, Calc 2 was the only class that gave me serious trouble and I withdrew due to having a low grade that wasn't going to transfer and would kill my GPA. What would be the difference if I transferred with my degree finished vs having one class left? I'm trying to figure out whether it would be better if I retook the class in CC during the summer or take it at Rutgers and transfer it over to my CC? If I retake it in the summer, I'll have to pay for a 5 credit course out of pocket, which would be very costly. Also the same professor will be teaching the summer class. EDIT: If it helps, a lot of the difficulty for me in Calc 2 for me came from how my professor made his tests. The entire class grade was made up of 5 tests. Each test has 8-10 questions, often made from the hard problems in each chapter. There was little room for error in his tests so one mistake killed your chance of getting an A. Also, he didn't curve and he allows you to retake one test which he makes 100X harder than the original.  <eos> \n",

I had to type pages of outline for my bio class senior year so maybe it’d be useful. (AP version of the Cambell bio textbook) I was looking at previous posts on the subreddit about the course and I guess I know what to expect academically, just wanna make sure it’s still relevant since I saw a post about outlines.  How’s Chem1? I have a decent background in basic chemistry but nothing crazy. I assume it’s mostly all the basics and goes into stoichiometry/mols towards the end?  The other two classes people have already answered FAQ so thanks to everyone who previously answered those questions!  Last one: is this schedule crazy? My expectations is to work hard but it won’t be extremely intensive as I expect it to be if I manage my time correctly. Thanks everyone:)   <eos> \n",

I don't particularly want to sit in a large lecture if I can avoid it. I don't mind a heavy workload or difficult class, as long as the material and readings are interesting (and yes, I know that varies by person).  Does anyone know of small (say, 30 or less) classes that fulfill either of these core codes?  They don't have to be offered this fall - I'm a rising junior so I have 4 semesters left.  (And, if no such small classes exist, any recommendations for ones with a great professor? Again, I'm okay with a heavy workload and/or challenging class) <eos> \n",

When I spoke to an advisor this Wednesday, I was told that since I come in with an Associate's in CS, all my core classes would be fulfilled. He continued by saying not to worry about java that any class I decide to take will teach me new languages any way. **tl;dr how necessary is it to know Java to complete the CS degree at Rutgers?** (Sorry if this is a dumb question) I've been looking at some of the offered courses and I can't help but feel its incredibly important. They seem to suggest that I should be learning it so that im not behind all the students who have Java experience already. **I'm Just worried I might be coming into the major ill prepared.** Any links to better prepare for my next steps would be appreciated immensely and thanks! <eos> \n",

Is it feasible to double major with one major being computer science? Any stories of how difficult/doable it is from people who've double majored like that?   My second major would be Physics probably.  If a double major is too hard, how difficult is it to get a minor in something? Is it recommended to get a minor, or is a minor more just for more self knowledge?  Thanks!! (Sorry another lost freshman post)   <eos> \n",

I know there is add/drop week, but I was just wondering, is it very hard, since I am a freshman? Also, how is the class and professor in general? Apparently, from what I've seen, it's Galili? Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm 18 credits away from graduating, so I decided that I'll be taking 15 credits in the Spring and 3 credits in the Summer to finish things off at Rutgers. I'm a CS major, and I need to take three more electives to graduate. My plan is to take three CS courses totaling 12 credits, and an extra filler class so that I'll have 15 credits. I'm currently registered for 12 credits on Webreg so that it knows I'm a full-time student. Here's what I'm registered for currently, and all of these are subject to change: CS 352 (Internet Technology) Section 1 with Martin, Richard CS 415 (Compilers) Section 1 with Kremer, U CS 416 (Oper System Design) Section 1 with Francisco, J And for the extra 3 credit class I'm thinking about taking Digital Composition. Has anyone taken any of these classes before? Did you think they were interesting? Is the workload manageable, and are the professors any good? I originally wanted to take Intro to AI, but that filled up incredibly fast so I had to settle for another CS elective. I also thought about taking Game Design Methodology, but that's also filled up, and I need a SPN for that. If I absolutely had to I suppose I could make due with this current schedule for the Spring, but if possible I'd like to avoid classes that have a bad reputation. So if there's any class you guys think I should swap with another class, I'm open to suggestions. Thanks. <eos> \n",

There is no way I am letting my friend shell out $15 bucks to stay the weekend. Is there any parking in town that is free/costs less and wont get towed in the middle of the night? I dont mind if its a bit further away. EDIT: Thanks everyone! Ill test the waters on a few of these suggestions. <eos> \n",

I'm confused because it also says \"attendance has been confirmed/ term bill received\" and my payments are showing on the bill. Should I just leave things as is since it's definitely showing I'm paying through an RUTPP? Contact their office? I don't want to mess anything up here and possibly get late fees. I also can't seem to shake the pirg charge, as there is no option when I click \"continue to online bill payment to confirm attendance\"... <eos> \n",

Also, is Discrete Structures worth taking?

I was thinking that I could simply use the unofficial transcript to do the job, but am second guessing if they would possibly change their format in the course name. For example, my unofficial transcript has this class \"Quality Mgmt In Medical Imaging\" --- I wonder if the official transcript would say \"Quality Management in Medical Imaging\" Thanks guys <eos> \n",

I'm looking for an upper level math class that is not ridiculously difficult to take next semester. The easier the better, since my course load as a MechE is incredibly demanding. I know that no upper-level math class is going to be a walk in the park, but I would appreciate any feedback! Thank you for your help in advance. tl;dr - Math majors, what are some easier upper level math classes? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> so about 2-3 weeks ago i lost my black windbreaker with my dorm keys inside one of the pockets, somewhere on College Ave. i’ve checked the AB building lost and found, brower lost and found, and college ave gym lost and found all with no luck :(  the reason i haven’t gone to public safety yet is because when i check their database for keys, none of the descriptions match mine. the ones that do are all old and outdated. if anyone has any ideas of where else i could check lmk. also this is slightly unrelated, but i do not understand why the public safety database has NO option for clothing, jackets or anything related to apparel that you wear, as an “option” to look up. i would say clothing is like number 2 on the list of most misplaced stuff w/ keys being number 1. just my 2 cents...  any replies r greatly appreciated. i don’t really want to have to spend mad bread for a spare dorm key. thank you <eos> \n",

Considering these are my grades after a curve, I think I did very poorly. I studied hard, but I was just overwhelmed at how lectures flew by material so quickly. I guess I wasn't used to covering such large volume of material in a shorter period of time compared to high school. Obviously, I know I have to study even harder now to repair this mistake. My question is, can I still manage a B+ or A in these classes even with these bad midterm grades? Is it just me or do all new college students struggle to adapt to the nature of [first] exams in college? If I were to get a mediocre final grade in a class, is retaking the course the next semester/year a good idea?  <eos> \n",

However, the TAG grant value that was there yesterday has now disappeared from my term bill, and it is also gone from my award letter. Does anyone have the same problem? I had already set up a payment plan (RUTPP) factoring in the TAG grant but now I'm worried that I will come up short when paying my tuition. <eos> \n",

Didnt really care since i figured it didnt matter cause they couldnt trace it... Started driving my car again and have been only parking in my assigned lot, come to find 7 days later i have a $75 financial hold on my account from parking services.  One ive never registered my moms vehicle in the system, nor does she even have the same last name as me. So like how is this possible? Does anyone know how to fight this/how to, cause i dont have the ticket anymore.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi guys! I'm a Visual Arts major, concentration in graphic design. This is my second year at Rutgers and my fourth year of college (transfer from community college). I'm going to have to do a 5th year because I kind of got screwed over by both Rutgers and CC. I'm considering changing my degree from a BFA (Mason Gross) to a BA (SAS) before next year because... 1. I may not be able to graduate in 5 years if I continue with the BFA because two classes that I need will conflict based on the schedules for the past few semesters. Unless they add more sections or give me special permission to leave class half an hour early, I'd have to stay in school longer 2. I feel like they expect us to eat, sleep, and breathe art. That's not really my thing. I've been taking all art classes, but I'd like to take a class in something else that interests me. If I switched to a BA I'd be able to take a few non-art classes. 3. I don't really want to take thesis  exhibition. I was talking to someone from my design class and we both agreed that it's more geared towards painting, sculpture, etc. majors. It's not required with a BA as far as I know. The thing is, I'm not sure if switching to BA would put me at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a job. Does the degree really matter? Any input would be appreciated :) <eos> \n",

Does this mean they already decided not to hire me?? Or did they just find asking people to edit the jpeg portion useless? edit: i got accepted, phew <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been accepted to Rutgers School of Arts and Science. I'm scheduled to take the placement test on April 21st. I've heard that the math test places a lot of emphasis on pre-calc topics, which I am awful with. I'm currently taking calculus at my high school. I'm maintaining an A in that class but I got a C in pre-calc last year (has a lot to do with the teacher, last year's sucked, this year's is awesome). I'd really just like to know if anyone has any advice for me or any good review materials. I've accepted the fact that I'm going to bomb the foreign language test but I'm really worried about math. I don't want to take pre-calc again. I'd love any help here guys and gals.  tl;dr I'm worried about the math placement test. Any advice? edit: Just realized today is my cake day!

            "<bos> Please note that this has entirely to do with my commuting and work situation. Otherwise, I always attend lectures. What I might do though is attend one lecture/recitation a week if my situation permits. I've had Steinberg before for CS111.  From what I recall, his exams were straightforward (no surprises or silly lecture-based trivia), and he puts good slides up (though I heard he may have stopped doing that? Might be thinking of another class). Since he can be difficult to understand, I feel like I won't miss out on entirely too much. I've always been more of a self-study guy. My real concern would be if too much of the exam is based on stuff that you really should have been in class for, missing out on really comprehensive reviews where the professor ends up giving up half the test, etc. Also quick question: does recitation attendance matter/are there recitation quizzes? I'd probably end up attending the recitation I'm not registered for out of convenience for my schedule. Thanks for any help! <eos> \n",

My question is this: I took an honors section last time (Section No. H#), but this time I am not (Section number ##). Will the difference between sections prevent me from having my new grade override my F in my GPA calculations, or is it fine because the Course Number is still the same? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Over the weekend, there was a death in my family. Today I went and spoke to the Dean of Students about not being able to take the second exam this Sunday because of having to travel back home, and mentally, obviously not being \"all in it\" after their death.  The Dean said that it shouldn't be a problem and that he would sign off on it, however, when I asked who I talk to about a retake on another day, he said that Boikess does not give retakes, but that I would just be exempt from that exam. That sounds pleasant to the naked ear, however, now exams 1 and 3 are weighed twice as hard, and as someone who wasn't too happy with their first exam score, was depending heavily on this one to get some points back.  Basically, I was wondering if anyone has experience with this sort of approach (i.e., no retake, just no exam), and how it could be beneficial, and should I just say screw it and take the shot on Sunday, to cover up the weight on just those two exams (besides the final)? I know this seems convoluted but so is my brain right now, so I'm pretty lost and unsure what the best option is.  <eos> \n",

I want to get him a new one, but Dining Services doesn't sell them to the public, as far as I can tell. Are there any blackshirts who work there who are willing to get an extra shirt and sell it to me? Thanks <eos> \n",

I am not necessarily looking for the classic gpa booster classes like art appreciation, dance appreciation. One class will not improve my gpa at this point and I am not looking a 400 person lecture for a topic I'm not interested in. Basically what's a cool or interesting course that would be a good life experience to take before I graduate and all I get to do is commute to work and pay loans? I am looking into other options for credit such as internships and research but I wanna sign up for a class while I still have first pick due to credits :) Preferably course numbers too to avoid ambiguity. <eos> \n",

I could just wait until class and find out, but I'm too curious now - how many of our projects do we get to present? Is it only the really big one? Also, how does the \"Final job interview\" work? It says it's worth 15% which leads me to believe it's basically just an oral exam given individually by the TA's/professor.  Anything I didn't mention that you think is worth knowing would be great to hear too! <eos> \n",

It's nothing besides tagging Rutgers and the streets of New Brunswick with small stickers of Ron Swanson that look like [this]([url link] I've been giving them out to people since August, primarily in New Brunswick but to a bunch of friends at other schools around the country as well. I figured it's about time I posted something about it here.  So basically I've been ordering a bunch of stickers off of stickeryou.com - you can import the image there, and if you size it to 1 x 1.25 inches, you can fit 49 in a page. Each page is $8.99. I personally buy a bunch at once, and I have some now if anyone wants them. Otherwise, you can just order it off the website yourself, the cheapest shipping only takes a week and a half to get here.  If you want to participate, let me know, and send me photos of where you put the stickers. [Here]([url link] are some that have already been put up. <eos> \n",

My place is pretty small but that shouldn't matter. Building is *Riverside Towers, 10 Commercial Ave* Call (609) 473-0409, and someone will come let you in.

For my class, you just had to write and post some stuff on Sakai. Other classes run differently, but they all still seem relatively easy. - Atypical Development of Childhood and Adolescence (830:346). If you take it with Prof. McKenna, then you don't need to go to class. Just show up on the review session dates and you'll be fine. If you're a psych major, I recommend you take this as an elective. - Intro to Logic (730:201). I had Prof. Winterbottom, and he had a really awesome grading policy. Four exams, but if you do poorly on two of them, you can make them up at the end. Also, easy stuff if you're decent at math like proofs. What other easy classes are out there? <eos> \n",

So let's say my RBS scholarship is $6,000.  If I transfer from SAS to RBS, will I lose all scholarships, retain my $5000 SAS scholarship, or receive the $6,000 original RBS offer? Thanks for any help!! <eos> \n",

I'm walking all the way over to the hill center to catch a bus to CAC because busses aren't running to the stadium. I really don't think I want to make this walk every day.  Any other options?

As of now, I still haven’t gotten an email from the office, and they’re not at the bookstore either - apparently they’ve shipped already.  If that’s the case, then I don’t know why they’re not emailing me. Do they not put bookstore orders in the lockers or something? Should I go to the help desk at the local PO?  Tysm if you can give me a pointer! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Why are LX buses so hard to get into? Just took the first LX bus this Friday. I feel like this bus is not supposed to be crowded. All my friends in other campuses tell me how empty their buses are.  I went to the first stop on Livi and was the tenth one in line so I figured that I would get a wet seat at most and have decent breathing space. I'm just looking for a seat. The bus opens up and I was like WTF IS THIS? Literally all of the seats and space was taken. I email Rutgers after and I nicely say that the LX bus was super crowded and whether there was a extra bus or something. I'm always getting seats on the A bus and I always thank the bus driver. I just don't think the bus system is really fair since it doesn't give us a chance to get in. They email back just now like \"the buses are fine as is and it was just a busy day\". Fuck this school. I took buses on other campuses... it's not supposed to be this crowded. Also maybe if I didn't have to wait for people to get off first, I would actually be able to get onto the bus.  So whatever now I'm just super angry and want to rant. I just need a spot to get into the LX bus, but I feel like I'm stuck here. I know some friends who have had to commute because they never had a chance to get on the LX bus in time. Are buses really allowed to just keep you from going to the campus you want? I already feel like I've failed anyway <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If you or a loved one have ~~been diagnosed with mesothelioma~~ taken this class with Arnold Glass or are currently taking it, you should reach out to the Daily Targum. I did and I'm sure it would help their story to hear from anyone who's taken this class. I was honestly shocked reading the syllabus for this course and our tuition dollars shouldn't be wasted on people who clearly don't give a shit about their teaching. The policies are unethical and potentially illegal. [url link] You can email Christian Zapata the News Editor at news@dailytargum.com.

            "<bos> Just finished my first semester as a freshman and am planning on transferring into the business school (I'll be applying in the spring of my sophmore year). This semester I got a D in a class that I worked very hard for, but I'm guessing I was studying wrong, leading to my failure of 2 exams. When I got the exam I couldn't relate the concepts taught, to real life examples that were on the exam which caused me to fail miserably. I missed one class the whole semester and did every assignment but I just didn't have what it takes to get higher than a D. I know this is going to take a toll on my GPA, but have I ruined my chances to get into the business school? The class was fulfilling an SAS requirement and had nothing to do with the business school. I start taking Pre-Business classes next semester. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  <eos> \n",

I stupidly dropped analytical physics 1 for the fall semester because of scheduling issues and assumed I would take the class in the spring. Now I find out I can't take the class because it's not offered in the spring. So I can't finish analytical physics 1 or 2 or statics ( req. Analytical physics 1) which are requirements for first year electrical/computer engineers. I do plan on taking analytical physics 1 and 2 over the summer to catch up, but I won't be able to finish the statics requirement until the fall of next year. Is this okay?  Also not sure on which classes to take for the spring semester. The classes I am taking are: multivariable calculus / MATLAB/ lab for chemistry / micro econ .... Should I just take another required elective just for now since all the classes required for me in sophomore/junior year have a physics pre req or another class ? Thanks  <eos> \n",

Currently I am at RBS-N majoring in finance and while it is a nice small campus, there is no college life. Right now I have a 3.4 so I don't qualify for RBS-NB and they only allow you to apply for one school. Has anyone broken into FO roles in finance while majoring in Econ? I'm planning on majoring in Econ and minoring in stat. Thank you.  <eos> \n",

I only started taking Gen Bio and Gen chem this semester and I'm starting to realize I don't really have any passion or motivation to learn all of this stuff. I recently really got into investing with stocks, I mean at first It just started as just a hobby for fun and stuff, but now I feel like I'm really into all of this stuff in terms of researching companies and all that. I feel like I should major in finance now because I feel a lot more passionate about learning how to invest instead of doing science.

For those who have schizophrenic roommates or otherwise prefer to work in solitude, do you know of any nice public places for work/study (internet a plus, of course) that are open in the wee hours, after the libraries close? Computer centers or anything like that? Or do you guys just commit vagrancy outside of the church? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys. I applied for direct admission into the HA major. I have A's in the pre-reqs they require, but my GPA is only 2.53. I know that 2.5 is the required GPA, but I am not sure if mine will be enough for admission. I was previously accepted to RU, but had the worst semester (fall) of my life, and now I am trying to redeem myself. I will have 60 credits in July, after the one class I am taking via RU summer session. My portal was last updated 10 days ago, how long does it usually take them to make a decision? I am just really lovin' their program and my current school no longer meets my academic needs, there are no more classes left to take for my major.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Bert Goldberg, professor of social work and executive director of the Center for Leadership and Management at Rutgers, died this morning. He had been sick for quite a while, missing a couple of weeks of class last semester. It seemed he had recovered from his illness, but he fell ill again a couple of weeks ago, and passed away early this morning. The School of Social Work sent out this e-mail early this afternoon:  Dear MSW Students:   Dean Cathryn Potter released this statement this morning regarding the death of Bert Goldberg, one of the School’s faculty members.   *“It is with great sadness that I write to tell you of Bert's death early this morning.*   *He will be remembered among his colleagues as a wise and kind leader, dedicated to his students and to supporting the highest quality of leadership and management in social work. A true social worker, exemplifying the best of our profession.”*   Our sympathies and thoughts go to Bert’s family, colleagues, students, and friends.  Antoinette Farmer  Associate Dean of Academic Affairs   and  Arlene M. Hunter  Associate Dean Student Affairs I had Bert for two courses (one of which is this semester), and he was an awesome teacher, and all around great person. I know it's kind of cliché to talk about how passionate someone who recently passed was and all that...but it's so applicable here. Bert was so passionate about social work, management of human service organizations, and passing his knowledge on to us, his students. He was old school, he didn't want us to use electronics in class, but somehow, he really made this admittedly-kind-of-dull topic really easy to relate to, and you could tell he knew what he was talking about. He was stern, but fair, and all around...a great educator. I'm really going to miss Professor Goldberg. Our class will go on, but it won't be the same without him. Rutgers and the School of Social Work lost a really important man today. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So i'm struggling a lot in my data structures class and instead of minoring in comp sci I want to do something with ITI. my major is marketing, but in the future, I want to go into a webdesign type of field and I heard ITI would be good for that, except its only a major. The minor option I have is DCIM which im not really sure covers webdesign...sos. I've taken CS 111 and hopefully will pass CS112, do these cover any of the class requirements for a ITI major? Or will those classes just end up going to waste? Also, would double majoring in marketing and ITI be difficult or is ITI fairly easy? I'm a sophomore right now and I'm currently trying to schedule classes for spring semester.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey, my name’s Joey and I’m the promotions manager for Campus MovieFest. CMF is the world’s largest student film festival and it’s our 8th year coming to Rutgers. There’s a long legacy between CMF and Rutgers, so our team is really stoked about being here. Little run-down of what Campus MovieFest is: Pretty much what we do is go to campuses around the country and lend students video equipment (HD cameras, MacBooks w/ Adobe editing software, sound equipment, tripods, etc.), to make a 5 minute or less video in one week. You’re not obligated to use our equipment to participate, but it’s there for you to use if you’d like. It’s totally free to participate, all the equipment is free of charge. The only catch is that we want you to make a video about anything you want. Any topic, any genre, any idea, if you wanna make it, we wanna see it. Then we have a grand red carpet finale in Livingston Hall and showcase the Top 16 videos, the Top 4 go on to compete nationally for $150,000 worth of prizes. (The team that brings the most audience members also wins a drone.) We hand out all the equipment on Tuesday (3/28) in the Livingston Coffee House. We’ll be there from 12-5PM, so stop by at anytime and we'll hook you up with everything you need.  If you want to get hooked up with the website for more info and updates, here's the link: [url link]  If you have any questions, feel free to throw ‘em at me! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I am taking CS112 this semester, I didn't give it my all and have been cramming. I know I'll pass but I was thinking to retake it again next semester along with Comp Arch and Discrete 2. Will this be too much work? I can't take any gen ed requirements because I am already done with all that because of transferring form a community college. TLDR: Is it a bad idea to take 112, 211, 206 at the same time. <eos> \n",

I get along great with people who I know, but it’s just getting over the first hurdle of talking to people that seems impossible to do.  I don’t really like parties either, or if I go to a club meeting I feel out of place. I realize that this problem is mostly on me, I just wish there was advice I could follow. If anyone felt this way in the past, and overcame it what did you do? Thanks  <eos> \n",

And my dorm will be kicking me out for the break. That's it, and my question is to figure out how exactly emergency housing works, as I've heard of it from one of my friends.  I'd be quite glad to hear back. <eos> \n",

I'm expecting a shitload of people in this class and I checked the overview on the website. Just want to know if there's anything I need to know before going in. Also, are there any higher level classes besides this? Thanks everyone! Edit: The class is very tedious. However, go to office hours and take advantage of it to get an A.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello everyone. Terribly miserable here.  I'm currently a college freshman who just started my second semester at a university in Oklahoma. I was born and raised in New Jersey, but my family moved to OK about five years ago. There are several reasons why I wish to leave this school: 1. Never liked the state, just feel out of place. 2. Poor linguistics department (currently a linguistics major). 3. Poor CS ranking (I want to go into computational linguistics). 4. Lackluster music and culture scene. 5. Not connecting with the student body at all. 6. Overall, I am very unhappy and still really miss home. So far, this idea of transferring to RU (NB) was just something I dreamed about in class. But now, I really feel like I should start looking into making this happen. Here's what I know:  - Last semester GPA: 3.41 (17 credit hours)  - Currently taking 17 credit hours  - Declared as Linguistics major (possibly trying out a CS double major...?)  - Paying full tuition, no scholarships or loans (besides federal direct loans and the Pell Grant) My parents have agreed to pay for my first year here, and the tuition is quite reasonable considering our in-state tuition. However, I'm afraid I'll absolutely have to take out some loans to study at RU. Are there any students here who shared my circumstances? Did you make the transfer happen? What sort of steps did you take? How's the debt? Any scholarships? Was it worth it? I would like to transfer as soon as possible; is it feasible to enter as a sophomore this fall? <eos> \n",

If you've always wanted to learn how to knit, crochet, or do something creative this is the place to go. I'm always up for teaching someone something new. If you're working on a crafty project and want to spend some time with some other crafty folks while you're at it, this is also the place for you. I usually have a bag of needles, hooks, and yarn plus a few coloring sheets if you just want to relax and color. Hope to see you tonight! If you can't make it, join the facebook group to stay in the loop. Search for Manic Pixie Dream Purl on facebook.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello!  I am an incoming Honors College freshman in the SAS planning to study Computer Science. I will be attending an APA Day soon and was looking for any advice on which courses I should sign up for.  I really have no idea what to expect and the APA Day will be my first experience in dealing with college courses. I'm entirely unfamiliar with what courses are offered and what I should be taking.  As for my AP scores, I have a 4 and a 5 in US History and Human Geography, useless I'm assuming. I have a 3 on Calculus AB and Biology. That's about it. I took a programming course this past year however it was not an AP. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Again, I'm not knowledgeable whatsoever on available courses. I'm hoping an advisor will help me but I'd like to go in with some idea of what to choose / direction to head in. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Dear Captain Commons, There is an older gentleman often seen dining at the infamous, Brower Commons. He is typically spotted alone and in his usual business casual attire, which consists between a variation of different neutral colored sweaters and slacks. He is of the Asian race and has a friendly demeanor. There have been numerous incidents of him chit chatting with the Brower Common's workers -- It's safe to say that his regular dine-ins have caused him to bond with many of the staff members at B.C. As stated above, who is he? Might he be a student? TA? Or professor at this fine university? Has anyone had the honor of conversing with this lovely gentleman?  Sincerely, Enigma Chaser <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I saw a post on reddit long ago describing a \"Pokemon League Club\". I was wondering if anyone would want to start something similar at Rutgers. Here's the basic premise: There are 4-8 gym leaders around campus. On a Facebook page or something similar, the leaders would say where they are on a certain day or time of week. For example, \"I'm in the Busch Campus Center every Thursday from 10am-noon\". A challenger would look around that area for the gym leader and battle. If they win, they get a gym badge (it could be a sticker or something).  Depending on how many people are into it, there could even be an elite four and champion. The challenger that beats the champion, becomes the new champion- the next challenger must beat the new champion.  Obviously there are details that need to be worked out, but would anyone on reddit be down to help set this thing up? <eos> \n",

The name of the permit sounds like it's only Livi, but when I go to this link, [url link] it makes it sound like if you have a Zone L parking permit, you can park in any of those lots on any of those campuses. Not to mention, when I'm chosing a permit to buy it lists \"Zone C-Cook\" and \"Zone D-Douglass\" [like the zone coordinates with the campus name] which is why I'm confused.  I wouldn't be complaining if I had access to other campuses; I just don't want to think I have access, park on a different campus and then get a ticket. If someone could please clarify I would appreciate it. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I developed an iOS (Android coming soon) app that works with Sakai compatible universities and schools called [Universe]([url link] and noticed that Rutgers is using Sakai and didn't really have any mobile solutions out there yet, and loads of students were also having issues with Sakai.  While we wouldn't be able to solve the Sakai server issues, we're working on implementing offline modes and have already integrated Dropbox sync, allowing students to access their coursework even when Sakai is bugging out. Would students at Rutgers be keen for an app like this?  Any testers want to try out a beta version of the app compatible with Rutgers?  Could anyone put me in touch with the Rutgers Sakai department to get their blessing?   Disclaimer: Not from Rutgers, just want to make your online learning experience a bit better.  <eos> \n",

I have looked up deans on our university website but came across quite a few of them who are leading different fields/departments. I am not sure which dean I should pay a visit to obtain my letter.

            "<bos> Hello everyone. I am a Biology major set to graduate this May. I've realized that this is more or less a useless degree on its own. Fortunately, I took a few CS classes in my career, and was able to complete some prereqs, including all of the math ones, as well as sciences to complete the BS requirement. I could finish up the major in a 5th year, but it would be really tough and I don't know if I could make it out with my GPA intact. Here is my tentative schedule: **Fall:** Comp Arc Systems Prog Information/DB Mgmt Discrete 2 Graph Theory  **Spring:** OS Numerical Analysis DB systems (not sure if it's offered in spring, if not I will probably take software meth) Programming Languages Discrete/Probabilistic Models in Biology Is this just too much? I should mention that this will be my 5th year and most of my friends will be gone, so I don't really give a shit about having a social life over the semester. The way I figure, I can suffer for 28 weeks for a good job and life when I graduate. But I am afraid that this course load along with research that I plan on doing will not permit me to get at least a 3.5 (I plan on attending grad school at some point). Thoughts? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm interested in Rutgers, as the academics they offer plus the location seem to fit for me(haven't visited tho). However the low amount of OOS students are making me wonder(plus I could save a lot of time by not applying). Is Rutgers really worth it out of state, especially for engineering? How good is their eng program in terms of academics, coops, and job opportunities?   BTW I'm from southwestern Connecticut, so the location is not too big of an issue. Similar questions I've seen got a lot of answers like \"just go to ur own state school\" but the only good one in CT is UConn, and Rutgers seems better for engineering. Any suggestions?  TL;DR I'm from CT and I like Rutgers engineering but not sure its worth it. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Few things I'm trying to figure out. And please don't tell me to go to the office, I doubt they're answering emails over break. * Can you study abroad your senior year for the ENTIRE year and still graduate, assuming all your requirements are fulfilled? I think I read somewhere that your last semester must be completed at Rutgers but can't find anything concrete confirming this, * How important is your GPA in getting accepted into a program? Suggested for the program I'm interested in is a 3.0, as of last year I have only a 2.7 * If I don't manage to finish all my courses during my senior year abroad, how much does it suck to graduate a semester/year late (besides costing a shitload more money)?

Anyone else here who went through the same experience? Would this decision be too risky, given the fact that it's highly improbable I can return to pharmacy if I don't get into med school? I am aware of the PharmD/MD dual degree, but I already have a stronger desire to become a doctor rather than pharmacist at this point. <eos> \n",

I got straight As in Spanish through Spanish 4 my junior year, and haven't really used the language since.

Reading those threads is making me think twice though. Does anyone else have input/advice/experiences about RBS? Is cheating really that prevalent?

            "<bos> Computer science does not really interest me and I always had civil/environ. (CEE) engineering in my mind. Thing is I will have to start engineering next semester, my sophomore year if I switch. When I applied to Rutgers, I was accepted into SOE so I think it would be a straight transfer.  However, looking at the 4 year undergraduate schedule shown on degree navigator for CEE, there are quite a lot of required (engineering) courses for the first year and I obviously have not taken them, since I was leaning towards computer science before. What do I do? I have not taken the required chem/physics classes either. Is my only hope to take those required 1st year classes sophomore year since they are prerequisites and I need to fulfill them first to transfer to SOE? And obviously I'll be behind in the undergrad program so I guess I will have to do 20+ credits to catch up...? I really don't want to take an extra undergrad year/semester. Am i screwed? I have taken pretty none of the freshman classes required for SOE. TL;DR: I want to transfer to SOE from SAS but I haven't taken the required freshman engineering courses while being in SAS. Essentially, I will be very behind if I do transfer (unfortunate but I have changed my interests/major). What to do? Suggestions, advice? Talk to an advisor ASAP tomorrow?   <eos> \n",

I have a ton of assignments and a few exams coming up over the next five days and haven't gotten anywhere on doing the assignments or studying for the exams because I have apparently lost the ability to focus and concentrate. I just space out. And then when I finally realize that I've done nothing, I just lose it. I need help.

If so, is the curve decided by the average of all Gen. Psych classes or just the average of all your professor's Gen. Psych classes? The average for Steven's first 2 exams were both low 70s. <eos> \n",

I'm currently just directly plugging the coaxial cable from the wall to the television and it's pretty crappy.  Only other feature I want is I guess the ability to program the remote for one device to work with the other. I had a Samsung tuner back a couple years ago but for some reason it would separate the channels in a way that I'd have to change some setting in order to switch between certain sets of channels. <eos> \n",

I'm an undergrad senior and I was wondering, How do I ask a professor if I can take a graduate level course they're teaching next semester, if I don't currently have a class with them and they don't really respond to emails? Also, would it be okay if I ask a professor who I've never had if I can take their grad class? Thank you so much. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I'm posting this job listing here as a Rutgers grad who wants to reach back out to former school for some help with a CS type project. I estimate about 10-20 hours total on the project and I will pay between 30 and 35 dollars per hour depending on experience level. I can explain the project more in detail to interested candidates, but here's a high level overview. I want to track changes for a list of webpages and be notified as soon as possible when values change. For example, see the \"approve\" field on this site, which is currently 41.8 [url link]  I want to know immediately when this value changes and be alerted. There is already a Chrome extension (Distill) that loads the page every five seconds for changes, but I want to know even faster than that (ideally under a second). If interested, shoot me a DM with your contact information and we can go from there. All the best.  EDIT: if you're good there is potential for more work too in the future <eos> \n",

I'll be able to make the drive home some weekends, but the fact is most my time will be spent at Rutgers. Has anyone else done this? My girlfriend who is living at Rockoff right now says the school is pretty dead, and that New Brunswick is essentially a \"graveyard\". Above all, I want to get good grades in the (11 !) credits I'm cramming in, so hitting the library will be my number one priority. However, I'm sure I'll have a little free time too. Is there anything to do? Have any of you doing this met friends in your building or classes, or is it a pretty boring and lonely affair? <eos> \n",

I don't understand why it's there every time at the beginning of the commercial. It bothers me a lot because I'm a commuter so I study here a lot, and the commercial plays about like twice every ten minutes lmao <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was recently informed that there is not enough room in the dorms to place me.  Here is what I was emailed today:\"I am writing in reference to your recent application for on-campus housing at Rutgers University. We have experienced increased demand for on-campus housing and unfortunately, we do not have enough space to accommodate everyone who has applied. Since your application was in the last group received, you are one of the students for whom we can only provide temporary housing until we obtain additional cancellations. Temporary housing will be located in a small house that accommodates 16 students where groups of 2 transfer students of the same gender will be assigned into a private room. The house is equipped with a bathroom, a living room and a kitchen. There will be access to cable TV and internet and a Residence Life staff member will be assigned to your group to help you with your needs. You will receive a rebate of ½ of the daily cost of a regular room for each day that you live in the lounge. That rebate will be in the form of a credit placed on your account when you are assigned to a regular space. As we receive cancellations, we will move students from the house to a regular space in a residence hall room or apartment, in the order of application date. You will not be allowed to stay in the house if a regular space is available to you. We expect, but cannot guarantee, that we will be able to offer you a regular space before the end of the fall term. If you live close enough to commute from home, you can choose instead to remain on a waiting list until a space becomes available to you. Please contact us if you would like to take this option. Of course, if you so choose, we will also cancel your contract and return your deposit if you no longer are interested in housing. Im 23 and got accepted into SEBS school over the summer. I was really looking forward to having the dorming experience, but it seems like that wont happen now. As far as commenting goes, its an hour from me plus traffic so i'm going to try and avoid that option at all costs. Does anyone know of good places to lease or houses to rent? Im desperate now and will look into all suggestions.  Thanks <eos> \n",

We’ve managed to get some plugged in with some brute force, but there is one particular outlet that is in a very convenient spot that we can’t get anything plugged into. The outlets look like there’s something blocking where the two straight prongs go into, while the bottom prong is open. Are we dumb? Do we just not know how to plug things in? Is this worth putting in a maintenance request for? Pls help thank u <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Good evening everyone, Unfortunately I had a rough fall semester due to some circumstances that were out of my control. After registering for all of my classes and getting my housing info done, quitting my job, and taking out loans for this semester, Rutgers ended up notifying me today that my transfer admission was rescinded. I only received an email about a “status change”. All of my courses have been dropped and I have no access to any portals. I called admissions today and was told to send an appeal letter to the “question@rutgers.edu” email. I don’t know what to do at this point and I honestly just feel like dying. The semester starts on Tuesday and move-in day is this Sunday. Has anyone ever been successful with appealing a decision? Will they even care why my GPA went down or even consider the extenuating circumstances that I elaborated about in my email. I just don’t know what to do anymore.  <eos> \n",

From what I understand, in order to log in to our email account and see any mail, we log in using our netID@scarletmail.rutgers.edu email address, and any mail sent to the firstname.lastname@rutgers.edu email address (which we can't log into) would be forwarded to our scarletmail address. Is this correct?  Also, which email address do we enter if we want to take advantage of student discounts from things like Amazon Prime or Apple Music? Could I take advantage of these discounts right now even though I haven't enrolled in any classes yet? Thanks for reading. I know this post sounds really dumb, but I'm just a clueless freshman :P  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys, I am planning on attending Rutgers this coming fall as an in-state resident, and have some questions to ask. I originally planned to major in computer science, but now I do not know if that is feasible. I was accepted into SAS and CoE Honors programs, but they gave me quite the conflicting financial aid. SAS gave me a sum of $9000 with $2500 in a one-time grant with the rest of it loans. CoE was far more generous as I received two scholarships totaling $7500 with the same grant and loans, totaling $17000. With my current financial situation, it would be a burden to major in computer science with the lack of aid (although my mom would be willing to take on the loans, which I really do not want her to do). 1)\tWould I be able to transfer from computer engineering to computer science and (hopefully) do well enough to receive a scholarship of similar amount? 2)\tCan I take the required CS courses in my first year of engineering so that if the above is possible I will be able to graduate in four years? 3)\tOr is it possible to “transfer” my engineering scholarships to SAS so that I can get rid of this dilemma? 4)\tIs it feasible to double major in both CE and CS? 5)\tOr should I do what I do not want to do, and go into SAS the first year hoping that I earn enough in the future to pay back student loans? Thank you everyone!  <eos> \n",

I think all of those prefix.rutgers.edu email accounts are equivalent under Amazon's eyes. I also think that you can refer yourself for a free 10 bucks.

What would I want to know, and where would I want to go, to become further familiar with Rutgers on my trip tomorrow? Could I walk in and watch classes, or is that a terrible idea? Is there people I should talk to, places I should go, or areas I should be familiar with? In terms of what I'm interested in or my major, I'll end up in the general liberal arts family. Also, what is the general culture of Rutgers like? Is the more urban environment conducive to a variety of clubs?

My options for graduating include  A) continue on with managerial accounting this winter session, and take AIS over the summer. It's 9-12 five days a week. B) drop managerial and take both AIS and cost over the summer. I'm really leaning towards B, only because I'm pretty tired from this past semester (I earned my highest GPA yet), and class 5 days a week during winter break really is annoying. But then again, I'd feel kinda bad dropping managerial.  Any advice on what you guys would do? Thank you! <eos> \n",

Below I have summarized what this means exactly and how you should prepare for this transition.  Step 1: This means that you should go log onto webreg, deregister from ALL of your classes and stop attending class at Rutgers University.  Step 2: Next you should call the Penn State admissions office and tell them you are part of the Rutgers to Penn State transition group and that you would like to enroll at Penn State. They will likely seem confused and have no idea what you are talking about. This is OKAY. They are just joking.  Step 3: Remove all of your belongings from your Rutgers dorm/apartment and drive up to Penn State and find an empty room/classroom to put your stuff in. Again, Penn State students will likely have no idea what you are doing. Just like the admissions officers, they are just JOKING.  Step 4: Lastly, burn all your bridges/ties with rutgers staff and faculty because they are not part of the transition and will not be coming to Penn State with the rest of the students. Like everyone else, they will jokingly act confused. This is okay. You are better off without them.  Step 5: Now that you have enrolled at Penn State, you have successfully completed the transition. Welcome.  <eos> \n",

Also, to assume people have the same political ideologies as others just because \"they worked together\" or are \"friends\" is absurd.

            "<bos> Like the title says, I'm moving to New Jersey in August for grad school at Rutgers (Bloustein School). I've spent all my life in warm climates (Florida, South Carolina, Southern California, etc.) and I don't do particularly well in the cold. My most important concern is what do I do to prepare for the cold? How do I dress, what should I be mentally prepared for, etc. The other thing is where should I be looking to live? I'm planning to go car free so I ideally I would like to be walking/biking distance from Bloustein but it seems like most apartments near downtown are very expensive (I'm looking for $800/mo max for a room). I hear most grad students live in Highland Park and it's a little less hectic and a lot cheaper but I'm concerned about the commute. The Raritan Avenue bridge and the Memorial Parkway interchange look very hostile to bicycles from Google Maps and in the winter I don't really want to be out biking or walking a whole lot. Apparently there's a couple of NJT bus routes there but they don't run that frequently or that late. I could also live closer to the main campus where I can afford rent more and have an easier commute but students told me that the housing there is run down and the residents can get obnoxiously rowdy. Is there any advice you guys would have on making this decision? Besides that, what should I expect from living in the city? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I am mostly interested in getting a job behind the desk at a Computer Lab or Library. Does anyone know how much these jobs pay, what the hours are, and what exactly the job entails? It mostly seems as though it only requires sitting behind the desk and assisting people who come up and ask questions. Would I be able to do my own thing on the computer such as homework while I'm there and it's not busy? Thanks.  <eos> \n",

Problem is we’re 3 people so we can’t take a 1 bedroom and have to go with a 2 bedroom which normally houses 4 people. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do or where I could find affordable 2 bedroom apartments ?   <eos> \n",

Like... let's say I pick a Newell apartment (backup) but wait for an Easton Ave room to open up in the next few days until selection ends? Is that allowed? I'm super desperate because I pick in like 20 minutes and had a really good lottery number and my roommates and I really wanted Easton :( <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I transferred into Rutgers with an Associates of Science in Information System, but decided to major into CS at Rutgers to see how the program was. When I took CS111 class last semester, I did not really enjoy it. However I do want to work in the technology field, especially because I enjoy working with computers. Therefore, I am stuck between majoring into ITI with business as a minor, or BAIT. Any inputs?  Also, I have taken Information Systems at my community college and really enjoyed doing SQL systems, and HTML. Also, if I decide to take ITI program with business as a minor, it would take less time than BAIT. However, I read that the bait program is good. Therefore, I am not sure exactly which one to choose between BAIT or ITI with business as a minor, but willing to hear any inputs/advice! Thank you. Also, how are the work experiences between both majors? _________________ Side Notes: - Dont have to do any core requirements from SAS - 25 years old (harder competition for work experience) - Math is not my strong suit (didn't do well in calculus) - Enjoy working with SQL systems, database management, and HTML <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Im really concerned right now I got a 56 on the first exam (will be replaced by 78 from portion 1 of the final), 76 on the second exam (+4 extra credit points, so an 80), and a 56 on the third exam. The averages for the first and third were around 50s-60s, and for the second low 70s I think  My overall grade on the final was a 60, but I have 100s on almost all the online quizzes and homeworks and perfect attendance. How good is the curve? Do you think I can still pass?  <eos> \n",

However, I emailed them asking when the latest I could come was and they said 7/7:15. This is a problem because I get out of class at 8 and had intended to go for the last hour and a half of the program but now the registration closes before that. Thus, if I'm not there by that time my career knight privileges will be supsended. Does anyone know how long they are suspended for and what qualifies as a good reason to appeal? No where on the registration did it say that students MUST be there by 7/7:15. Thanks.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I will be a sophomore this fall and realized too late that I'm not fit for the pre-med route. I have a low GPA, a 2.4, and was wondering what are my chances of potentially being accepted to the Business school next year, my junior year? I'm interested in majoring in Accounting.  The thing is, I'm not great at math (I've heard accounting isn't heavily math focused, plus anyway I failed calc 1 first semester and barely - somehow - passed second semester with a C+) and looking at prereqs for eligibility of transferring is killing me. I'm terrified of the idea of taking precalc which is noted to have a 70% fail rate. Is it possible to take the 2 part precalc to satisfy the requirement? Would taking the 2 part put me at an disadvantage and be frowned upon come application time? Also, what is looked for in application? Do they care about extracurriculars because I hadn't been involved with anything last year and I feel like I can't do anything this year either mainly because I will be struggling a lot with math. I'm currently scheduled to take Intro to Macro, Intro to Micro, Intro to Financial Accounting, Precalc 115 and am also considering theater appreciation for the sake of a GPA booster. By the way, macro and micro will be taken back to back on a Monday in the same room and I was wondering if that would really screw me up. There aren't really any other open classes for the other requirements, so I guess I'd have to finish the other 2 spring semester and find some more GPA booster classes. I was wondering if it's wise for me to spend the entirety of this school on the business pre-reqs or not. Does it seem like I'm capable of doing so? Should I have a backup? I don't have any other interests and don't know what else to major in if I stay in SAS (my parents, for the record, are against the idea of me majoring in economics). Thank you to anyone with any input. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been going through a lot of personal things and have ended up with some poor circumstances -- nothing out of the ordinary, just enough to affect this semester. I may consider speaking to a counselor. I do have a brief history with Rutgers' counseling/psych services, though this time around, I don't suspect my mental health is a root cause of any specific problem. I've been planning to withdraw completely by next semester (already dropped a class earlier this semester), but at this point I have little incentive to stay. I already have a degree. But here's some things to note: I'm currently failing my classes, and it's past the 8th week withdrawal date. From what I could gather, if I withdraw completely at this point, I will receive something like an F, a U (unsatisfactory, which is the GPA-equivalent of an F), or perhaps something at the discretion of the professor for any given class. If that's the case, I'd rather fight to get a D for the sake of my GPA/transcript (though I'm not sure what looks worse, getting D's or withdrawing with good reason). These details are a bit fuzzy since some pages at Rutgers say slightly different things about how complete withdrawal works. If anyone has experience with withdrawing from Rutgers (well after the 8th week of the semester) and can chime in on the procedure, it would be appreciated. <eos> \n",

I've had long hair for like 4 years now. I'm going into my senior year and I know that the career fair is something I'm interested in going. But I'm worried about my hair being a hindrance to my overall appearance. Does anyone have any experience as a male going to the career fair with long hair tied up in a bun? How did potential employers view it? Is it something I should cut? I would really prefer to keep my hair long if possible for the time being. My hair is pretty neat in a bun, out of my eyes and tucked away. <eos> \n",

My GPA is pretty abysmal so I can’t rally apply for the RA program or arestry or anything of the sort.

            "<bos> Hey guys, so I had a few docs I needed to submit a while ago to get a my financial aid award letter. One of these documents was my parents 2016 tax return. I was told to edit this into my FAFSA but nothing was wrong so I just resubmitted it. It processed successfully again a week ago. However, even when I did so, I was still required to submit the doc, so I requested a transcript of the Tax Return and sent it in. Since then, my required docs page is empty but my financial aid reward status shows this: \"You are seeing this error message because: -you have not been awarded financial aid yet (continuing students will be awarded late June if all required documents are submitted), or -we were unable to match the SSN on your FAFSA with your admission application, or -you have recently registered for classes after officially leaving the university, or -you were an undergraduate student at Rutgers and are entering graduate school at Rutgers in the fall. For any further questions or to address any of the errors below, please contact the Office of Financial Aid.\" I am almost certain the last three bullets aren't what's wrong here. I tried called the office of financial aid and they told me to try redoing my FAFSA again to make sure I didn't get anything wrong. I know I didn't enter anything wrong so is there a problem that I should be worried about? Will I get my aid by just waiting? <eos> \n",

Its a stainless steel bottle with a red-is floral pattern, and the brand is 'Tal' If anyone picked it up by any chance I would seriously appreciate if you could hit me up!

How does this work with your fine institution? MSU usually reserves some spaces at home games for visitors, so I'm not sure if something similar happens with Rutgers as well.

            "<bos> Hey guys! I'm a computer engineering major, which I think means they've already automatically registered me for classes and such. I want to take data structures first semester though, since I got a 5 on the AP CS exam, and I don't think they would auto-register me for it. I was wondering how I could arrange this. Do I email someone? Do something during the first week of classes? (I hear there's an add-drop period, but is there a large chance that all the classes will be filled? Is there a financial fee for scheduling that late?) Also, I think I heard somewhere that Calc 1 is a pre-req, and I just took the AP test for that this May. I think I'll get a 4-5 though, so will that be a problem? Is it better to save the emailing (if any) until after I'm sure I got a 4-5?  Oh, and I'm in the Honors College. Does that complicate anything?  Sorry if that's too many questions. Thank you for your time.  <eos> \n",

My average is an 88 going into the final, but gradding on exams etc have been bit unfair in my opinion. Things like losing half credit on a 10 point question for one row operation being wrong (addition instead of subtraction) and a matlab assignment were directions were unclear about format of graphs and the claim was it would take to much time to regrade. Wondering if anyone took this class and remember if there was any kind of curve, even if there is a couple point curve give me a piece of mind. <eos> \n",

And on top of that I was a year behind in math until this year in which I'm in pre-calc( was in al 1 9th, and geometry 10, summer coursed al 2) [These]([url link] are my grades until 10th. That D in spanish will kill me right? Right now I'm doing good with classes like Honors Finance/Social Studies/Physics, Academic English, Advanced Precalc, and regular Bio and Art.  Next year I plan on Calculus, AP Government/Chem/Physics C seeing I meet the requirements just to name the important ones.  How fucked am I and what can I do to improve starting now. If I finish each class with at least(I will for sure go above this in my classes) a A-(90) to a B-(80) will it bring my GPA up to a good 3.5? (does rutgers take weighed or weighed) SAT scores are coming in, but what would a good score to get a surefire way in? How fucked am I guys, I don't want to turn Middlesex County College into my safety school. I'm very sorry for this long post, I've been thinking really hard at my future upon starting 11th grade.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I got wrecked by the last two managerial accounting exams  ended up with a D for the class. The business school website says a C or higher is required in all business classes to graduate. The grade isn't on myrutgers yet. Does anyone know if there's any hope at all in emailing an academic advisor to get credit for a D? I'm not asking for a C in the class, just the thought of retaking managerial is so dreadful to me.  I know it's not likely but I'm just hoping someone's had their D considered for credit in a business core class. Good luck on finals everyone! <eos> \n",

I've been taking generic pre-business requirements and some humanities classes. my schedule was very easy, but i did well in what i took. when i transfer to as sophomore year, i want to start taking more math classes. if i enjoy it, id ideally major in something associated with math. unfortunately, to even consider that track, i noticed that i've essentially taken 0 requirements for any math related major.i was placed into precalc 115 first semester and idiotically didn't register for calc this semester. what would be the best path to take my sophomore year if i'm interested in math/statistics/economics given my situation? should i consider enrolling in calc 151 over the summer to not be excessively behind next fall semester? i find more interest in statistics/economics as opposed to just math. it also seems like math would be much more difficult than the other two majors im considering. thanks for the help. if my general plan is completely off-track, please tell me how wrong i am!!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Two years ago, I had a Chinese roommate who told me about this bus that came on the weekends and shuttled students to the Asian Food Market in Piscataway. So I went with her one day. One of those short buses picked us up around noon on Saturday or Sunday at the Buell bus stop. Everyone on that bus was Asian. It dropped everyone off at the market, and when we finished shopping, we found it in the parking lot and it took us back to Rutgers. This bus is my white whale, and I would like to be whisked away again on a journey to the land of delicious Chinese food. Please help me find it.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So Calculus 135 is 605 total points and I got 91 on first exam which is 100 points and 71 on second which is also 100 points, with 100 on webassigns which is worth 75 points and 92 average on quizzes worth 75 points total. I calculated that in order to get a 90% in the class I have to get a 93.4% on the final (250 points). With this in mind, does anyone know from previous years or experience if they curve the exam grade or curve the final point count? For example 87-100 is an A etc. Any information regarding this is appreciated! <eos> \n",

I just got my first midterm grade back and I got 35/75 which is 10 points below the average. Till now, I got 60/60 on the first assignment and one 2/3 and two 3/3 for the recitation problems. I'm still looking to continue getting good grades for the assignments, but its the exams that scare me. For the first exam, I watched a few YouTube videos, did some of the problem sets and looked at a previous exam that my friend had. Please help me! What else can I do to get better? I really don't want a repeat of the same result for the second midterm and final. Am I really doomed for this class? <eos> \n",

I do have a car, but I'd like to sell it before I move up so somewhere with public transit, and walking distance to markets, etc. would be nice. I'm also married so finding somewhere safe is a big concern, and roommates aren't really an option.  I really don't have a problem with a commute up to 20 or 30 minutes to Newark - a convenient trip to NYC would be a nice bonus as well. Any help or advice would be really appreciated - even if it's just contact info for a decent broker in the area.  <eos> \n",

I need them to basically delete the credits for Pre-calc and take the Gen Bio 2 credits. I've spoken to a dean twice who said they'd take care of it, but they still haven't.

            "<bos> He posted this link on Twitter 20 minutes ago: [url link] \"The Rutgers IT department is a joke. This is the third time I have launched DDoS attacks against Rutgers, and every single time, the Rutgers infrastructure crumpled like a tin can under the heel of my boot. This is a surefire sign that somebody needs to be fired... The pure incompetence of the IT department just amazes me. They took a step in the right direction by hiring a DDoS mitigation provider, Incapsula, to assist them with the attacks. However, they ended up destroying connectivity and routes in the process. I did not launch any attacks on Tuesday. Why should I have? The inexperience and poor skills of the IT department ensured that I didn't need to. I sat here watching them foolishly attempt to fix the routing issues, withdrawing and appending routes (there were some instances when I laughed at what they tried to do). Anyway, good on you for finally realizing that you needed a DDoS mitigation provider! However, I'm guessing you went with a large company who offered you the lowest bid, because out of all the providers you chose, you picked Incapsula over Verisign and Prolexic... Incapsula is OK for protecting websites, not a university. Honestly, I am sitting here dumbfounded at the amount of incompetence displayed once again by the Rutgers IT department. I'm fairly certain I could run circles around all of you with my eyes closed, and one leg amputated... Just to show you the poor quality of Incapsula's network, I have gone ahead and decimated the Rutgers network (and parts of Incapsula), in the hopes that you will pick another provider that knows what they are doing. Furthermore, please fire all the people that made the decision to use Incapsula immidiately. Exfocus out\" <eos> \n",

I've only seen two of these guys so far, but there could be more of them, but anyway: spotted on the A bus the other day, they were dressed in all black-- windbreakers, dress pants, dress shoes, and ski hats-- and were emotionless, completely still and didn't speak to each other or anybody else.

I seen this guy at the SAC and at Scott Hall The man walks with short steps. He makes quiet child like noises (\"bahh bahh\") every now and then and to express thanks to people who give him money. This is for show to get you to pity him.  I live off campus and seen this guy talking on his cell phone in a parking lot (85 Easton ave) while I was walking home. I think he recognized me, since once we made eye contact, he promptly walked away and would not face me. He's not deaf or mute. He's a con man. This is a common [scam]([url link] elsewhere in the [world]([url link] He probably makes over $50 an hour preying on Rutgers students kindness and naivete.

Rutgers students should not have to deal with scammers at the bus stops and should be aware of such.  Don't feel bad for him and don't give him money.

Ideally, I'd like to spend less than $1000 on rent and utilities altogether, I definitely NEED my own room, and I'd really like to NOT be around undergraduates (no offense, just lots of studying for me not a lot of partying).  I've considered graduate housing but I'm wary about the $200 application fee especially and I'm confused about the single grad student floor plans. (As I've said, I can't share a room.)  I'm also wary of renting a house (due to current/past experiences with shitty landlords and botched repair jobs) so (again ideally...) I think I'd really like to be in apartment complex. Can anyone help me out? Any advice/info would be greatly appreciated.  I realize near is a relative term, i'd say within 10 miles of the Busch campus is what I'm shooting for.

I rarely had time to study for this exam because I am going through a lot of personal problems in my life right now.  However, during the last class, the professor said that even if you don't do well on the midterm exam tomorrow, you can bound back from a bad midterm grade by acing the final exam with a good grade. How realistic is this? If you have taken CS206 with Steiger in the past, what do you think I should do?

Also, going off on that-- if anyone can describe to me as to whether or not the gay culture is just an inflated version of high school (since gays don't generally get a normal high school experience) or if it's more lowkey, that's be really informative. Asking because I went to an arts high school where gay was a norm so essentially I haven't dealt with coming out or anything like the such for almost five years. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I received a grant for spring 2014, and it was there on my term bill until about yesterday when it disappeared. I got a letter saying I owed the amount of my grant a few weeks ago, and I got another one in the mail today. I had called RU about this about a week before and they said it was some clerical issue and what they saw was that the money was there. But now I got another letter marked March 11 saying I owed this. When I checked HESAA it says my status is \"Complete\".  I know when you take out loans, you have to sign a promissory note, but I haven't taken out any loans. Did I miss something or am I getting RU screwed? <eos> \n",

I was wondering what these classes are like, in terms of difficulty and what you actually learn. i know its all relative and probably depends on the professors teaching too but i am feeling kind of worried that I don't know what I'm getting myself into, or if i will actually like my classes. and lastly, how easy/hard is it to find internships as a student and jobs once you graduate?  <eos> \n",

I’m curious if anyone has theories, explanations, intuitions, or anything else about the high dust content as of recent. I would believe new constructions around campus may contribute.

I heard he doesn't allow calculators so it's more conceptual based, and that he's quite a tough grader. I unfortunately missed the last lecture (oct 4) before the exam cause I got sick so I don't know if he did any review problems in lecture or not (i don't have any friends in there lel), so if anyone had notes of that lecture that would be awesome too. thanks :) <eos> \n",

I don't know if it is too early to tell, but I can't seem to find any events for this year.

Basically, I was at a career fair specific to my major and I talked to this one company, applied, and just now got an interview for next week through Careerknight. I reserved the time, date, and everything.  If I'm understanding correctly, does this interview take place in the Career Services area of the Busch Campus Center? What's the process like when the application is through CareerKnight? It also said that I had to swipe in. I'm really new to this because this is my first time applying to a job through Careerknight.

Ok, quick backstory. a few nights ago while on my way back to my house after club meetings on college ave I unfortunately misplaced my wallet. It was a nice leather coach wallet that I have had for years and strived to take good care of and it is very important to me. Anyways, I had given it up for lost when I get an e-mail from Rutgers saying that someone turned in my wallet. Ecstatic at my good fortune I rush to the CA student center only to find that while someone had indeed returned a wallet with my IDs in it, it was not my wallet, it was a shitty velcro piece of shit about to fall apart. Now, there was also around 50 dollars missing from the wallet, but that I was honestly expecting and woulda happily given anyway as reward. The wallet switch is a huge insult to me though considering how much personal value that wallet had to me, I'd honestly wish they'd not turned anything in at all because I am so extremely frustrated now after getting my hopes up of getting it back. So here is the deal R/rutgers. If you can find my wallet, I will give you $200 cash (double the value of the wallet), it is that simple. Im not expecting you all to snoop around, but if you hear someone in your hall or a friend or w/e talking about a new wallet or they pull out a wallet that looks like this  [url link] then you could easily be $200 richer in the near future! heres the deal though, I also want to know who this person is because A. I'd like to make them face me down in person and admit what they did. But much more importantly B. I want to be sure that whoever is responsible for this does not get a bigger reward because they chose to be a shitty person and take the wallet rather than return it right away. So if you return the wallet but can't rat the person out (or if you are that very coward) then you only get 50 bucks, still worth it for about an hours worth of work tops <eos> \n",

How do people do well in this class, I just took exam 2 for it and I had to leave some of the problems blank because they're all so tedious and I dont have enough time to do all of them which was also the case for exam 1. I studied and practiced my ass off for this exam but i still felt I did less than average due to not having enough time to do all the questions.

            "<bos> Hello I am a senior in high school this year and am looking at colleges to apply to. At the moment Rutgers is at the top of my list followed by Northeastern. I live in Massachusetts so I will not get the In state tuition at Rutgers. Here's what put Rutgers at the top of my list - Size. Due to growing up in a small town and going to a small high school I've always wanted to go to a large college, the bigger the better. Just something different - Football. I like watching football games and I can imagine going to Rutgers games with friends to cheer on your team is a blast.  - Proximity to NYC and Philly. I go to concerts fairly often and being within an hour of both these cities is probably my favorite thing about Rutgers. If a band I want to see goes on tour, they will definitely stop at NYC, and often stop at Philly. This is great because I could pick a date to see, or possibly go to both shows if they are good.   The only thing I'm weary about is the 5 separate campus thing. Do you usually stay in one of them for all your classes, or do most people have to commute between them throughout the day? If so, how easy is traveling between them? Do the buses arrive on time?  Lastly I would just like to hear from current and former students about the school in general. Convince me either to go here, or not to go here. What's great about the school? What sucks about it? Is it a good choice or should I be choosing some other place?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all. I have received an acceptance letter from the Washington Center (TWC), for temporarily living and working at an internship in Washington, D.C over this following summer. While this is an extraordinary career opportunity - in that I will receive 9 academic credits (6 of which will go toward my Political Science major; it is one of the institutes that Rutgers and the Political Science Department officially collaborate with) and live and work at an internship in Washington, D.C., I am rather bashful of what to expect from this program and quite intimidated by the costs of said summer program (the total costs are approximately $10k, holy shit). So, for those who have applied to TWC and done all of this before: How was your living and internship experience in Washington, D.C. Is navigating your way through Washington, D.C. all by yourself something that can easily be overcome? How was your situation in regards to paying for the summer program? What were your sources of financial aid to fund for your participation in the program? And, finally, do you think it is all worth it in the end - for the academic, social, and professional experiences? Any insight into and advice for this would be highly appreciated. <eos> \n",

I was drinking at a party off college ave, and wasn't in the best state, but also wasn't trashed. Being me, I wanted to get a fat sandwich, so my DD waiting in the car as I went in the store to get it. Ordered 1 fat sandwich. I think it's normally like 8 bucks, and the guy rang me up for like 15. Being drunk, I agreed and then realized what I agreed too. Decided it was too late and just took the L. As I'm waiting for my sandwich, some guy walks in smoking a cigarette and then shakes hands with the owner and they start speaking in Arabic. The guy was SMOKING IN THE STORE. I was in shock so I took a picture for the snap, grabbed my sandwich and got out. Overall negative experience but I don't want them to get kicked out. I like their food, but this isn't the first time I heard of them ripping people off. <eos> \n",

But now honestly I'm starting to dislike my future suitemates and really don't want to live with them next semester. I currently live with them on livingston and we all became friends really quickly (we live on the same floor) but now I'm sick of them. I never even wanted to live on Busch to begin with but my lottery number wasn't great but in hindsight I could have easily gotten where I wanted. I never should have settled in the first place.  Is there anything I can do to change my housing now or would I have to wait till next year? I'm looking to live on college ave.  Also how is suite life in general? The only upside to living on Busch is that my classes are closer but thats it. I don't really fit in there. I'd rather live on college ave with more of my friends and people with similar interests.  <eos> \n",

It's a bit further away than my other options and certain parts of the street seems sketchy at night.

I have no desire to graduate from any of those right now as I want to major in Electrical Engineering.  I plan on following [this]([url link] ECE freshman schedule verbatim as if I were a engineering student. I know that I need special permission to take the intro engineering classes(how hard is that to get permission for). If I follow the freshman year schedule, get special permission for the 14.xxxxx intro engineering classes, and get a 2.5(the minimum for transfer, but I'm going for a 3.0+ regardless) will I get accepted come sophomore year? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys. So to make a long story short, this is my first year attending Rutgers New Brunswick. I need all the advice and help I can get regarding student loans. Basically, my first two years of community college were paid in full by my grandmother (only less than 2,000 per year). When deciding on Rutgers, my family and I filled out the FAFSA and a few other suggested forms. The results we got were: -No grants (free money) -$6,500 per year loan (subsidized and the other part unsubsidized) Based on my fathers income (115k+ a year) we didn't qualify for any free money. However, my parents have extreme financial difficulties right now between our three kids, sick family members, cars, expensive property, etc. My parents do everything for be but they simply cannot afford to pay for my school right now. I didn't have much time to act, so based on a relatives advice I quickly applied for a 24k per year private loan from HESAA and got it, because Rutgers costs about 30k per year. The other day I was reading into my loan agreement and I'm very scared. Considering I lost a whole semester when transferring classes I will most likely need to attend RU for 3 years total. A 90k loan with 8-9% interest is supposedly going to cost me 217k over 20 years :( What should I do? How can I go about getting actual financial aid, since I truly am in need of it? What are my best options for student loans? The thought of over 217k in loans is enough to make me want to drop out. Please help! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was told that the first part of financial accounting is the most difficult because its completely new stuff being taught, and then from there, it gets easier because its just minor new concepts growing upon what you learned the first part of the course. Is this true? I have my midterm exam 2 and I'm very concerned about it. I did fairly well on midterm exam 1 but I'm looking to see if the second exam will be easier, harder or about the same as the first one, generally speaking. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Can I take both, Math 252 - Elementary Differential Equations and Math 244 - Differential Equations for Engineering and Physics?? Or will they not let me do that.

            "<bos> So im a first year freshman and this is my first time signing up for courses. Next semester I kind of want to go a bit lighter and take classes that fulfill core credits. I'm a little confused because im taking calc 2 and intro to comp sci right now and do those fulfill any core credits? Also im currently taking rise and fall of sea change, which according to the easy sas core classes list, it'll fulfills 21c and NS. So making sure I get this right, for SAS, you need 6 credits of NS to graduate. That means I need to take another 3 credit NS class to finish those types of credits off right? Also, if there is a place to just look up a course and see what it fulfills, lemme know. Thanks!! <eos> \n",

Number one I thought we were protected under FERPA and number two I did not know that was even possible and allowed. Is it common for people to use the internet during these?

I have a couple really good friends but I feel like I need to branch out and meet more people, especially when all my friends are busy.

According to [this page]([url link] in the website, any visitor (as long as they're not a current student) can park at Lot 48 across the visitor center until 2 am... It's a bit silly to ask but there's no catch to this, right? I plan on visiting for almost the whole day (not overnight) and I'd rather park here than SEARS due to safety. I just want to know that I can park at the visitor center for several hours without thinking about somehow getting a ticket or any other bogus.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I signed up for a starter package recently and the trainer assigned to me was a little unprofessional/seemed unorganized. Is it normal for them to keep discouraging using other gyms on campuses because they want to work out on a specific campus (despite writing in the survey that you preferred a certain campus with certain times that have been conflicting with the trainer you were assigned to), or is it okay to think that, because I'm paying, there should be leeway for compromise? Sorry if this sounds like Im venting. I'm genuinely curious about this and how this has worked for others. Also, have you noticed a difference in results from working with a male fitness trainer as a girl and vice versa or was your trainer able to work with both? <eos> \n",

My medical problems affected my abilities and my GPA for the first semester and it was around a 3.2.

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm caught in a bit of a dilemma. My best friend asked me if I wanted to live with him, his girlfriend, as well as a mutual friend of ours in Rockoff for the 2014-2015 school year. I'm currently a junior and staying in the Livingston apartments- every single one of my classes from here on out will be on Livi because I'm in the Business School. If I move to Rockoff, I'll have to connect two busses or commute to get to the Business School every day which isn't terrible, but it's far less convenient than where I'm at now. I'm considering Rockoff because it's a guaranteed lease (whereas I'd have to rely on luck for Livi because of the lottery system). Rockoff is also almost exactly half the price of what I'm paying now, but is farther away from everything I need to get to. If there's anyone in here who has lived in Rockoff or just has an opinion on the matter, I appreciate any advice you can offer. He asked me to make a decision before the end of the week and I've been sitting on it, not being able to make up my mind. Some additional questions: How long does an average commute take (EE → SAC, LX → Livi Plaza)? How does guest parking work, since Rockoff has a private garage?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm taking Scientific  Technical Writing 302. The textbook we need is \"Scientific  Technical Writing Today\" 3rd edition by Magrino. For whatever reason, the edition I ordered online arrived today and guess what I got? The second edition. I already took off some of the stickers so I don't think I'll be returning it any time soon. So for anyone who's taken/is taking this class, can I still use this book, and are there any major differences? Obviously the page numbers are different so I can't follow what's listed on the agenda, but if there's any way I can still use this book for this class, I'd like to know. (Waiting on my professor to answer as of right now but would like your help). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I was supposed to take calc 135 during this 2nd summer session. I found out today that I can take another rbs prereq (micro) at my local county college instead of commuting down to New Brunswick. Upon attempting to drop, webreg told me that it was too late to drop through webreg itself. Apparently the deadline to drop with a 100% refund and no W was June 20th. So I had to fill out an appeal. I stated that I didn't have the time or money to commute for another summer session. My question is, if I filled out an appeal ~10 hours before the first class of the summer session even started, am I stuck with a 50% and a W? I understand that I should have looked into this sooner but between my current class, work, and looking into my local CC it didn't happen. That would be some serious bullshit it Rutgers takes 50% of my money/throws me a W. <eos> \n",

Because it doesn’t... it just makes you look like a classes asshole. Also.. For those of you who sit in the back of the bus with your backpacks on/leaning on the person next to you, did you not learn basic common courtesy/consideration for others? Do you think you OWN the seat? I legitimately want to know why people do this? Are you an asshole by nature and it’s just written in your personality or you think you’re some sort of rockstar? 🤔 <eos> \n",
            "<bos> hi i just had some questions for anyone who’s currently majoring/has majored in cell biology and neuroscience at ru.  1. why did you choose cbn over straight biology? 2. what campus are most of your classes on (busch, cook)? also what campus do you live on? 3. are you planning on going to med school? 4. alternatively, has cbn been a good major for you if you are doing/have done the pre med track? 5. (this may be a bit redundant but) have you done the ba/md program with the cbn major? if so, was it a good major for that program? 6. is cbn an “overwhelming” major for the pre med track? 7. do you consider cbn as a bio major or as a neuroscience major? 8. what classes would you recommend a freshman (who knows they want to major in cbn) to take? thanks in advance!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was walking over to the Grease Trucks from my apartment in Easton Ave Saturday at around 10:30 PM when these two kids approached me near the bus stop. They were my age and non-threatening so I thought they were just asking for directions. When I stopped they told me they were taking a survey, so I said sure, I was in no rush. That's when it got weird, they asked me if I had ever heard of the \"female version of God\", and then started talking about how if there is a father and son, there must be a mother. They asked me some other stuff too like if I lived on campus, if I believed in God, if I was busy that night, etc. It was a five minute conversation but near the end of it they started talking about how once the mother of God comes it'll \"fulfill the prophecy\" They wanted me to stop by for a half hour meeting at some house (I think they said it was on High street or something). I told them I couldn't but they kept pressing and asking if I could do it later in the week. I just kept saying I was busy and such. Then one of the guys says something about how important it is since \"the end is coming\". At this point I'm sufficiently weird-ed out so I started to walk away from the two and the one guy asks me for my contact information so they can text me about future meetings. I just told him I'd prefer not to and continued on my way to the Grease Trucks. Normally I ignore the crazies at the bus stops but for some reason these guys seemed like such normal college students it was difficult for me to believe what I was hearing. Just wondering if anyone else has had any similar encounters recently **** EDIT: After some Google searching, apparently it's a group called the \"World Mission Society Church of God\". They target college students. [url link] <eos> \n",

To my surprise, I get an email saying that one of sections that I knew was going to be added was open so I immediately plug the numbers into webreg and it worked. Now my only concern is that new section isn't showing up on the course schedule planner and I emailed the director and was told that new sections were going to be added at the end of the month or early may. Should I be concerned? Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what was the outcome? <eos> \n",

I haven't really been able to find any specifics, like if maybe the yellow lot will be open to residents in the apts, or if they are building a new lot for the apts, or what? Our websites are pretty terrible to navigate sometimes so I'm either not able to find the info correctly, or they just haven't released that info yet.. I guess i'm just curious if I'm going to hike all the way over to the livi resident lots that are already there, which would be kinda lame. Thanks <eos> \n",

Also all of my classes are on livingston and I am a business major with all of my earlier classes starting on livi. I am currently on Cook which makes the commute horrible especially for my 8:40 classes. So Im wondering how in the world do I go about changing rooms. I potentially have one friend who is in a normal dorm room, without a roommate, which would make things easier for me; but if he decides to keep his single and I dont have a specific room to switch into, how hard is it to change living arrangements? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am a Masters of Social Work student with 48 credits. I have to take two classes next semester and the semester after that to graduate.  Circumstances have made it so that I need to get the Health Insurance from Rutgers, ASAP. I had a stay in a hospital recently, and I need to see a doctor weekly, and attend an outpatient program to recover fully in order to get back to normal. Since the semester is almost over, I need to opt for the summer session's insurance.  I forgot to mention- I had insurance through a job that I lost in the last week of May. Rather than paying exorbitant about of money for COBRA to keep my shitty insurance that my shitty job gave me, I want to utilize Rutgers insurance, because it is pretty damn good. So, if I take at least 6 credits in the summer, I qualify. I literally have no classes left to take for my major. I am done next year. MY classes are only available in the fall and winter. Rather than put more work on myself and take difficult classes, I wanted to take classes that interest me. I signed up for the Cult Film in America class that I have seen advertised all over, but I was wondering if there were any other cool classes that I could take. Anything  on horror films? I LOVE horror films. I also like weird cult/exploitation films. Stuff like that. Other things that interest me are music production. Would love to have a formal class on that because I've been producing for years. <eos> \n",

If I get the minimum [requirements]([url link] will I be admitted in or do I have to go really above and beyond? Also is it competitive program to get into?  And question about the BA/BS. Will what I do in high school determine what degree I graduate with? I never took a AP science or a AP math(I'm in regular calculus now, so I'll have to take it again at rutgers), but will I still graduate with a BS as long as I get the requirements for the BS degree?  Quick question, ok if ignored. I'm self studying for the AP Comp sci test in May, waaay past admissions season, if I self report that can i skip CS111? Thanks <eos> \n",

The clubs I'm a part of now are kinda big and they meet really sporadically so I don't get to know anyone well enough. I was looking into clubs like the BJJ even though I have NO experience at all (tbh I'm kinda out of shape) and I think they already started a while ago. I like the fact that they meet often and you train together so that's cool. Are there any other clubs I should look into? Rutgers is so big there has to be more stuff. <eos> \n",

If I'm allowed to say so myself, I am a pretty formidable applicant on paper, and was hoping to get into an honors program and possibly receive some sort of First Year Scholarship award. However, I didn't realize that the deadline was December 1st and ended up applying late (about half way through December), which removes you from being eligible for any first year scholarship awards or honors programs. I understand that this is completely my fault, and I'm a complete moron for managing to miss the application deadlines, but is there any hope for me of receiving any sort of scholarships or eligibility for honors programs? If there is, is there anyone out there who can help me out? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> (Please don't make this about opinions, just trying to compare and contrast departmental attitudes so I can get a feeling for what to expect before I get myself into these classes)   PreCalc has a 55% fail rate. The first exam average is always 54%. The department is pretty much like \"lol oh well it's hard.\" Which is, whatever, everyone has an opinion, some people would say that it's a sign the school's doing something wrong. No comment. But it's pretty much way more intense than everywhere else, many very smart students are known to fail even ones considered good at math, even though it's a course that ppl take even if they aren't a STEM major.   Basically, are the departments of Physics, Chem, and then the class for Calc, all the same attitudes? Should I expect this experience in PreCalc to be the same in those other courses? (I am not asking if it is RIGOROUS. That's different. I am asking if it is the same sort of experience as I described above.)   Just want to plan my college experience and course schedules accordingly and know what to expect. <eos> \n",

So if anyone has experience living there, a pros, cons, and everything in between would be greatly appreciated! So far, a pro imo is that it is central campuswise, which is convenient because 2 of my roommates are on Busch often and myself and the 4th are on Cook/Douglass alot. The food close by is great, especially after living on Cook for 2 years where there isnt much food besides the dining hall and the occasional Grease Truck (probably one of the only few things I'll complain about Cook. Loved almost everything else about it).  Cons: potential cons seem to be noise, but I can make my way around that. I'm a deep sleeper anyway so I likely wont get bothered much either. Share anything and everything which you think is important I should know before living in Easton. Thanks! <eos> \n",

A couple of questions: 1) Would I be missing out on a huge opportunity by not getting the credits, making me ineligible to work in NYC. 2) If I wanted the credits, would I be able to get them at a different school? 3) Did you decide to take the extra classes? Why or why not? I'm just looking for general advice. Thanks! <eos> \n",

At this point, I'm really nervous on how I will succeed my first year without failing one or more classes because I heard Rutgers engineering is terribly hard.

Im planning on doing finance and want to get into IB, I chose SAS because I could also think of doing a dual major in Econ or Mathematics and Honors College kinda seemed attractive. But I recently got off UW\\-Madison waitlist and it is absolutely superior in rankings\\(#15 vs 80ish for RBS\\), I also really like the social scene at Wisconsin, but I was wondering whether the Honors College is still worth going for in my case? Also I'm an international if that makes a difference <eos> \n",

However, this year it has been consistently disappointing. There has been maybe 1 other day besides King neptune night where it has been good. I know the dining hall staff works hard, and it is a lot of work to feed so many people, but why has the quality gone down so much?  <eos> \n",

I moved into my dorm on saturday because I'm a transfer student, and my building is all upperclassmen so no one else moved in until Sunday. My roommate is nice, but we don't have too much in common and I can't see us being more than acquaintances. I haven't met anyone in my hall yet (everyone's door has been closed) but hopefully that'll change tonight since it's the first hall meeting. I've been talking to a few people in class and around, but it always just ends up being small talk. I'm trying not to get frustrated but it's hard. I'm planning on joining clubs this Friday at the activities fair thing so I hope that helps as well. I don't mean to sound whiny at all, I'm sorry if this comes off that way. I'm just looking for advice from other transfer students who went through the same thing. I knew it would be different from my small school, but I didn't think it would be so hard to make friends. also, if it helps, I swear I'm not super weird/a SAP. I consider myself to be a pretty outgoing, chill girl.  Thanks for any help! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Can anyone give me any advice? I want to be a civil engineer (Haven't actually declared it yet but this is one of the surest decisions I've ever had) and I'm interested in the 5-year master's program, but you know, life's kind of hard. I have a 3.5 GPA right now but I have some serious doubt I can keep that up for the next three years including this semester. What I am also curious in is minoring. I have credit for US History, Computer Science(The java class), and did General Psychology for a 100 level elective for H/SS. As of right now I'm not sure what to do for my other two higher level H/SS electives. I love history and psychology because they're easy and interesting to me so I'd love to take more I just don't know If I should specialize. So with minoring, I'm sort of unsure if I should try to get a minor because of all the added coursework that I have to take and I'm sort of just confused. If I can get an easy minor due to civil engineering in environmental science that would be nice. But I do feel that if I try to go for that master's in 5 years I will add an extreme amount of stress and would likely burden my grades so then a minor would be pointless. Can anyone help or give advice? <eos> \n",

I am thinking about taking cryptography but I have never taken math 300 or 477. I have taken discrete 2 in the CS department but it's not as extensive as math 477.

            "<bos> I am a Rutgers Alumn and current employee. Since the merger, my union has been renegotiating its contract with Rutgers. It had to be renegotiated because it was approved by UMDNJ, not Rutgers. Here is an update of our struggles: \"We met with management for the sixth time on Thursday, December 4th. In response to management’s continued pushing for their “Pre-Negotiations MOA”, we submitted a comprehensive proposal to align systems in a way that would be more acceptable to us. It provides tuition remission for employees and dependents, clarifies that there will be 17 holidays and personal days, reduces parking costs, ensures incumbent employees would not be required to pay back projection pay and allows us to challenge disciplines for time and attendance. Management rejected our position. There is a double standard when management claims to want to align the \"legacy\" systems yet continues to refuse to align other benefits like tuition and parking. Rutgers' refusal is even more infuriating in light of their recent tentative agreement with CIR, another UMDNJ Legacy union, that does provide tuition remission and reduced parking costs for interns and residents. They've added insult to injury by agreeing to provide those benefits to one UMDNJ Legacy union and deny it to others. Equally insulting is management's latest wage offer - only one tenth of a percent more per year than their previous offer for a total now of 1.2% a year.  Don't be surprised when management announces wage increases for the non-union employees shortly.  According to our sister unions from Rutgers, management has used this tactic in years past to lower expectations and divide the membership to pressure the negotiating committee into settling. Remember, there is a lot more at stake during these negotiations: issues like achieving respect and parity on par with Rutgers Legacy employees and protecting our job security. We're tired of being treated like second class employees.\" Thoughts? <eos> \n",

[url link] The first paragraph says I could be academically reviewed if my GPA is 2.0 or lower. But the academic probation paragraph specifically says that if my is lower than 2.0 I will be put on probation. So, there is a little difference.  [url link] This link says that graduation requirements is exactly a 2.0 and above. So I'm assuming, from these links, that as long as I don't have a 1.999 GPA or lower I wont be on probation.

            "<bos> \"Dear Registered Graduating Students:  Thank you very much for registering for Commencement. We are all looking forward to this joyous and historic event, in which the President of the United States will be speaking at a Rutgers commencement for the first time in our 250-year history. We know it will be a great day for all our graduates.  Because of the unprecedented number of requests for seating we have received over the course of this registration period, we will be utilizing a ticketing system, which is a change from past years. We will be providing each graduating student with one ticket for the graduate plus three guest tickets and one parking pass. The tickets will be barcoded and will not be transferrable. Ticket holders will be required to have photo identification, and all guests must have a ticket regardless of age. While the limit to three guests at the stadium is a change from past practice, it ensures that every graduating student from Rutgers University–New Brunswick and from Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences is accommodated. You have already registered for your parking pass, and will be notified when the ticket registration system is open.  Please be aware that Rutgers will be providing viewing sites at other venues—the College Avenue, Livingston, and Busch Student Centers, for example—for additional guests.  If you have not already made arrangements for your regalia, please do so immediately. All graduates must wear regalia to be on the field during Commencement.  We will be in touch with you during the week of May 9 with further logistical details about the event, including time of arrival and parking. In the meantime, you have our congratulations on your upcoming graduation and our best wishes as you complete your courses.  Sincerely,  Kimberlee Pastva Interim Secretary of the University \" <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys, So I just got accepted into the PhD program for Plant Biology at Rutgers - NB, and I am startled by the lack of funding I am looking at right now. Are there any PhD students have faced a similar challenge their first year here? I am going to apply for a teaching fellowship, but of course that will not be a guaranteed in for me and the professor I am hoping to work with is waiting on a grant which will provide an RA for me if it goes through.  Assuming both the RA and TA fall through, I imagine I will be rotating through labs. What happens then? Do I just go through my first year without any sort of assistance? It's too late to apply for the FAFSA (AFAIK for graduate students) and probably too late to apply to any fellowships/scholarships. I would have planned this better, but Rutgers was my safety net school and now I am wondering if it is even worth it to go now.  Hoping for some good news. Thanks guys.  <eos> \n",

Western Illinois mailed me my evaluation of credits without me even asking, but I haven't gotten anything from Rutgers (or any other college for that matter). I looked up advisers at Newark, but I only found ones for enrolled students. So I picked the one according to my last name and emailed her letting her know my situation and asked about transfer credit evaluations and how to go about getting one. She read it and didn't respond (I had read report request on my work email)... Even though I also said let me know if I was supposed to go about this a different way. So now I'm REALLY not sure what the best way to go about this is. I'm transferring from a community college so knowing what/how many credits will be taken is kind of important in my choice too. Any transfers out of state (or in state) know how to get their credits evaluated? I'm from Illinois, can't really just pop in for an appointment until I do visits haha. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I encourage everyone to subscribe to other college/university subs so that you can see the type of questions they have and issues they're dealing with. More importantly, if you pick nearby schools or better ranked schools you will be able to gauge their communication skills, areas of focus and academic/career aspirations. This will help you identify any favorable or important ideas or actions to integrate into your college life and academics. Remember, in 5 years or less these will be the people you will be working with or competing with in a work environment so it's important to keep an edge and be your best. As a side effect, you will make Rutgers proud! <eos> \n",

The Alexander Computer Labs aren't serviced during the summer, so can I not get this done, or is that different from the imaging services? EDIT: Just got a reply from imaging services, if anyone is interested: Our Summer Hours are Monday-Friday from 9am-5pm.  We no longer do comb binding; we've found our tape binding more effective.  It's $5.00 per binding.  If you've many things to be bound, it helps to give us a day or two notice, especially as we're in the busy season of hardcover graduate thesis binding.  I hope this helps!

            "<bos> I'm currently a freshman (going into sophomore year) at Montclair State University thinking about transferring to Rutgers Newark. Instead of living in the dorms for my 2nd year, I'm going to be communing from home firstly because I can't afford to get into too much student loan debt and secondly because I was always kind of homesick. I missed living at home and cooking my own food. A lot rutgers students, like in this thread from a month ago: [url link] say that Newark is a good school if you want to commute but not looking for the \"college experience\" because Newark doesn't have a real campus compared to New Brunswick. I know it won't be the same as dorming but I would like to still have a nice college experience. I also got accepted to New Brunswick but it would be too much of an inconvenience to commute there since I still don't have my license and it's too far away.  It would only take around 20mins to get to Rutgers Newark and around 1hr to get to Montclair by bus from where I live at. Montclair has a very nice campus but I also kind of miss downtown Newark too.  At least Newark admissions sent an email saying they extended the May 1st deadline so now I have a little more time to make a decision.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I've been stopped by this guy multiple times walking around Rutgers. Twice on Hamilton and once on Cook/Douglass. He's a black male and walks around in a big puffy jacket and his story is always exactly the same. He stops me and greets me. \"Hey. First of all, thank you very much for stopping. I've had a lot of trouble getting people to even stop so thank you.\" (offers handshake) \"You see, I have a Nissan here (points in some direction) and I need just a few dollars for gas to get back home. Anything at all can help.\" Except he's been stuck on campus for over a year now. The third time he did this I called him out on it. He didn't get offended or angry but just apologized and walked away. I've seen him stop people all throughout campus. I've had a few thoughts to tell the people he stops but didn't think it was justified since I didn't know his story, even if he was lying about his incredibly low mpg Nissan. Anyone have any more details on this guy? <eos> \n",

However, according to RMP, the professor that teaches it, Douglas Blair, is known to have a below average reputation for the course and other Economics/Political Science courses. So, I wanted to know if anyone on here has taken the course with him before and can share their thoughts with me on how it was, what mathematical models and proofs to expect, and what is the best way for prepare for it - to receive at least a B+. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just curious. I started at Rutgers back in Fall of 2009 - I remember DC++ being all the rage in on-campus housing. It truly was phenomenal. This was back before streaming was really widespread - i.e., no one had Netflix on their computers and Spotify was a word we hadn't heard yet. By the time I graduated in 2013, the streaming revolution was already in full force and I hadn't been living on-campus since freshman year.   Just wondering if DC++ has survived the streaming revolution. The nostalgic part of me would be a bit sad if it didn't. <eos> \n",

I don't know if this is enough credits or enough courses since it seems light and is only 12 credits. I got a 4 on my Calc AB exam in 11th grade so I placed out of the placement test. I also got a 30 on ACT reading/writing (whichever one got me exempt from englisb placement testing). I never took placement tests because I placed out of them. I sent my AP scores and my ACT to Rutgers many months ago. I looked on my profile a while ago and it says I have 7 undergraduate credits for AP calc and AP stats.

I can serve homes in Highland Park and New Brunswick. I charge $25 dollars per day for dog sitting which includes 2 half hour walks per day, 1 hour of petting and playing and feeding. If you need dog sitting for longer than a week I will give a discount. In addition to dogs I can take care of birds, reptiles, rodents, and cats. Each is $10 a day for feeding, watering, and an hour of care. I also give a multiple pet discount. I would be happy to alter the care schedule for a higher price dependant on the request.  Ask me for any odd job price, and let me know what dates you need me! <eos> \n",

I'm currently a junior going into my senior year and have pretty much all my core stuff done except for the math ones. The problem is I would rather pull out each of my finger nails with a pair of pliers than take any math courses. I've struggled with math my entire life, and even the thought of doing any form of it gives me anxiety. The only course I've ever failed in college was elementary algebra, that's how bad I am. However I was speaking with an adviser a couple months ago and she casually mentioned that there was a way to get around math requirements, but never elaborated. So my question to you is does anyone know if this is true and if so how would I go about it? Any advice is welcomed! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So if one decides to not waiver the insurance plan and instead pays for the RU health insurance, would they be fully covered for psychiatric visits at CAPS?  I recently just discovered my insurance (I'm on my parents' plan) doesn't cover psychiatric visits to CAPS. I've only had 2 appointments towards the end of this past spring semester and I owe about $750. To add to the blow, I also found out the handful of sessions I had spring 2016 were not covered and I owe roughly $1300. I don't think my parents know about this (nor paid for it yet !?) because its never been brought up (they only found out about my 2 sessions this year after checking the claims online ... which I only just finally had access to and was shocked after changing the date range to \"All available\" and finding out the mess from last spring lol). I think its too late for me to do anything about the charges from Spring 2016 ... I don't know what to do, but I'm terrified to bring it up with my parents.  I was always told by CAPS they accepted my insurance though but I got absolutely 0 coverage there; to compare I was only charged $10 for appointments at Hurtado. <eos> \n",

I have been doing good in exams but have been getting totally obliterated by the workshop quizzes, I really dont like how they are cumulative and I try hard to prepare for them but I do not do good.

I have priority registration, so I will have to register within the next week or two. But given I have a chronic medical condition, it's very important to me that I have nice professors who will be considerate of my circumstances. Good professors are more important to me than even my schedule (to an extent). Does anyone know when the teachers names will be put up or how I can find out (i.e. on the departments website)?

            "<bos> Hi, I will probably be a freshman next year at the Honors College. Part of the requirements of the honors program is to be proficient in a foreign language. I took Latin three years of high school, but I will likely be placed in elementary Latin I. Is it worth taking 4 semesters of Latin to fulfill the requirement or would it be better to take two semesters of \"French for Reading Knowledge \". I've honestly been terrible at foreign languages my whole life and have minimal interest in either Latin or French. I just want to be able to fulfill the requirement so I can get honors credit and hopefully end with an A in the class if possible.  <eos> \n",

I've read a ton about the major and the course offerings off of the program's and the American Studies Association's websites, but I'm looking for student input.  Few questions: Is it more of a cultural studies major, or is it interdisciplinary like it's advertised? Have you felt like you've learned or developed anything tangible (i.e. analytical thinking, writing skills, etc.) from this major? EDIT: Also, how are student class sizes? I know this is all subjective but again, I'm just looking for input. Hoping to minor in Middle Eastern Studies FWIW. Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I've found that I get super nervous and stressed around this time of year. I haven't been studying at all, and instead have been just trying to relax. Watching movies, going out to eat, sleeping a lot, etc... I figure I won't really learn much in the next day or two anyway, and I'd rather not stress myself out more by cramming. Does anyone actually use this method? Does it work for you? Am I making a terrible decision?  I'll update you guys after I get my grades back, to let you know if I was successful or not.  UPDATE (5/12): I passed all my classes (3 upper-level CS courses) with a 3.0 average! I didn’t study at all for finals, and kind of half-assed my final projects. I didn’t mention this in my initial post, but I worked pretty hard all semester (started slipping about 3-4 weeks out from finals). So, I didn’t do very well at the end but the preparation I had allowed me to still do okay overall. In conclusion, I’m satisfied with my performance and glad I passed, but it’s bitter-sweet. I know I could have done better if I studied and put more effort into my projects. Not studying at all for finals– I’ll give it a 3/10, wouldn’t recommend.  <eos> \n",

Looking at degree navigator, I see that I’m actually not getting any use of it and it doesn’t fulfill the requirement I need.  Is there any way I can drop this without getting a W? Can the dean of students help me with this? If I do drop it, does a W look really bad?  It’s a fairly easy class and should be a fairly easy A so it’s not a big deal if i have to take it, I’d just rather not take it if I don’t need it.  Thanks ! <eos> \n",

I've been studying alot for my other exams and feel like I'm killing it in those so far but I've been putting 0 effort towards this class (440:127) because I thought it was just one of those electives that's a breeze. Took the midterm the other day and absolutely bombed it (good chance I failed). I haven't been doing much of the HW either and the way the class works, the HW you miss is going to make the exams worth more. So what should I do? If I were to go max effort from this point on could I still get a good grade by the end of the semester? Or should I go a different route? <eos> \n",

I'm probably going to contact an RA and complain about them but first I had an idea. I have a reslife shirt and I was thinking about having some fun by putting it on and going up there to scare them by making them think reslife was at their door at 3am all pissed off. My question is, would I get in trouble for this by posing as a reslife employee, even if all I really do is tell them to keep it down? I just thought they would take it more seriously if I pretended I worked for the school than if I was just some random guy telling them to shut up. Any thoughts? <eos> \n",

I was able to drop an art class and add gen bio so I would have a pre req if I did decide to transfer to sebs, which I'm leaning towards. Is anyone here an EENR major? It's really sparked my interest and I wanted to hear others opinions of it. The only thing that intimidates me about the major is how credit intensive it is, and how I wouldn't really be able to take any classes not in that major, which is kind of important to me. any thoughts? environmental science/studies majors also welcome, as I said I really don't know what I want to do. <eos> \n",

All they want are pictures for some form of bragging rights or to get family acquaintances to stfu and know I graduated. I literally don't care though and I don't find this to be celebratory moment for me personally lol Anyway, deadline for registering is the 9th for RBS. Need to make some sort of decision soon. If there is no penalty though, then yeah I'd register and see how I feel the day of the ceremony. But I'm really trying to not attend. <eos> \n",

I'm really psyched and glad I got the position and I plan to accept the position, but I also just got an interview to be an LA next year. Given my schedule for next semester (below) would it actually be possible to handle both? I'm asking mainly because if it isn't, I'd rather inform the interviewers for the LA position that I'm unable to be an LA anymore so they can give the interview position to someone else. My schedule is: Electronic Devices Electronic Devices Lab Computer Architecture (ECE version) Computer Architecture Lab Software Methodology/Systems Programming (haven't decided yet) Without the LA position, my plan is to add in an easy humanity elective, however, I understand that the LA position requires you to take a 300 level course that also counts as a humanity.

Right now, I am still waiting for all the necessary paperwork to come in. All of the classes I am taking will transfer to SOE except for certain classes (they were required in my school for physics and chemistry). I am worried that I will have some issues with actually getting them into my new transcripts so I can take Calc III, 200 level physics, etc. I am also worried I won't get great housing and the financial aid won't be enough. I'm ok with taking out loans but I am super worried about having to take out the PLUS loan. Finally happy that I'll be a Scarlet Knight... just a year late! Any advice? <eos> \n",

My SAT scores (took it twice, once in May and again in November) are 540CR (Didn't change from May), 620M (90 point increase) and 600W (30 point increase, 9 on essay).

            "<bos> I've been going to NJIT for a year now, and am considering the switch for a few reasons. I plan to visit the CS department and career development center soon, to get more info from them. My main issue with NJIT is the professors. Most of them are foreigners, and some of them can barely speak English. I sometimes have to dumb down my grammar (basically, speak like an idiot) just to communicate with them. I feel like I'm paying $14k per year to be taught by the cheapest people that the school could hire. How does this compare to the professors at RutNewark? What is their stance on taking summer courses at Bergen Community College? NJIT allows it, but some of the \"equivalent credits\" requirements are in their favor. For example, it would take me 2 CS courses at Bergen to equal 1 CS course at NJIT. The general consensus seems to be that not only does Rutgers have a better CS program, but a better reputation overall. I'm not sure if this applies to every campus or just NB, though. From what I've read, campus life is about the same at both (boring). The biggest complaints that I hear about RutNewark are safety (moreso at night) and registration (they use something called WebReg, which is supposedly a pain to deal with). This post might make me look like a spoiled brat, but because RutNewark is right next door and about $4.5k cheaper (if the tuition page on their site is accurate), it's having me thinking, \"Why not?\" I figured I'd ask to see what this subreddit thinks (it does have 10x more subscribers than /r/NJTech, after all). Thanks for reading. <eos> \n",

I was just wondering how many people actually would be interested in being part of this possible club? Understand that it would start later in the fall semester because there are things to get in order, but with enough people and help, it can exist! Who's interested?

            "<bos> Hey guys. I'm currently a NJ High School Senior trying to figure out life. I got accepted into both SAS and SOE. I'm a little lost as to what I want to do specifically in the future. I know that it's going to be something related to computers. As to whether it's hardware or software, I don't know yet. Because of this, I'm also debating whether I should enroll in SOE or SAS (ECE vs CS) SOE has ECE which is basically a mix between EE and CS. I think that you get to meddle with both hardware and software. SAS has CS which I think is mostly just learning software side stuff. A friend advised me to choose SOE (ECE) because it was more versatile. Initially, I agreed with him. However, after doing some research, I found a lot of CE students complaining that the ECE classes pertaining to software were horrible and that they would recommend people to take CS substitutes. I don't know anything about about the classes pertaining to hardware. So for a student who does not know whether to learn about software or hardware, what should I choose? Are the things I read online about ECE true or are they outdated/false? I know all this is a bit general since I don't know how much I should write out but if you guys have any questions on the specifics, feel free to ask. <eos> \n",

I don't technically need to review it. I am just very paranoid and like to keep looking back at it to make sure I filled it out correctly. I feel like if this happened it means my housing application got screwed up and now I'm screwed out of housing. I don't know what to do. <eos> \n",

I found this on the ResNet FAQ: \"Please note that there can only be one device registered to the network per NetID - this means that if a student wishes to connect both a computer and a gaming console, they will need to register a router and then connect both devices to the router.\" So that just means I can't have my computer and PS4 connected to RUWireless at the same time right?

Do grad schools/med schools necessarily frown upon students who have taken organic chemistry during the summer? I will be taking some other courses to fulfill core reqs, so idk if that somewhat remedies the situation? Taking orgo either during the summer or the fall is necessary since I want to graduate on time. I also am super interested, as I feel that orgo will enhance my understanding of many bio concepts that I have learned; it's like connecting the dots, so to speak.  My other concern is \"transfer shock\"; while I am taking upper level bio electives at my cc, it seems that there will be a huge learning curve once I start. I will be taking other science classes, such as genetics, but my background in micro and cell bio have introduced me to a lot of the material. I have a pdf of the orgo textbook and will buy Boikess's principles book. Is it overkill to start studying for this class now? Halp <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I am taking Calc 152 this semester and I'm not sure how the final is going to go. If I end up having to take this class again, I will be taking it next semester. But I'm also registered for Discrete Structures (198:205) for which Calc 152 is a pre-req. What are the chances I can take Calc 152 as a co-requisite to Discrete in the event I have to take it again next semester? If I don't do this (or pass 152) I will be set back another semester, which would be a bad break because I ton of credits in the transfer process already.  <eos> \n",

I understand syllabi can change, but I'm sure not by much if it is taught by the same professor.

The rutgers website says that my score would give me elective credit but when i went to orientation, i was told by the dean of the english department or something that it was possible to skip expos if i had the credits from an equivalent IB course. I know you can with AP and stuff but with IB, I tried looking online but i couldn't find anywhere it said the IB equivalent class of expos. So i'm asking, does a 5 in IB Literature give me credit to skip expos? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey so I took out a loan but it doesn't cover my entire tuition so I was wondering whether my only option is to use the tuition payment plan. also I saw this written on the payment plan page, \"If your RUTPP contract does not appear on your term bill, print your student account summary, attach the email confirmation showing enrollment in RUTPP, and mail the form to the address indicated on your term bill by the due date. Failure to confirm your attendance could result in cancellation of registration.\" Does anyone know what this means? Is Rutgers basically telling me there's a chance I may be screwed over even if I did everything right? Any help is much appreciated! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all,  I am having some episodes of hyperventilation that are related to my anxiety and am looking to see a psychiatrist. I saw someone from Rutgers over a year ago but her next available appointment is at the end of the month. While I have booked the appointment I am looking to see if there are any other non Rutgers psychiatrists around this area that I can potentially book a sooner appointment with. I already see a psychologist once a week but when exam period rolls around I don't expect that I'd have mastered how to control my hyperventilation enough to do well in my classes. Need some extra help from medicine just in case. Thanks! <eos> \n",

As much as summertime in New Brunswick is pretty great (less people, more parking spaces, lazy days chilling on your porch) in my experience of three summers here there is also a rise in crime. Since there are less people around, it is easier to get away with stealing/mugging. Keep doors, **windows**, and cars locked, and always try to walk with a friend if you are walking anywhere at night. Have a great summer everyone and be safe. <eos> \n",

I'm an incoming freshman and I have extensive work experience in an IT related field, as well as a few software engineering projects that I have infrastructure in place to be distributed when I complete them. On top of this, I really enjoy networking and couldn't see myself working in software engineering in the long term. I'm a very strong math student and a competent programmer, but I'm just concerned that the CS workload could be too extensive for me to have the time to pursue my work on the side.  Should I suck it up and major in CS in order to guarantee I get a more respectable and sought after degree, or major in ITI and continue advancing my career while in college?  <eos> \n",

Now that I am graduating, I have no one to really connect to or talk to other than myself and I feel like I have no desire to move forward. I am accounting major with a 3.2 GPA and I know I will get a job eventually, but I could have turned out so much better if I just would have been in a relationship.

So, I have a couple questions that would be nice to have answered by people with actual experience at Rutgers since it's my #1 choice right now for a school. 1. Is it better to go to a two year school first and transfer? I've taken classes from community colleges through their high school program and people tend to keep to themselves (I'm introverted anyway) so that kind of sucks, but at the same time the tuition is going to be a LOT less, I know. 2. SAS SAT/GPA scores are a lot higher on the [.pdf]([url link] file on the admissions site than I thought they would be. Yet people seem to claim here that they've easily gotten in with scores in the low 1700s with an average GPA. I've got a 1790 (old SAT) with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and it would be nice to know my chances. I live in NJ fyi. 3. Does EC really count here? I know it doesn't hurt but at the same time I've only really done Boy Scouts. Eagle projects/rank requirements that required community service, that sort of thing. Thanks in advance for the answers. <eos> \n",

So far, I have taken Micro economics, and Calculus. I plan on taking Micro and Financial Accounting over the summer. If I do this I will only have to take Comp. Apps and Intro to Statistics for business. If I do not get into RBS after this semester I wont be able to take the Core business courses.  Basically, I'm asking u guys what the best thing for me to do is. Is there any way to take RBS classes when still in SAS <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Ask your curve questions here! If you don't already know, there's very little chance anyone can tell you with 100% confidence what your classes curve will be. This is because they vary from teacher to teacher, year to year, department to department, and most are based on overall performance. However, if it's reassurance you're looking for, come right in! I'm sure we're more than willing to share stories of what the curve was last semester / year if that helps at all. Or even how our finals went / our final grade to help determine if there was a curve to begin with. It also helps if you indicate your professor with your course number, as some are more lenient than others. <eos> \n",

I've been really stressed with Summer Session, so I haven't even really thought about Student Loans much until now. I need to make sure I have the money so I can attend next year.

Could someone please point me in the right direction? It'd really mean a lot. Thank you very much. <eos> \n",

What do you fine people do when your feeling this way? Also, I am the stereotypical poor college kid so I don't have much money. I was thinking of just taking the train up to NYC and just walking around or something like that. I've never been to NYC though, is this safe to navigate?

            "<bos> Hey all, I'm currently a Junior Comp Sci major at Rutgers and my little brother just got accepted into SAS and Mason Gross for Music Composition. I am of the mindset that he should attend SAS and work towards a degree that will make him money so he has the funds pursue his passion for music. And then at school he can join music clubs, make music-related friends, form bands, record and make songs, etc as extra-circular. He can even minor in Music Composition. He loves music, plays a huge array of instruments, and works extremely hard. I just fear that success in music needs more than just musical skills...you need entrepreneurial skills, self-marketing and network skills, and a lot of luck to even have a chance.  Considering he would be taking loans out to attend...do you think its worth it? I want to look out for him, but I don't want to crush his dreams and his passions.. <eos> \n",

None of my friends have heard of him, and I'm kind of a chicken to go by myself haha. It's tomorrow at RSC in the multipurpose room at 8pm. This is a throwaway account since I like my anonymity but I promise I'm nice, though maybe an eensy bit shy, but I'm friendly! I suppose either message me through pm or post here!  And from the site: Chris Hardwick, the man behind Nerdist Industries, the Nerdist podcast (one of the top ranked comedy podcasts on iTunes) and one of the 140 most influential people on Twitter according to Time, comes to campus as part of Rutgers' Geek Week. In a conversation moderated by rapper Adam Warrock, Hardwick will be discussing topics, advice and themes discussed in his book, The Nerdist Way. He will be signing copies of the book after the event. <eos> \n",

I'm determined to turn it around but I want to know if it's even worth it to try at this point. I received an 18 on the first midterm where the average was around a 36. I missed a bunch of the hw because of webassign but I am able to do them now. I am a sophomore. I'm in the school of business but have applied to transfer to SAS this semester so I can continue with a comp sci major. I would really like some advice on what I can do because I'm feeling extremely discouraged at the moment.  <eos> \n",

Please dont call me crazy or tell me to toughen it out because I have a medical condition that amplifies the cold in my body due to lack of circulation. So I really want to transfer someplace warm.

The first thing that I need is my own PC and I have some questions. 1 - Does CS department provide a PC for its graduate students and/or some kind of discounts? If yes I want to know more about these possible options. 2- I much prefer to choose my own parts instead of buying prepackaged PCs from companies such as Dell and HP. When I was looking at [url link] it seemed that they only supported these companies which is worrying. I want to know if I can build my own PC and still get the benefits from findtech or other possible discounts from CS. Really appreciate your help Edit: I received my answer from CS, it seems for my personal use I have to pay for my own PC from any shops that I want and should not hope for discounts! <eos> \n",

Unfortunately, three of the five people in my apartment are graduating this may but my friend and I want to keep the place for next year. So, we are looking for two people to room in a very spacious double. We'd prefer two females, but we might allow males if they are clean and nice! The apartment includes a washer and dryer, parking permits, one full bath, a kitchen and a living room. It's very close to Scott Hall and the rent is decent. It's about $560 for the residents in the double. Just message me if you are interested or have any questions! I can also post pictures if anyone wants to see what the double looks like. Thank you! Edit: Just to be clear, it's $560 each for the people in the double! Sorry if that was misleading! <eos> \n",

The REXL takes 4 turns to set up (like artillery) and has a lot of health but very little damage. It also has a 50% chance of killing itself (breaking down). Another unique unit would be Busch Geese. It functions as a reskin of a bomber and drop shit instead of bombs. Unique Attribute: RUScrew: It increases science in the capital by 20% but also reduces production by 20%. <eos> \n",

The suites are super antisocial though and I never had that traditional first year experience. I found I hated Busch and next year wanted to live in Hardenbergh Hall on College Ave. I know they have singles, but if I want the traditional dorm social atmosphere, is it worth it? TL;DR Never had traditional college dorm experience. Are singles in hardenbergh still social? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was initially admitted as a transfer student for the spring 2018 semester. Due to some extenuating circumstances, my gpa declined causing me to not fulfill my conditions of enrollment. I really want to attend RU-NB and was told to do another full-time semester my cc. One admissions counselor told me that doing very well in 12 credits worth of classes for one semester will remedy the situation and likely result in admission. Another one told me that it should be 18 credits in one semester. I'm confused. I usually hear of people taking 16 credits in one semester at most. I am only registered for 14 credits this semester, as that is truly all I can afford; I am reliant on fin aid. Will this lack of 4 credits hurt my application for the fall 2018 semester? If these grades are very good, given that they would be in 2 upper level major courses and 2 upper level electives, will they still reject me for not having 4 credits? How strict are they about this? I know this is kind of an unusual question, but I figure that possibly someone on this subreddit may have some input that admissions may not. Thanks for your time.  <eos> \n",

Though I haven't seen my exact room assignment despite my immunizations being received and checked green on the enrollment pathway, I know I'm living in B.E.S.T due to two of my seeming roommates requesting me on Facebook, yet I had to hit them up to find out why. Any case, while I would have rathered the Winkler Suites/RU-tv LLC, I'm pretty happy with B.E.S.T given that no one seems to be complaining about it and the rooms seem somewhat spacious according to some cell phone photos.  I was just curious about the particular pros and cons that may come with living there. Anything is appreciated, from quirks of the rooms, to the best places to eat in the area. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So during freshman year, I failed Calc 2 during the Spring semester. I didn't have the money to take it over the summer at Rutgers, but I still wanted the grade replaced, so I'm taking it Fall semester sophomore year. The entire course plan for Computer option just gets fucked because Physics 2A and Digital Logic Design require Calc 2 as a prereq, and principles of Electrical Engineering is a coreq with Calc 3. If anyone was in this situation, it'd help a lot to say what you did to still graduate on time. Whether this be SPN's or taking courses over the summer. Right now I registered for micro, calc 2, a 300+ humanities (all courses I need) and a bs course (env sci).

The story is kind of long but basically, I signed a contract to book a hall there three weeks n advance, but when my dad got laid off, I had to cancel the party because we could no longer pay for it. They asked that I pay in cash, so I didn't put down a deposit. We discussed that I would pay the deposit in the next couple of days, but after my dad got laid off, I never paid the deposit. I told them I was no longer interested, and they threatened to charge 50% to m credit card (I signed a credit card authorization form) the card got denied when they tried to charge it, and they just sent me an email threatening to pursue legal action if I don't pay the 50 percent....about $640. I read over the contract, and there is a clear statement that says in case of cancellation, I must pay 50%, but there is also another statement that says that the contract is valid when signed and when the deposit is paid. I understood that since I never paid the deposit, the contract was never valid. Anyway, that's the story, and now I would like to seek some legal advice to see where I stand.

The culmination of the course is a 30-page research paper, which is more or less the length of an undergraduate thesis to be completed in five weeks.

Christie that he plans to sign an executive order merging together the UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, UMDNJ School of Public Health, and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey with Rutgers University. I just escaped the RU screw for UMDNJ and it looks like I will be back on the banks soon. For those interested, this is what UMDNJ released to the press: \"In view of the UMDNJ Advisory Committee report released today, which is described as an interim report, we all need to carefully examine and understand the implications of the findings and recommendations for the entire UMDNJ community and its mission, as well as the broader medical and health care education and delivery system in New Jersey. Thus, we will take time to reflect on the recommendations and develop a response for the Advisory Committee. We will work collaboratively to ensure that we meet our responsibility to provide state-of-the-art care to patients throughout our statewide footprint; that best-in-class education is not disrupted and continues to be afforded to students in the health professions; and that cutting-edge research continues to advance the art and science of health care delivery. Within that framework we will build on the legacy of excellence in these three arenas that has been the collective contribution of our employees, students, patients and communities. We commit to vigorously promoting the mission of UMDNJ within whatever structural context is ultimately determined to be most consonant with that outcome. We will continue to work with the many stakeholders who are critical to that achievement. \"This Board recognizes that this interim report, and the process that continues forward, will be the subject of much dialogue among students, faculty, employees, alumni, elected officials and the public at large. As that dialogue ensues, we pledge to not only continue to participate fully and constructively but to remain steadfast in our pursuit of educational, research and health care excellence.\" Tl;dr: UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Public Health and the Cancer Institute of NJ may soon become a part of Rutgers and Gov.

I got to say, I wasn't expected my life to turn out this way. I was suffering from depression and socail anxiety from the beginning I entered. Despite being here for two year I haven't been to a single party or event and made very few friends. It severely affected my academics, as I barely did my homework and skipped weeks of lectures. This all culminated to me getting academically suspended for the 2017-2018 year which was supposed to be my junior year(luckily I got readmitted for summer). A good chunk of the very few friends I had ghosted me. Despite all of this, I was able to turn some things around. I got a 3.6 for a semester at Middlesex and have become more confident in myself when it come socializing. My question is if it possible for me to make things better when I come back this summer? Is it possible for me to have good set of friends (from the class of 2019) and actually have a good a college experience? Is there anything I can do right now about it? Is it too late? <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm going to be working part time during the semester and the easiest way for me to do this would be to connect to my company's VPN from school.

Basically it allows you to get food from places like chipotle, Taco Bell, and Starbucks delivered anywhere on campus. Right now it's pretty underutilized at rutgers, and I thought some of you guys might be interested. It's pretty sweet for like a rainy day or lazy Sunday.

On the housing application I requested college ave but i listed single room as least preferred so idk why they put me there. Either way, I do not like my dorm/building. My entire floor is anti-social upperclassmen in singles and the rest of the building is Freshman but they all hang out with each other and i nvr see them. So i was thinking about trying to go to the Douglass dorms/housing. But i want to know first, what is it like living there? Are the girls cliquey/bitchy? IS there diversity on douglass? One of my big complaints is there are barely any black people on college ave (mostly whites and asians), so i want a place with more diversity. Also, is it hard to switch into the douglass community? And as a transfer student would it be hard making friends there, especially if i request moving into a single room? (I kinda like singles now even though i didn't request it before).

I could take 12 and 12, but I am considering taking 15 and 9 instead. I'm not sure if I was doing the math correctly but I see full time tuition is $10,718.

I've been going right when I wake up (about 9 AM) but I figure that in order to eat something before going to the gym while I'm at Rutgers I'd have to go to the dining hall first and you wouldn't go there to just eat a quick snack before the gym.

My lease ends May 30th and you can move in as early as Dec 22nd. Room for rent in a three bedroom house. $488/month. The medium size kitchen has a dishwasher, plenty of counter and fridge space. We have a large, furnished living room. There is plenty of storage space between the basement and attic. In the basement is a washer and dryer that we share with our three downstairs neighbors. The house is a short, ten minute walk from downtown New Brunswick and the train station. We located in a quiet neighborhood with driveway parking, in addition to ample street parking.

My plan is to meet every Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Alexander Library (reserved room) on College Ave. I'm creating this group knowing that there are many who want to learn the Japanese language; but I also realize that many don't have the time, means, or resources to accomplish that goal.  **What you will learn:** • Japanese writing systems (hiragana, katakana, and some kanji) • Common phrases, conversational skills, vocabulary, and reading • Culture points **What to Expect:** • 1-2-hours of direct, friendly instruction • In-class and take-home handouts to assist in learning • Speaking and writing in every class  **About me:** I'm a Japanese 102 student with teaching experience. Though my goal is to help others learn, I'm also doing this to enhance my own understanding of Japanese. Though I am a mere 102 student, I feel I have a strong grasp of the basics; however, it's because I'm just a 102 that I'm only reaching out to beginners. Also note that you can practice Japanese at the Japanese Conversation Club (JCC).  If interested, please inbox me.

He said it's bad, even if it's good like Ernesto school of pharmacy which is ranked #30. Is pharmacy really dying, or is he just scaring me?

I got a Turnitin error through sakai where it wouldn\\'t rate my paper\\'s similarity percentage, so I emailed my paper to my Professor. Professor says she refuses to grade anything not sent through Turnitin - fine. I try submitting the paper a variety of different ways and failed, so finally she somehow to submitted it through what she said was a \"backdoor\" of Turnitin. I used a lot of quotes in my paper, and my similarity came up as 34% (although they were properly cited). Professor asked me to revise my paper and the Turnitin percentage must be 15% or less to not receive a point deduction. I revised my paper, removed all quotes to try to avoid any problems with Turnitin, and emailed it to her after she said she would rerun it through Turnitin and let me know the percentage. She never emailed me back, and finally I get a notification through Sakai that I received my grade back - 15 points were deducted from my paper grade with the explanation that she was \"Unable to verify similarity percentage.\" I emailed her asking what happened, because she assured me she would run it through Turnitin on her end since I was unable to. She replied:  \"I ran the final copy through my \"back door\" to Turnitin (not the through the class Sakai site).... and the similarity index is 85%.... However, it is impossible to tell how much of that is due to the similarity to your first submission...which the sakai help desk submitted through THEIR back door.... but it all goes into the same data base.\" So I received a 15 point deduction because Turnitin may have related my paper to... my own paper. Instead of a 90, I received a 75. Should I bother appealing this? My grade in the class is a B+, would have been an A without this point deduction. I\\'m not upset about my final grade necessarily, just about the fact that I received a major point deduction for what may have been just a similarity to my own first submission. What would you do in this situation? I\\'m wondering if it\\'s worth making a big deal over. tl;dr: Turnitin said my paper was too similar to other sources. I resubmitted a revised draft which received a higher similarity percentage. Professor isn\\'t sure if new higher Turnitin similarity is relating my revised paper to my own original draft - deducted 15 points from my paper grade.

It's been so hard making friends in my dorm - I live on Douglass in all female housing, and no one ever leaves their rooms.

Does college ave have dorms where it's mostly upperclassmen, or at least sophomore +? Are they social, open? Would it be weird to live there as a junior? Would reverse seniority points not let me live there anyway?  I'd just really like to have more friends, it's getting depressing.

A few months back at the end of last semester, I made [this post]([url link] on /r/rutgers explaining my current situation of loneliness and letting myself get very isolated and depressed. I’m doing okay now, I’m feeling mostly the same but seeing more reason to believe things might be able to get better for myself, I don’t really know. Anyway, as I said in my original post, I want to try to see if I can turn things around for myself in my last year here, and one way to potentially do that is through clubs. Only problem is of course I’m already a senior, making it a bit of an awkward place to start. Basically what I’m asking is if it’s realistic to make strong connections and relationships with people through clubs this late in the game (I’m sure the answer is yes, but I guess I’d just like to hear reassurance or success stories if anyone has them) and if I might be able to have the experiences I was hoping to have in just one year.

My dad is full time and mom is receiving unemployment benefits (around 1/5 of her actual income) at the moment. I haven't gotten my financial aid letter for 2016-2017 yet, but i did see my NJ TAG and it has dropped significantly (probably because the income was higher in 2015 than in 2014).

She didn't tell me anything else.

That said, there will be polling locations at the LSC and the BCC, as well as the Lincoln School on Bartlett St. Here's the source: [url link] If you are registered in New Brunswick or Piscataway, you can find out where your polling location is here: [url link] If you're registered in the city New Brunswick, you should still go to your assigned polling location. There is a question on the ballot - Municipal Question 1 - that allows for the New Brunswick school board to be democratically elected rather than be appointed by Mayor Cahill, New Brunswick's super corrupt mayor who has been in office for 22 years. Vote YES on Municipal Question 1 to end political patronage in New Brunswick schools! [url link] Also, REALLY IMPORTANT THING! PLEASE vote YES on State Question 1 - the Building Our Future Bond Act! What this means is that the state will open up $750 mil in state bonds, and the revenues generated will be going towards building CLASSROOM BUILDINGS and RESEARCH FACILITIES in all the public colleges in New Jersey with almost no dent to the NJ taxpayer's pocket.

He emails back just now like “the chicken is fine, chew more next time”. Fuck this guy. I ate chicken my senior year…it’s not supposed to be this hard. Also maybe if I didn’t have to buy the 210 meal plan, I would actually be able to buy some edible chicken and eat. So whatever now I’m just super angry and want to rant. I just need some edible chicken to get into my stomach, but I feel like I got a solid stomach ulcer. I know some friends who have had to run to the hospital because they ate Brower chicken twice and their stomach wouldn’t even let them shit it out. Is Deba Dutta really allowed to just keep you from eating edible chicken? I already feel like I’ve failed anyway.

I have tried to ask random people in my class if they are interested in selling the code that came with their new iClicker.

Therefore, if you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or have anything related to sniper.rutgers.io please feel free to PM me here or send an email to course.sniper.dev@gmail.com. Now that introductions are out of the way... I apologize for any inconvenience that you might have had with course sniper over the last few days. As I have just recently been handed the code I am gradually getting a handle on it so I am sorry for the growing pains. I realized that there were some issues in the past few days, such as the site not being up and people receiving the incorrect index number. I have corrected both of these issues and it should be functioning as expected. As for the index number issue, I accidentally set the incorrect semester but that should be fixed now. I will be more diligent in the future. Once again, please feel free to PM me or comment on this post if you have comments, questions, or concerns regarding course sniper.

If you're involved in Greek life and you just finished another epic night of partying and have to deal with a sea of red cups, cigarette butts, vomit, and pizza boxes, just let us know! We're all students too, so we know how things can get. I also offer post-party deliveries of hangover drinks like Gatorade, Snapple, bottled water, and all manner of breakfast items. Again, PM to work out details! I am now taking reservations for move-in assistance. Beds, headboards, dressers, desks, boxes, boxes, and more boxes: whatever you need moved, we can help. We also do furniture assembly (for all the those Ikea fans) and trash removal, so when you're done with your cardboard boxes and packing paper, we can bag it and haul it. If you're interested in any of these services (or something else you think we may be able to help with), send me a PM. We are affordable, reliable, professional, and college students just like you.

At this point I am very very likely to come to the Newark campus this fall as a doctoral student in the business school. I currently live in the south and know almost nothing about Newark/NJ. I came to the experts to get some housing advice. I will be living by myself (no roommates) and am looking for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment/condo/townhome to rent in a very safe area. Distance is not a huge deal, I will have a car and reserved parking, so I'm ok with up to a 45 min commute each way. I also am interested in being in a more suburban setting if possible, but I realize it may not be. I have heard Montclair, NJ might be more suburban, but I really don't know.  Close parking, A/C, dishwasher, and in-unit washer/dryer are all must have features. I don't care about having a pool/gym/hot tub or anything like that.

For example, last year during Irene I parked in Douglass Deck (was worried that my apartment parking lot would flood), was parked there for 2 or 3 days and didn't get a ticket.. so I guess as far as cars go, I'd suggest parking in one of the decks to make sure your car doesn't get flooded. RUPD doesn't ticket much during rain to begin with, so it should not be an issue. Also, uh, eat everything perishable... personally, because of Irene we had no power for 4 days (on-campus apartment on C/D) and all of our fridge/frozen food went bad.

This connection can be described as a direction of hope for the people trapped by isolating conditions as a governing theme of this event. Our event will feature Professor Alex Hinton, the Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Genocide, Conflict Resolution, and Human Rights at Rutgers Newark, Professor Elizabeth Amaya Fernadez from Rutgers Health Services, and a speaker from the organization Irate. The event will also include our second annual em[POWER] Students for Service competition, where one group of Rutgers students will be awarded a cash prize to help them accomplish their community development project! --------------------------------------------------------- A full dinner will be served for free as a courtesy to our guests, but any donation you wish to contribute to both organizations will be greatly appreciated.

It's a 2BR apartment with a shared living room, kitchen, and bathroom. I am renting out one of the bedrooms so you would have your own personal space. The only utilities we pay for are electric/gas and cable. There are no parking rules (no permits, assigned spaces, etc.). It's a 20 minute walk to the College Ave. campus and the Easton Ave. bars (I did this walk for 2 years and it was no problem). Rent is about $615 per month and security deposit is $925. First month's rent and security deposit is due on 7/25/14 at the latest (and I'd like to have to it sent in earlier than that). I'm pretty easy-going and laid back and I'm looking for someone who is basically the same way. I just graduated with my masters and I'll be working full-time by the time the place is ready to be rented out, so someone who is in school is fine but working people are OK too.

Bc of that really bad fall semester, they revoked my admission. My spring semester was good for the most part, but I had one D on my transcript. I just finished a class at RU, I’m finishing up a class at my CC and the grades for those two should be out by this week. I am taking another class at ru rn, but that doesn’t end til August 2nd . Right now I only have 6 new credits from the summer and the 14 from spring since my app was last reviewed by SAS and SEBS. I want to apply to RU (for fall 2018) next week bc they are still talking applications. I want to wait until August bc admissions told me the more credits the better for reconsideration. However I’m worried that there will be no space by August.  I really can’t do another semester at my CC. I have no more financial aid bc I was only given it for 4 semesters. I’ve taken all of the classes offered in my major, so things are exhausted. I have been working full time all summer to not only pay for these classes that I’ve been taking as a visiting student, but to also help out with paying for bills and monthly mortgage payments. I’m only 19 and everything is always going downhill. I don’t want to be told to wait do another year at CC bc I don’t have that option.

The first exam didn't seem too hard, but a lot of the questions were questions I was unfamiliar with as they weren't similar to the practice exam and homework. I thought of the practice exam and HW easy, but the actual exam was an entire new world. I later talked to people who did well, and I realized that one of the biggest misses I did when studying was not doing any practice problems from the textbook/syllabus. I already have a fairly heavy courseload (Discrete 1, Comp Arch and Intro to Linear Algebra). If i were to take 133, I would be able to have a lot of stress out of mind. At the same time, I also didn't even do well on my first exam for Discrete as well, meaning I also have another class i'm panicking about. All of this stress and work is even preventing me from focusing on applying for internships. My GPA isn't so hot (about a 2.9), and i'm trying to use this semester to help increase it. But i'm wondering if Chem 133 is really worth it to miss out my chance to finish up Chem 161 and move on to Chem 162. I can also reconsider about taking physics if I do make this decision. I know about the Final Exam Replacement Rule and having to attend remediaton, but there's a strong risk if I decide to stay. So for those of you who have taken 133, how efficient was it when you retook Chem 161? And for everyone, what do you believe is my best decision? Should I go for 133 and make my life easier, or attempt take the risk of taking remediation and hope that I do well for the rest of the course? <eos> \", \"<bos> i'm just wondering, if the second half of bio 116 (after all the classification stuff) is a decent background for systems? i'm taking systems next year and i have no experience with it lol <eos> \", '<bos> my friends and i were looking to sign a house on duke st is it too dangerous? <eos> ', \"<bos> I've got a Silver Lot Pass and I know what you're thinking, what could be more exciting than partying out by the Rutgers Federal Credit Union...

The major I was planning on declaring was cell biology and neuroscience, but this is a Bachelor of Arts degree even though the curriculum is identical to what you would do at most other universities for a Bachelor of Science. Am I missing something? Looking at majors for Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Genetics, and many other 'science' fields SAS awards only bachelor of arts although the courses you have to take are the same as everywhere else where you would get a BSc.

I've recently added push notifications to my NJ Rails app and would like to extract the push of that into a stand alone app.  The new app will be a combination of news and entertainment events that are pushed to your phone in real time (the only delay is networking io and database queries). Here is how it works: We keep a stream open to twitter listening for tweets from accounts we have approved. We query the user's preferences to see if they want to receive that alert. We push the alert out.  I have been testing this for a few weeks now and I want more data being pushed to my phone. However, I have limited time and need some help curating lists and in some instances manually pushing news. I'm gauging if there is any interest for others to collaborate on this with me.

All my assignments for the week are done, I have yet to join any clubs, I honestly have no clue what to do and I don't want to sit in my dorm watching Netflix all weekend. I'm not really the partying type, I don't feel like I'd fit in with that crowd if I tried and I don't really have enough friends here yet to feel comfortable going out on the town, so I'm at a loss for how to fill my weekends. I don't wanna be the guy who goes home every weekend, because that's terribly boring.

I'm an older transfer (25) who's about to graduate and felt quite apathetic about making friends here. Mostly due to the age gap and the fact that most social circles were established by the time I got here. However, I know I'm not alone and if there are any transfers or anyone out there who's been on the same boat I'd like to organize a meetup at a BAR some time next week. I know the past few reddit meetups here have been awkward as fuck, which is why I'm chosing for it to be at a bar. I'm thinking Stuff Yet Face since you don't have to be 21 to get in.

I'm currently on the verge of finishing my Associates at CC but I withdrew from Calculus 2, which would be the last class I need to finish my degree. While I breezed through CC with a 3.97 GPA, Calc 2 was the only class that gave me serious trouble and I withdrew due to having a low grade that wasn't going to transfer and would kill my GPA. What would be the difference if I transferred with my degree finished vs having one class left? I'm trying to figure out whether it would be better if I retook the class in CC during the summer or take it at Rutgers and transfer it over to my CC? If I retake it in the summer, I'll have to pay for a 5 credit course out of pocket, which would be very costly. Also the same professor will be teaching the summer class. EDIT: If it helps, a lot of the difficulty for me in Calc 2 for me came from how my professor made his tests. The entire class grade was made up of 5 tests. Each test has 8-10 questions, often made from the hard problems in each chapter. There was little room for error in his tests so one mistake killed your chance of getting an A. Also, he didn't curve and he allows you to retake one test which he makes 100X harder than the original.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Was gonna watch the walking dead tonight but noticed I don't have AMC.

So this week ends the first wave of my midterms/exams for my classes. So far, 2 grades have been posted and I've gotten a 70 and 78.5 on them (after curve). Considering these are my grades after a curve, I think I did very poorly. I studied hard, but I was just overwhelmed at how lectures flew by material so quickly.

This is my second year at Rutgers and my fourth year of college (transfer from community college). I'm going to have to do a 5th year because I kind of got screwed over by both Rutgers and CC. I'm considering changing my degree from a BFA (Mason Gross) to a BA (SAS) before next year because... 1. I may not be able to graduate in 5 years if I continue with the BFA because two classes that I need will conflict based on the schedules for the past few semesters. Unless they add more sections or give me special permission to leave class half an hour early, I'd have to stay in school longer 2. I feel like they expect us to eat, sleep, and breathe art. That's not really my thing. I've been taking all art classes, but I'd like to take a class in something else that interests me. If I switched to a BA I'd be able to take a few non-art classes. 3. I don't really want to take thesis  exhibition. I was talking to someone from my design class and we both agreed that it's more geared towards painting, sculpture, etc. majors. It's not required with a BA as far as I know. The thing is, I'm not sure if switching to BA would put me at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a job. Does the degree really matter?

Otherwise, I always attend lectures. What I might do though is attend one lecture/recitation a week if my situation permits. I've had Steinberg before for CS111.  From what I recall, his exams were straightforward (no surprises or silly lecture-based trivia), and he puts good slides up (though I heard he may have stopped doing that? Might be thinking of another class). Since he can be difficult to understand, I feel like I won't miss out on entirely too much. I've always been more of a self-study guy. My real concern would be if too much of the exam is based on stuff that you really should have been in class for, missing out on really comprehensive reviews where the professor ends up giving up half the test, etc. Also quick question: does recitation attendance matter/are there recitation quizzes? I'd probably end up attending the recitation I'm not registered for out of convenience for my schedule.

Today I went and spoke to the Dean of Students about not being able to take the second exam this Sunday because of having to travel back home, and mentally, obviously not being \"all in it\" after their death.  The Dean said that it shouldn\\'t be a problem and that he would sign off on it, however, when I asked who I talk to about a retake on another day, he said that Boikess does not give retakes, but that I would just be exempt from that exam. That sounds pleasant to the naked ear, however, now exams 1 and 3 are weighed twice as hard, and as someone who wasn\\'t too happy with their first exam score, was depending heavily on this one to get some points back.  Basically, I was wondering if anyone has experience with this sort of approach (i.e., no retake, just no exam), and how it could be beneficial, and should I just say screw it and take the shot on Sunday, to cover up the weight on just those two exams (besides the final)?

This semester I got a D in a class that I worked very hard for, but I'm guessing I was studying wrong, leading to my failure of 2 exams. When I got the exam I couldn't relate the concepts taught, to real life examples that were on the exam which caused me to fail miserably. I missed one class the whole semester and did every assignment but I just didn't have what it takes to get higher than a D. I know this is going to take a toll on my GPA, but have I ruined my chances to get into the business school? The class was fulfilling an SAS requirement and had nothing to do with the business school. I start taking Pre-Business classes next semester.

I stupidly dropped analytical physics 1 for the fall semester because of scheduling issues and assumed I would take the class in the spring. Now I find out I can't take the class because it's not offered in the spring. So I can't finish analytical physics 1 or 2 or statics ( req. Analytical physics 1) which are requirements for first year electrical/computer engineers. I do plan on taking analytical physics 1 and 2 over the summer to catch up, but I won't be able to finish the statics requirement until the fall of next year. Is this okay?  Also not sure on which classes to take for the spring semester. The classes I am taking are: multivariable calculus / MATLAB/ lab for chemistry / micro econ .... Should I just take another required elective just for now since all the classes required for me in sophomore/junior year have a physics pre req or another class ?

Currently I am at RBS-N majoring in finance and while it is a nice small campus, there is no college life. Right now I have a 3.4 so I don't qualify for RBS-NB and they only allow you to apply for one school. Has anyone broken into FO roles in finance while majoring in Econ?

It's only like my first real semester at NB as I transferred from Newark. I only started taking Gen Bio and Gen chem this semester and I'm starting to realize I don't really have any passion or motivation to learn all of this stuff. I recently really got into investing with stocks, I mean at first It just started as just a hobby for fun and stuff, but now I feel like I'm really into all of this stuff in terms of researching companies and all that.

My dorm tends to get noisy at night and I much prefer to do my work in the library all the same. However, after 2AM virtually everything on College Ave is closed down.

He had been sick for quite a while, missing a couple of weeks of class last semester. It seemed he had recovered from his illness, but he fell ill again a couple of weeks ago, and passed away early this morning. The School of Social Work sent out this e-mail early this afternoon:  Dear MSW Students:   Dean Cathryn Potter released this statement this morning regarding the death of Bert Goldberg, one of the School’s faculty members.   *“It is with great sadness that I write to tell you of Bert's death early this morning.*   *He will be remembered among his colleagues as a wise and kind leader, dedicated to his students and to supporting the highest quality of leadership and management in social work. A true social worker, exemplifying the best of our profession.”*   Our sympathies and thoughts go to Bert’s family, colleagues, students, and friends.  Antoinette Farmer  Associate Dean of Academic Affairs   and  Arlene M. Hunter  Associate Dean Student Affairs I had Bert for two courses (one of which is this semester), and he was an awesome teacher, and all around great person. I know it's kind of cliché to talk about how passionate someone who recently passed was and all that...but it's so applicable here. Bert was so passionate about social work, management of human service organizations, and passing his knowledge on to us, his students. He was old school, he didn't want us to use electronics in class, but somehow, he really made this admittedly-kind-of-dull topic really easy to relate to, and you could tell he knew what he was talking about. He was stern, but fair, and all around...a great educator. I'm really going to miss Professor Goldberg. Our class will go on, but it won't be the same without him.

CMF is the world’s largest student film festival and it’s our 8th year coming to Rutgers. There’s a long legacy between CMF and Rutgers, so our team is really stoked about being here. Little run-down of what Campus MovieFest is: Pretty much what we do is go to campuses around the country and lend students video equipment (HD cameras, MacBooks w/ Adobe editing software, sound equipment, tripods, etc.), to make a 5 minute or less video in one week. You’re not obligated to use our equipment to participate, but it’s there for you to use if you’d like. It’s totally free to participate, all the equipment is free of charge. The only catch is that we want you to make a video about anything you want. Any topic, any genre, any idea, if you wanna make it, we wanna see it. Then we have a grand red carpet finale in Livingston Hall and showcase the Top 16 videos, the Top 4 go on to compete nationally for $150,000 worth of prizes. (The team that brings the most audience members also wins a drone.) We hand out all the equipment on Tuesday (3/28) in the Livingston Coffee House. We’ll be there from 12-5PM, so stop by at anytime and we'll hook you up with everything you need.

I'm currently a college freshman who just started my second semester at a university in Oklahoma. I was born and raised in New Jersey, but my family moved to OK about five years ago. There are several reasons why I wish to leave this school: 1. Never liked the state, just feel out of place. 2. Poor linguistics department (currently a linguistics major). 3. Poor CS ranking (I want to go into computational linguistics). 4. Lackluster music and culture scene. 5. Not connecting with the student body at all. 6. Overall, I am very unhappy and still really miss home. So far, this idea of transferring to RU (NB) was just something I dreamed about in class. But now, I really feel like I should start looking into making this happen. Here's what I know:  - Last semester GPA: 3.41 (17 credit hours)  - Currently taking 17 credit hours  - Declared as Linguistics major (possibly trying out a CS double major...?)  - Paying full tuition, no scholarships or loans (besides federal direct loans and the Pell Grant) My parents have agreed to pay for my first year here, and the tuition is quite reasonable considering our in-state tuition. However, I'm afraid I'll absolutely have to take out some loans to study at RU. Are there any students here who shared my circumstances? Did you make the transfer happen? What sort of steps did you take? How's the debt? Any scholarships? Was it worth it?

He is typically spotted alone and in his usual business casual attire, which consists between a variation of different neutral colored sweaters and slacks.

There have been numerous incidents of him chit chatting with the Brower Common's workers -- It's safe to say that his regular dine-ins have caused him to bond with many of the staff members at B.C.

I was wondering if anyone would want to start something similar at Rutgers. Here\\'s the basic premise: There are 4-8 gym leaders around campus.

A challenger would look around that area for the gym leader and battle. If they win, they get a gym badge (it could be a sticker or something).  Depending on how many people are into it, there could even be an elite four and champion. The challenger that beats the champion, becomes the new champion- the next challenger must beat the new champion.

I've realized that this is more or less a useless degree on its own. Fortunately, I took a few CS classes in my career, and was able to complete some prereqs, including all of the math ones, as well as sciences to complete the BS requirement. I could finish up the major in a 5th year, but it would be really tough and I don't know if I could make it out with my GPA intact. Here is my tentative schedule: **Fall:** Comp Arc Systems Prog Information/DB Mgmt Discrete 2 Graph Theory  **Spring:** OS Numerical Analysis DB systems (not sure if it's offered in spring, if not I will probably take software meth) Programming Languages Discrete/Probabilistic Models in Biology Is this just too much? I should mention that this will be my 5th year and most of my friends will be gone, so I don't really give a shit about having a social life over the semester. The way I figure, I can suffer for 28 weeks for a good job and life when I graduate.

Similar questions I\\'ve seen got a lot of answers like \"just go to ur own state school\" but the only good one in CT is UConn, and Rutgers seems better for engineering. Any suggestions?

Here is what I was emailed today:\"I am writing in reference to your recent application for on-campus housing at Rutgers University. We have experienced increased demand for on-campus housing and unfortunately, we do not have enough space to accommodate everyone who has applied. Since your application was in the last group received, you are one of the students for whom we can only provide temporary housing until we obtain additional cancellations. Temporary housing will be located in a small house that accommodates 16 students where groups of 2 transfer students of the same gender will be assigned into a private room. The house is equipped with a bathroom, a living room and a kitchen. There will be access to cable TV and internet and a Residence Life staff member will be assigned to your group to help you with your needs. You will receive a rebate of ½ of the daily cost of a regular room for each day that you live in the lounge. That rebate will be in the form of a credit placed on your account when you are assigned to a regular space. As we receive cancellations, we will move students from the house to a regular space in a residence hall room or apartment, in the order of application date. You will not be allowed to stay in the house if a regular space is available to you. We expect, but cannot guarantee, that we will be able to offer you a regular space before the end of the fall term. If you live close enough to commute from home, you can choose instead to remain on a waiting list until a space becomes available to you. Please contact us if you would like to take this option. Of course, if you so choose, we will also cancel your contract and return your deposit if you no longer are interested in housing. Im 23 and got accepted into SEBS school over the summer.

After registering for all of my classes and getting my housing info done, quitting my job, and taking out loans for this semester, Rutgers ended up notifying me today that my transfer admission was rescinded. I only received an email about a “status change”. All of my courses have been dropped and I have no access to any portals.

I originally planned to major in computer science, but now I do not know if that is feasible. I was accepted into SAS and CoE Honors programs, but they gave me quite the conflicting financial aid. SAS gave me a sum of $9000 with $2500 in a one-time grant with the rest of it loans. CoE was far more generous as I received two scholarships totaling $7500 with the same grant and loans, totaling $17000. With my current financial situation, it would be a burden to major in computer science with the lack of aid (although my mom would be willing to take on the loans, which I really do not want her to do). 1)\\tWould I be able to transfer from computer engineering to computer science and (hopefully) do well enough to receive a scholarship of similar amount? 2)\\tCan I take the required CS courses in my first year of engineering so that if the above is possible I will be able to graduate in four years? 3)\\tOr is it possible to “transfer” my engineering scholarships to SAS so that I can get rid of this dilemma? 4)\\tIs it feasible to double major in both CE and CS? 5)\\tOr should I do what I do not want to do, and go into SAS the first year hoping that I earn enough in the future to pay back student loans?

Below I have summarized what this means exactly and how you should prepare for this transition.  Step 1: This means that you should go log onto webreg, deregister from ALL of your classes and stop attending class at Rutgers University.  Step 2: Next you should call the Penn State admissions office and tell them you are part of the Rutgers to Penn State transition group and that you would like to enroll at Penn State. They will likely seem confused and have no idea what you are talking about. This is OKAY. They are just joking.  Step 3: Remove all of your belongings from your Rutgers dorm/apartment and drive up to Penn State and find an empty room/classroom to put your stuff in. Again, Penn State students will likely have no idea what you are doing. Just like the admissions officers, they are just JOKING.  Step 4: Lastly, burn all your bridges/ties with rutgers staff and faculty because they are not part of the transition and will not be coming to Penn State with the rest of the students. Like everyone else, they will jokingly act confused. This is okay. You are better off without them.  Step 5: Now that you have enrolled at Penn State, you have successfully completed the transition. Welcome.  <eos> ', '<bos> Get out there and vote!!!!! EDIT: I encourage everyone to do their own research and decide who is the best candidate for them.

I've spent all my life in warm climates (Florida, South Carolina, Southern California, etc.) and I don't do particularly well in the cold.

I'm planning to go car free so I ideally I would like to be walking/biking distance from Bloustein but it seems like most apartments near downtown are very expensive (I'm looking for $800/mo max for a room). I hear most grad students live in Highland Park and it's a little less hectic and a lot cheaper but I'm concerned about the commute. The Raritan Avenue bridge and the Memorial Parkway interchange look very hostile to bicycles from Google Maps and in the winter I don't really want to be out biking or walking a whole lot.

I have a low GPA, a 2.4, and was wondering what are my chances of potentially being accepted to the Business school next year, my junior year? I'm interested in majoring in Accounting.  The thing is, I'm not great at math (I've heard accounting isn't heavily math focused, plus anyway I failed calc 1 first semester and barely - somehow - passed second semester with a C+) and looking at prereqs for eligibility of transferring is killing me. I'm terrified of the idea of taking precalc which is noted to have a 70% fail rate. Is it possible to take the 2 part precalc to satisfy the requirement? Would taking the 2 part put me at an disadvantage and be frowned upon come application time? Also, what is looked for in application? Do they care about extracurriculars because I hadn't been involved with anything last year and I feel like I can't do anything this year either mainly because I will be struggling a lot with math. I'm currently scheduled to take Intro to Macro, Intro to Micro, Intro to Financial Accounting, Precalc 115 and am also considering theater appreciation for the sake of a GPA booster. By the way, macro and micro will be taken back to back on a Monday in the same room and I was wondering if that would really screw me up. There aren't really any other open classes for the other requirements, so I guess I'd have to finish the other 2 spring semester and find some more GPA booster classes. I was wondering if it's wise for me to spend the entirety of this school on the business pre-reqs or not. Does it seem like I'm capable of doing so? Should I have a backup? I don't have any other interests and don't know what else to major in if I stay in SAS (my parents, for the record, are against the idea of me majoring in economics).

I may consider speaking to a counselor. I do have a brief history with Rutgers' counseling/psych services, though this time around, I don't suspect my mental health is a root cause of any specific problem. I've been planning to withdraw completely by next semester (already dropped a class earlier this semester), but at this point I have little incentive to stay. I already have a degree. But here's some things to note: I'm currently failing my classes, and it's past the 8th week withdrawal date. From what I could gather, if I withdraw completely at this point, I will receive something like an F, a U (unsatisfactory, which is the GPA-equivalent of an F), or perhaps something at the discretion of the professor for any given class. If that's the case, I'd rather fight to get a D for the sake of my GPA/transcript (though I'm not sure what looks worse, getting D's or withdrawing with good reason). These details are a bit fuzzy since some pages at Rutgers say slightly different things about how complete withdrawal works. If anyone has experience with withdrawing from Rutgers (well after the 8th week of the semester) and can chime in on the procedure, it would be appreciated. <eos> \", '<bos> Took the final earlier and felt it was oddly easy..

For the first exam, I watched a few YouTube videos, did some of the problem sets and looked at a previous exam that my friend had. Please help me! What else can I do to get better?

This is the third time I have launched DDoS attacks against Rutgers, and every single time, the Rutgers infrastructure crumpled like a tin can under the heel of my boot. This is a surefire sign that somebody needs to be fired... The pure incompetence of the IT department just amazes me. They took a step in the right direction by hiring a DDoS mitigation provider, Incapsula, to assist them with the attacks. However, they ended up destroying connectivity and routes in the process. I did not launch any attacks on Tuesday. Why should I have? The inexperience and poor skills of the IT department ensured that I didn\\'t need to. I sat here watching them foolishly attempt to fix the routing issues, withdrawing and appending routes (there were some instances when I laughed at what they tried to do). Anyway, good on you for finally realizing that you needed a DDoS mitigation provider! However, I\\'m guessing you went with a large company who offered you the lowest bid, because out of all the providers you chose, you picked Incapsula over Verisign and Prolexic... Incapsula is OK for protecting websites, not a university. Honestly, I am sitting here dumbfounded at the amount of incompetence displayed once again by the Rutgers IT department. I\\'m fairly certain I could run circles around all of you with my eyes closed, and one leg amputated... Just to show you the poor quality of Incapsula\\'s network, I have gone ahead and decimated the Rutgers network (and parts of Incapsula), in the hopes that you will pick another provider that knows what they are doing.

Ok, quick backstory. a few nights ago while on my way back to my house after club meetings on college ave I unfortunately misplaced my wallet. It was a nice leather coach wallet that I have had for years and strived to take good care of and it is very important to me. Anyways, I had given it up for lost when I get an e-mail from Rutgers saying that someone turned in my wallet. Ecstatic at my good fortune I rush to the CA student center only to find that while someone had indeed returned a wallet with my IDs in it, it was not my wallet, it was a shitty velcro piece of shit about to fall apart. Now, there was also around 50 dollars missing from the wallet, but that I was honestly expecting and woulda happily given anyway as reward. The wallet switch is a huge insult to me though considering how much personal value that wallet had to me, I'd honestly wish they'd not turned anything in at all because I am so extremely frustrated now after getting my hopes up of getting it back. So here is the deal R/rutgers. If you can find my wallet, I will give you $200 cash (double the value of the wallet), it is that simple. Im not expecting you all to snoop around, but if you hear someone in your hall or a friend or w/e talking about a new wallet or they pull out a wallet that looks like this  [url link] then you could easily be $200 richer in the near future! heres the deal though, I also want to know who this person is because A. I'd like to make them face me down in person and admit what they did. But much more importantly B. I want to be sure that whoever is responsible for this does not get a bigger reward because they chose to be a shitty person and take the wallet rather than return it right away. So if you return the wallet but can't rat the person out (or if you are that very coward) then you only get 50 bucks, still worth it for about an hours worth of work tops <eos> \", \"<bos> i've taken bio lab and chem lab before, but i'm assuming it'll be run a little differently? <eos> \", \"<bos> Hey everyone, I'm taking Introduction to Biochemistry and and Mol Bio this summer with Deis.

At the moment Rutgers is at the top of my list followed by Northeastern. I live in Massachusetts so I will not get the In state tuition at Rutgers. Here's what put Rutgers at the top of my list - Size. Due to growing up in a small town and going to a small high school I've always wanted to go to a large college, the bigger the better. Just something different - Football. I like watching football games and I can imagine going to Rutgers games with friends to cheer on your team is a blast.  - Proximity to NYC and Philly. I go to concerts fairly often and being within an hour of both these cities is probably my favorite thing about Rutgers. If a band I want to see goes on tour, they will definitely stop at NYC, and often stop at Philly. This is great because I could pick a date to see, or possibly go to both shows if they are good.   The only thing I'm weary about is the 5 separate campus thing. Do you usually stay in one of them for all your classes, or do most people have to commute between them throughout the day? If so, how easy is traveling between them? Do the buses arrive on time?  Lastly I would just like to hear from current and former students about the school in general. Convince me either to go here, or not to go here. What's great about the school? What sucks about it? Is it a good choice or should I be choosing some other place?  <eos> \", \"<bos> If you don't fail the final for calc 152, can you still fail the course?

I have received an acceptance letter from the Washington Center (TWC), for temporarily living and working at an internship in Washington, D.C over this following summer. While this is an extraordinary career opportunity - in that I will receive 9 academic credits (6 of which will go toward my Political Science major; it is one of the institutes that Rutgers and the Political Science Department officially collaborate with) and live and work at an internship in Washington, D.C., I am rather bashful of what to expect from this program and quite intimidated by the costs of said summer program (the total costs are approximately $10k, holy shit). So, for those who have applied to TWC and done all of this before: How was your living and internship experience in Washington, D.C. Is navigating your way through Washington, D.C. all by yourself something that can easily be overcome? How was your situation in regards to paying for the summer program? What were your sources of financial aid to fund for your participation in the program? And, finally, do you think it is all worth it in the end - for the academic, social, and professional experiences? Any insight into and advice for this would be highly appreciated. <eos> ', '<bos> Has anyone played Intramural volleyball at Rutgers?

I was drinking at a party off college ave, and wasn't in the best state, but also wasn't trashed. Being me, I wanted to get a fat sandwich, so my DD waiting in the car as I went in the store to get it. Ordered 1 fat sandwich. I think it's normally like 8 bucks, and the guy rang me up for like 15. Being drunk, I agreed and then realized what I agreed too. Decided it was too late and just took the L. As I'm waiting for my sandwich, some guy walks in smoking a cigarette and then shakes hands with the owner and they start speaking in Arabic. The guy was SMOKING IN THE STORE.

So to make a long story short, this is my first year attending Rutgers New Brunswick. I need all the advice and help I can get regarding student loans. Basically, my first two years of community college were paid in full by my grandmother (only less than 2,000 per year). When deciding on Rutgers, my family and I filled out the FAFSA and a few other suggested forms. The results we got were: -No grants (free money) -$6,500 per year loan (subsidized and the other part unsubsidized) Based on my fathers income (115k+ a year) we didn't qualify for any free money. However, my parents have extreme financial difficulties right now between our three kids, sick family members, cars, expensive property, etc. My parents do everything for be but they simply cannot afford to pay for my school right now. I didn't have much time to act, so based on a relatives advice I quickly applied for a 24k per year private loan from HESAA and got it, because Rutgers costs about 30k per year. The other day I was reading into my loan agreement and I'm very scared. Considering I lost a whole semester when transferring classes I will most likely need to attend RU for 3 years total. A 90k loan with 8-9% interest is supposedly going to cost me 217k over 20 years :( What should I do? How can I go about getting actual financial aid, since I truly am in need of it? What are my best options for student loans? The thought of over 217k in loans is enough to make me want to drop out.

My best friend asked me if I wanted to live with him, his girlfriend, as well as a mutual friend of ours in Rockoff for the 2014-2015 school year. I'm currently a junior and staying in the Livingston apartments- every single one of my classes from here on out will be on Livi because I'm in the Business School. If I move to Rockoff, I'll have to connect two busses or commute to get to the Business School every day which isn't terrible, but it's far less convenient than where I'm at now. I'm considering Rockoff because it's a guaranteed lease (whereas I'd have to rely on luck for Livi because of the lottery system). Rockoff is also almost exactly half the price of what I'm paying now, but is farther away from everything I need to get to. If there's anyone in here who has lived in Rockoff or just has an opinion on the matter, I appreciate any advice you can offer.

I found out today that I can take another rbs prereq (micro) at my local county college instead of commuting down to New Brunswick.

They were my age and non-threatening so I thought they were just asking for directions. When I stopped they told me they were taking a survey, so I said sure, I was in no rush. That\\'s when it got weird, they asked me if I had ever heard of the \"female version of God\", and then started talking about how if there is a father and son, there must be a mother. They asked me some other stuff too like if I lived on campus, if I believed in God, if I was busy that night, etc. It was a five minute conversation but near the end of it they started talking about how once the mother of God comes it\\'ll \"fulfill the prophecy\" They wanted me to stop by for a half hour meeting at some house (I think they said it was on High street or something). I told them I couldn\\'t but they kept pressing and asking if I could do it later in the week. I just kept saying I was busy and such. Then one of the guys says something about how important it is since \"the end is coming\". At this point I\\'m sufficiently weird-ed out so I started to walk away from the two and the one guy asks me for my contact information so they can text me about future meetings. I just told him I\\'d prefer not to and continued on my way to the Grease Trucks.

Loved almost everything else about it).  Cons: potential cons seem to be noise, but I can make my way around that. I'm a deep sleeper anyway so I likely wont get bothered much either.

I moved into my dorm on saturday because I'm a transfer student, and my building is all upperclassmen so no one else moved in until Sunday.

I want to be a civil engineer (Haven't actually declared it yet but this is one of the surest decisions I've ever had) and I'm interested in the 5-year master's program, but you know, life's kind of hard. I have a 3.5 GPA right now but I have some serious doubt I can keep that up for the next three years including this semester. What I am also curious in is minoring. I have credit for US History, Computer Science(The java class), and did General Psychology for a 100 level elective for H/SS. As of right now I'm not sure what to do for my other two higher level H/SS electives. I love history and psychology because they're easy and interesting to me so I'd love to take more I just don't know If I should specialize. So with minoring, I'm sort of unsure if I should try to get a minor because of all the added coursework that I have to take and I'm sort of just confused. If I can get an easy minor due to civil engineering in environmental science that would be nice.

It had to be renegotiated because it was approved by UMDNJ, not Rutgers. Here is an update of our struggles: \"We met with management for the sixth time on Thursday, December 4th. In response to management’s continued pushing for their “Pre-Negotiations MOA”, we submitted a comprehensive proposal to align systems in a way that would be more acceptable to us. It provides tuition remission for employees and dependents, clarifies that there will be 17 holidays and personal days, reduces parking costs, ensures incumbent employees would not be required to pay back projection pay and allows us to challenge disciplines for time and attendance. Management rejected our position. There is a double standard when management claims to want to align the \"legacy\" systems yet continues to refuse to align other benefits like tuition and parking. Rutgers\\' refusal is even more infuriating in light of their recent tentative agreement with CIR, another UMDNJ Legacy union, that does provide tuition remission and reduced parking costs for interns and residents. They\\'ve added insult to injury by agreeing to provide those benefits to one UMDNJ Legacy union and deny it to others. Equally insulting is management\\'s latest wage offer - only one tenth of a percent more per year than their previous offer for a total now of 1.2% a year.  Don\\'t be surprised when management announces wage increases for the non-union employees shortly.  According to our sister unions from Rutgers, management has used this tactic in years past to lower expectations and divide the membership to pressure the negotiating committee into settling. Remember, there is a lot more at stake during these negotiations: issues like achieving respect and parity on par with Rutgers Legacy employees and protecting our job security.

We are all looking forward to this joyous and historic event, in which the President of the United States will be speaking at a Rutgers commencement for the first time in our 250-year history. We know it will be a great day for all our graduates.  Because of the unprecedented number of requests for seating we have received over the course of this registration period, we will be utilizing a ticketing system, which is a change from past years. We will be providing each graduating student with one ticket for the graduate plus three guest tickets and one parking pass. The tickets will be barcoded and will not be transferrable. Ticket holders will be required to have photo identification, and all guests must have a ticket regardless of age. While the limit to three guests at the stadium is a change from past practice, it ensures that every graduating student from Rutgers University–New Brunswick and from Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences is accommodated. You have already registered for your parking pass, and will be notified when the ticket registration system is open.  Please be aware that Rutgers will be providing viewing sites at other venues—the College Avenue, Livingston, and Busch Student Centers, for example—for additional guests.  If you have not already made arrangements for your regalia, please do so immediately. All graduates must wear regalia to be on the field during Commencement.  We will be in touch with you during the week of May 9 with further logistical details about the event, including time of arrival and parking. In the meantime, you have our congratulations on your upcoming graduation and our best wishes as you complete your courses.

I'm pretty sure I'll be picking Newark, but I'm just still waiting to hear back from UMD. Western Illinois mailed me my evaluation of credits without me even asking, but I haven't gotten anything from Rutgers (or any other college for that matter). I looked up advisers at Newark, but I only found ones for enrolled students. So I picked the one according to my last name and emailed her letting her know my situation and asked about transfer credit evaluations and how to go about getting one. She read it and didn't respond (I had read report request on my work email)... Even though I also said let me know if I was supposed to go about this a different way. So now I'm REALLY not sure what the best way to go about this is. I'm transferring from a community college so knowing what/how many credits will be taken is kind of important in my choice too. Any transfers out of state (or in state) know how to get their credits evaluated? I'm from Illinois, can't really just pop in for an appointment until I do visits haha.

I encourage everyone to subscribe to other college/university subs so that you can see the type of questions they have and issues they're dealing with. More importantly, if you pick nearby schools or better ranked schools you will be able to gauge their communication skills, areas of focus and academic/career aspirations. This will help you identify any favorable or important ideas or actions to integrate into your college life and academics. Remember, in 5 years or less these will be the people you will be working with or competing with in a work environment so it's important to keep an edge and be your best. As a side effect, you will make Rutgers proud! <eos> \", '<bos> Where ya at? <eos> ', '<bos> and if so...anyone need a partner? <eos> ', '<bos> I applied to Rutgers NB my senior year (last year) and only got into the Camden school.

I've read a ton about the major and the course offerings off of the program's and the American Studies Association's websites, but I'm looking for student input.  Few questions: Is it more of a cultural studies major, or is it interdisciplinary like it's advertised? Have you felt like you've learned or developed anything tangible (i.e. analytical thinking, writing skills, etc.) from this major? EDIT: Also, how are student class sizes?

Watching movies, going out to eat, sleeping a lot, etc... I figure I won't really learn much in the next day or two anyway, and I'd rather not stress myself out more by cramming. Does anyone actually use this method? Does it work for you? Am I making a terrible decision?  I'll update you guys after I get my grades back, to let you know if I was successful or not.  UPDATE (5/12): I passed all my classes (3 upper-level CS courses) with a 3.0 average! I didn’t study at all for finals, and kind of half-assed my final projects. I didn’t mention this in my initial post, but I worked pretty hard all semester (started slipping about 3-4 weeks out from finals). So, I didn’t do very well at the end but the preparation I had allowed me to still do okay overall. In conclusion, I’m satisfied with my performance and glad I passed, but it’s bitter-sweet. I know I could have done better if I studied and put more effort into my projects. Not studying at all for finals– I’ll give it a 3/10, wouldn’t recommend.  <eos> \", '<bos> I applied for housing, but did not choose a room, can I still opt of housing? <eos> ', '<bos> Basically, I’m a transfer student and I’m taking a Lit class to fulfill a gen ed requirement.

I have a reslife shirt and I was thinking about having some fun by putting it on and going up there to scare them by making them think reslife was at their door at 3am all pissed off.

I plan to visit the CS department and career development center soon, to get more info from them. My main issue with NJIT is the professors. Most of them are foreigners, and some of them can barely speak English. I sometimes have to dumb down my grammar (basically, speak like an idiot) just to communicate with them. I feel like I\\'m paying $14k per year to be taught by the cheapest people that the school could hire. How does this compare to the professors at RutNewark? What is their stance on taking summer courses at Bergen Community College? NJIT allows it, but some of the \"equivalent credits\" requirements are in their favor. For example, it would take me 2 CS courses at Bergen to equal 1 CS course at NJIT.

I'm currently a NJ High School Senior trying to figure out life. I got accepted into both SAS and SOE. I'm a little lost as to what I want to do specifically in the future. I know that it's going to be something related to computers. As to whether it's hardware or software, I don't know yet. Because of this, I'm also debating whether I should enroll in SOE or SAS (ECE vs CS) SOE has ECE which is basically a mix between EE and CS.

A friend advised me to choose SOE (ECE) because it was more versatile. Initially, I agreed with him. However, after doing some research, I found a lot of CE students complaining that the ECE classes pertaining to software were horrible and that they would recommend people to take CS substitutes. I don't know anything about about the classes pertaining to hardware. So for a student who does not know whether to learn about software or hardware, what should I choose? Are the things I read online about ECE true or are they outdated/false? I know all this is a bit general since I don't know how much I should write out but if you guys have any questions on the specifics, feel free to ask. <eos> \", \"<bos> I posted a few months about wanting to start a podcast but was very busy with work unfortunately.

As much as summertime in New Brunswick is pretty great (less people, more parking spaces, lazy days chilling on your porch) in my experience of three summers here there is also a rise in crime. Since there are less people around, it is easier to get away with stealing/mugging. Keep doors, **windows**, and cars locked, and always try to walk with a friend if you are walking anywhere at night.

So, I have a couple questions that would be nice to have answered by people with actual experience at Rutgers since it's my #1 choice right now for a school. 1. Is it better to go to a two year school first and transfer? I've taken classes from community colleges through their high school program and people tend to keep to themselves (I'm introverted anyway) so that kind of sucks, but at the same time the tuition is going to be a LOT less, I know. 2. SAS SAT/GPA scores are a lot higher on the [.pdf]([url link] file on the admissions site than I thought they would be. Yet people seem to claim here that they've easily gotten in with scores in the low 1700s with an average GPA.

If you don't already know, there's very little chance anyone can tell you with 100% confidence what your classes curve will be. This is because they vary from teacher to teacher, year to year, department to department, and most are based on overall performance. However, if it's reassurance you're looking for, come right in! I'm sure we're more than willing to share stories of what the curve was last semester / year if that helps at all. Or even how our finals went / our final grade to help determine if there was a curve to begin with.

He loves music, plays a huge array of instruments, and works extremely hard.

Due to some extenuating circumstances, my gpa declined causing me to not fulfill my conditions of enrollment. I really want to attend RU-NB and was told to do another full-time semester my cc. One admissions counselor told me that doing very well in 12 credits worth of classes for one semester will remedy the situation and likely result in admission. Another one told me that it should be 18 credits in one semester. I'm confused. I usually hear of people taking 16 credits in one semester at most. I am only registered for 14 credits this semester, as that is truly all I can afford; I am reliant on fin aid. Will this lack of 4 credits hurt my application for the fall 2018 semester?
