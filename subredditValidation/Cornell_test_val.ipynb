I'm not a microbiology major but I'm in a microbio lab at the moment so some of it does make sense already. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I was a guaranteed transfer so I saved some money and went to community college (but took 18 credits to compensate). Super excited for cornell and would love to hear anyone's advice or thoughts on anything! Any advice/thoughts on:  -being a transfer at cornell -being in ILR at cornell -cornell in general -student life (clubs, parties etc) -housing (i'm going to try to request west campus...hows this for someone whos never lived at college? lame, i know)  -the weather (I'm from south PA)  Anything is appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi everyone, inc freshman here. I will be on campus over the summer (6/24 to 8/2), and I am planning to bring some stuff I will also use during the upcoming school year. Is there a nearby place where I can store a suitcase's worth of stuff (and for a reasonable price)? Also if anyone else is around I'd love to hang out. Danke <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm just a prefrosh here and have so far mostly gotten emails on my @cornell.edu address about orientation which is helpful and expected. But over the last couple days I've gotten some emails from different vendors around Ithaca and an obvious spam message asking for people to do \"administrative work\" from home. This isn't really a big deal, but is it something that persists and that most students deal with? Are student names and emails published? Also, I've gotten emails from two different Orientation Leaders saying they're my OL... I assume thats a mistake; should I just send an email to them asking for clarification?  <eos> \n",

A lot of people tell me to go for Bio since they think Organic Chem will be hell. So I got some questions: 1) Anyone whos a Bio or Chem major rn, or even transferred between the two, how was your experience? How was the professors? 2) Will there be a tremendous difference of classes between the two majors? Since I'll be filling up requirements for med school either way, would I be taking similar classes? (except for the lang requirements in cas) Thanks a lot for everything!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Class was full during pre enroll in April, didn't manage to get on the waitlist. There are now two open spots in the class after senior add/drop today and I'm wondering if those spots automatically go to the first two people on the waitlist who have the earliest add/drop times (at this point, juniors) once the enrollment window opens up. Since I'm not on the waitlist, am I able to grab one of the spots tomorrow morning or will they automatically be filled by currently waitlisted students? If so, is my best bet to try and get at the end of the waitlist once waitlist spots open? <eos> \n",

I'm gonna be a rising junior, and didn't really regret my decision to not join a fraternity, however I notice my friends and I don't go to parties as much as our freshman year friends who decided to join greek life.  Its not like we are total shut ins, we go out maybe once or twice every two weeks, but some of our friends go out nearly every day. We are in one the easier regarded majors as well. Is this common? <eos> \n",

I'm wondering if there are any groups on campus that would get together to play some rock/alternative music (I happen to like those the most). I think that would be very fun, and would help me learn faster.  Also, I'm trying to get a guitar. I've asked some people, and many say that I should be expecting to spend between $2-300. Also, where should I purchase one? Craigslist probably won't work too well.  I know that McNeil and Guitar-works downtown has some decent stuff, but I don't know a thing about guitars, and don't want them to pressure me in one direction.  Maybe someone could recommend some models here: [url link] Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I finished a3 alone/without any external help but what if moss (the program they use to detect plagiarism) finds something that happens to be really similar to what someone else was doing by coincidence? there are 600 in the class so there are bound to be similarities. I prob don't have anything to worry about if I haven't done anything since they've been using moss without problems for a long time but it still worries me <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I recently got admitted to CoE - I'm heading into either CS or ECE im not sure which, but theres a bunch of things I want to know. 1)How difficult are the types of classes I'm expected to take - how many do you suggest taking per semester and what is the best way to manage time? 2)Some things to definitely start doing or habits to start before coming? 3) How are the parties? Is it hard to get into them as freshmen? Do people typically smoke weed at the parties/ how are the campus police if any? 4) How are the dorms? Which are the best? If you can tell me some pro cons of the building itself and whats near it? 5) Clothing for a guy ... what types of clothes should I get, and any specific brands? How much should I anticipate bringing? Where would the best place to shop be? 6)When can you start joining groups and clubs? 7)Any tips you guys have that you wish you knew coming? 8) As a guy what things are very important and needed for dorm life 9) Anything else you guys would like to educate me about that I can use.  Will probably have more questions but thank you! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Thank you in advance for reading this.  I know a lot of factors go into admissions but I am curious if I even have a shot. I never considered applying to an Ivy league school until a friend mentioned it. I would be a Junior transfer student planning to major in Econ. I had a 1350 SAT score for Math/CR in high school. I did alright for most of high school until senior year. Due to my issues with senior year I decided to go to a cc first. I am currently a Business major with a 3.3 gpa which should go up this semester. I have been an active student life, volunteering and will be graduating a semester early with an associates. Frankly I am hesitant when it comes to applying to any four year schools because of my senior year of high school. I am afraid that because I only went to a cc for 1 and a half years they will take into account that year heavily. Also since I will not be attending any school during what should have been my 2nd spring semester, is there anything I should do to bulk up my application? I live in a smaller town so it would be tough to find a job/internship pertaining to my major (though I will still try). Would any humanitarian work be better? <eos> \n",

Also, if anyone has a CHEM 2090/2070 syllabus that they could share with me so I know what to study from the textbook, that would be much appreciated.

            "<bos> Why do drivers in Ithaca always seem so angry? Most of them don't seem like bad drivers, although they can be kinda of aggressive. I frequently see other drivers yelling at people through car windows or screaming and pointing, or pedestrians stopping in the middle of the street because they don't like the way someone is driving (saw it happen to someone else and had it happen to me as well). I've driven through Boston and Connecticut a fair amount and there was less road rage there. Is it just a dislike of Cornell students being in Ithaca? Alternatively, I guess I could just be a bad driver but I've seen plenty of other drivers getting irrationally upset at other people. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am talking about the supplement course not the main Chem course. I’ve heard that it really helps with 2070, but the Professor is very very intimidating. Do we grade our own practice exams or does he? Do they count toward your grade in the class?Also, is it advisable to only take 1070 or 1007 as well? I haven’t taken Chem I’m a long time and barely remember anything so I’ll probably need all the help I can get.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Alright I'm a bit of a late admit to the math major and I'm not far along in the curriculum at all (and my adviser is understandably not really able to help in regards to that) so any help is appreciated. I've also kind of asked this before and the answers were good but it was less specific and since add/drop is coming around I'm going for it again.  I'm honestly not the best math student it's just a cool subject to me and I like a challenge so why not.  Anyway I'll be a junior and only just finished multi (yeah I know) so my question is: should I just steer clear of any type of honors courses and take math courses that would be less difficult and hopefully help build more skill?  I'm thinking I'd like to focus more on the Algebra track than analysis so maybe it would make sense to do the following this semester: 3110 (non-honors analysis for the track) 3320 (number theory) 3040 (prove it)  And use spring to take care of the rest of analysis track plus an algebra course. The 3040 course would be to get a better understanding on proofs, number theory the professor said could help with the same (plus it's interesting) and I was told 3110 is good and not too heavy. Then use senior year to take honors linear algebra track mixed with other courses? Or would it be too late to take honors lin alg my senior year?  The OTHER probably not so smart option would be the following:  Take an honors track this year (either alg. or analysis) with one other math course each semester (since I'm sure that's all I'd be able to handle). If I did that should I use Prove It as my second math course to reinforce my use of proofs? (Also I'm sure it's probably a really bad idea to take an honors course without a good understanding of proofs I'm just kinda running out of time so it's stressing me out and I don't wanna avoid them altogether).  So anyway...yeah it's all a bit of a mess. Any help at all is really appreciated sorry for rambling! <eos> \n",

Now that I'm finally done stressing about what school I go to, I'm starting to think more about my major.  I said that I wanted to do chemE on my application, but I'm not sure anymore. I don't know if I actually enjoy chemistry, or if I just like it because it comes easily to me. What I do know is that I want to do both engineering and business. Either a double major in business and engineering, or a minor in business/finance. I've also been thinking about Operations Research. OR seems to be a major that really integrates aspects of business and engineering, and I've also read that it pays well. However, I'm having a hard time really getting a grasp of what OR really is, or what I job in OR is like. Do people ever do a OR major with a minor in business?  Basically, I know I'll be combining engineering in business somehow, but I'm not sure of the best way to do it I'll either do ChemE or OR as my major. And I since I could really see myself in business, a minor/double major in business to go with it. I'm hoping I can get some insights on how to sort this out from people who know about these things. Thanks in advance for any help! <eos> \n",

I'm currently taking PHYS 1112 and MATH 1910, and I want to continue with physics next semester rather than randomly take chem in between 2 physics classes. I will eventually need CHEM 2090 but I'd like to put that off to next year, especially since the chem lab times conflict with CS 2800 and the ENGRI I want. However, it says 1920 is a prereq for 2213. Is there any chance I can take them at the same time? Does anyone have experience taking them at the same time? Any other suggestions? <eos> \n",

Some other people say it's actually inflated, compared to places like MIT.  In your experience, how difficult are Cornell classes, and how hard is it to maintain a good GPA (3.7+)?

            "<bos> Hi guys, I'm a freshman planning on majoring in CS in the college of engineering. Do you think it would be a good idea to take CS 2800 concurrently with CS 1100? Or is it too much for a freshman? Apart from that I plan on taking MATH 1910, a FWS, and a PE. I have credit for Chem so I am skipping it, but I don't have any for Physics, which I would do instead but apparently 1910 is a prereq, so I'll take it next semester. If CS2800 is too intense, I was thinking of taking some Econ or maybe an intro to Stats of some sort? Thanks for any advice. <eos> \n",

Cornell denied her admittance to ILR. I know Cornell is all about \"fit\" and I assure you she fit. No money, no minority or first gen. status hurt her so we do not want to start all over again for the same outcome. ILR is her jam - no other majors comes close. Thank you for your time. <eos> \n",

In what profession is it acceptable to leave at 3 fucking 30 unless you get to work at 6 fucking 30? In my opinion we need to start lowering the cost of higher education by firing 60-70% of these ass jockey bureaucrats and forcing the rest to work REAL hours. Fucking A <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi guys! So I'm a senior in high school and I have completed my Cornell CAS application, but I have some questions: 1. How is the neurobiology program at Cornell? I did research in neurobiology this summer and I'd love to continue and possibly major in Neuroscience/Neurobiology (can't remember what the exact title I selected was) so any insight would be appreciated! 2. How bad is the snow really? I'm from Maine, would I be able to handle it? Does it get really depressing during the winter? 3. I'm a girl and I'm on the fence about rushing a sorority. Does anyone know how prevalent sorority life is for girls, or have any other insights on that aspect of the social life? 4. How is study abroad? 5. Does anyone else find the cornell.edu webpages unnecessarily cumbersome to navigate? 6. This one is kind of frivolous and you can feel free not to answer, but my entire family went to Dartmouth and I was wondering if anyone could give some insider info on Dartmouth vs. Cornell?

Already, I can already tell that Hasbrouck will not be a good fit for me (I was not able to view the area as I moved from california), so I was wondering if anyone here has had experience with terminating a lease early.

            "<bos> I'll be a freshman at the College of Arts and Sciences this fall. So turns out I did pretty bad on some subjects on my IB exam, which makes me unable to receive credits for some intro courses. I plan to take the placement exams to try to get the credits, but in this case, I suppose I have to sign up for the introductory courses during course enrollment?  This means I'll have to use my credits (if I earn them) during the add/drop period, which starts one day after the placement exams. How long does it take for the results to come out and will I be able to earn the credits instantly? I'm worried that the courses will be full.

            "<bos> So from what I've heard, CS 3110 is notoriously difficult and time consuming.  If I were to learn OCaml on my own before taking the course, would that make it significantly easier? Would it still be super time-consuming? Is it kind of expected that you know some OCaml before taking the course? Would it make the start of the course easier, but then still be hard later on? (Which I would assume to be the case...) Additionally, how difficult is CS 4820 (introduction to analysis of algorithms) compared to CS 3110? Is there any good way of preparing for it before taking it?  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

My parents weren't pleased and ended up giving me an ultimatum in which I have to get a 3.7 or higher next semester or they are forcing me to transfer to a local state school. Honestly, that goal is pretty realistic so I'm not gonna complain. I admit that I've fucked around a lot first semester. However, I just want opinions on the matter. I wouldn't be surprised if they were just using that to motivate me to do better next semester, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they were actually serious... <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Long story short, I came to Cornell last Spring at the start of the Spring semester of this year (so technically I am still a second-semester freshman).  I sort of just stayed holed up in my room studying a lot last year, and didn't make any friends - lots of acquaintances - but no friends. I live in a single on West right now and I am so isolated that I'm feeling extremely depressed after spending the last two weeks here. I haven't been to a single party, and I haven't had a real conversation since I got here. I don't know anyone in my classes, and people don't generally seem open to meeting new people in them. I'm thinking of joining some random clubs when they start back up, but besides that, how can I meet new people? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Please don't take this post the wrong way -- as in, I'm ungrateful that I was able to land a job or anything like that. I understand how difficult it is these days to get one and I am aware how fortunate I am. I didn't have a great time in college. I wanted to go to my state school, but my parents expected more and so I went to Cornell. Majored in Computer Science and just graduated, and yet I feel like I can only code at the 1110-2110 level. I mostly BS'ed my way through classes and abused office hours for answers. My projects in the higher level classes were basically the TAs' projects. My parents expected me to get a job, so I got a job. It's actually quite good as far as jobs go. 6 figures, nice people, and room to grow. I always wanted to start my own business but I never really knew what I wanted to start. Now I find myself starting work in a city far from home that I have no interest living in working a job in a subject I wasn't particularly good at or had much interest in.  I sincerely believe I'll be the dumbest person at this company by far. No, this really isn't imposter syndrome. I literally couldn't do basic arithmetic during one of my interviews. I thought I horribly failed them, and somehow got the job. I looked up some of my coworkers, and their accomplishments are so far beyond what I've done it's just funny at this point. I could barely handle the CS curriculum and no extracurriculars and these people were high school valedictorians, won major national competitions, etc. What do I do?  ***EDIT***: I'd like to thank everyone for your responses. They definitely made me feel much better and less \"trapped\". I will try to post an update thread a few months down the road. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello Everyone! I am in my junior year at a smaller state school in Illinois and am starting to look at graduate programs to continue with education instead of jumping into industry. I haven't decided on which path I would like to take yet, but I'd like to know if you think I even have a chance at getting into Cornell's CS program. Some info about me:  * I am a junior in CS at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, IL * I have held 2 research positions, one in aerospace, one in OS security * I have maintained a 4.0, but expect a dip next semester to 3.9ish (grad courses) * I will have taken 2-3 graduate level courses before I graduate with my BS Looking at just admission requirements, I feel like I have a chance, but I'm concerned that coming from a no-name school will hurt me in the application process. Any advice? Also, I noticed there were a few options as far as Masters are concerned. Is there a huge difference between M.S, M.Eng., and the Ithaca and NYC Tech campuses?  Thanks! <eos> \n",

Then I look at Cornell and it seems way too intimidating to even request information to apply. I did, but I am feeling very uneasy about even applying, as if I don't deserve to go to Cornell.  I was hoping someone could offer some encouragement or advice to me.  <eos> \n",

So obviously I call them and don't mention fall break and that I'd be in Ithaca, but do I just get them to reschedule for winter break? <eos> \n",

She recommended for me to take a minor, so my question is what would be a good suggested minor for someone in info sci to take? I want to do CS but a bit daunted by the fact that 2800, 3410, 3110 seem like nightmares to have to take graded. A lot of people I know are taking a Dyson business minor but haven’t heard that playing a role in any job searches. Any help or experience with this is appreciated. <eos> \n",

I couldn't have made it in from high school, so I never applied as my grades were pretty average(3.5-4.0) until my senior year. I am pretty unhappy where I am at now, and someone suggested transferring to Cornell. If anyone has any information for me that would be great. No need to hold back on any bad news, just figured I might as well ask.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I'm a CS major in the College of Engineering. I have a lot of academic interests/passions and I'm trying to prioritize them before the next pre-enroll period. I went through the list of minors that Cornell has to offer and was left with three that interested me most: Info Sci, Linguistics, and the Dyson Business Minor for Engineers. This might sound crazy, but I want to minor in all three. I'm willing to put in the work, and with careful planning I think that it actually won't be as much work as it sounds.  Am I allowed to use my major-required elective courses to \"double-count\" for minors?  For example, I want to take CS 4740 and CS 4744 as part of my CS electives. These courses are cross-listed as LING 4474 and LING 4424 respectively, and are acceptable classes to count towards the linguistics minor. LING 4424 is even allowed for the Info Sci minor--is it ok to use one course to fulfill a major requirement and two minor requirements all at once? Another question I have is: are minors even \"useful\"? I'm using them primarily as a way to organize my interests into groups of courses that are deemed related enough by Cornell to be called a minor. But what will employers think if they look at my future resume and see CS Major and triple minor? I want it to reflect my academic passions but am worried it will make it look as if I gamed the system (which I guess I kind of am). Also just for fun, what are your majors / minors? What drives your passions? Personally, I love CS because I view it as a nice mix between science and art. It's a great way of approaching problem solving and what I believe to be the future of humanity. <eos> \n",

I've reached out to Sweet Sensations and plan to also reach out to the recreational services with the intent on applying to the fitness center network. Has anyone worked at either one of these places? If so, what was your experience like? What was the starting pay (the recreational services posted $10 per hour, is this accurate?)? How flexible did you find the hours to be? If you have not worked at either of these facilities, but worked in another one, feel free to mention it! Really, I just want to know how the work environment is. Federal Work Study is not applicable to me so those jobs would be out. <eos> \n",

Its my understanding that taking 4110 really helps getting on the 3110 course staff, but since I'm a rising junior, and I'll (hopefully) be doing coding interviews this fall, I was wondering how much 4820 actually helps with answering coding questions, or if going through hackerrank and Cracking the Coding interview is sufficient.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> One of my classes requires a final project, and my group for it has 4 people. Around a month ago (and every week after), we all would set aside project goals and agree on who was doing who. When these goals were rather easy (write up an idea for the project, write up what you'll do), all 4 of us contributed. Now though, in the last two weeks of the project, three of us have been meeting our goals while the fourth hasn't taken the time to update us on his progress. As it's really too late to turn back now, we see this partner will have had little contribution to the project overall. Does this look bad to graders, and would it be better to just attribute some work to him or to be honest and just lay out the facts? If this were something little, I wouldn't mind just attributing the work to him. But this work was pretty significant to the project, and I ended up having to do it all in addition to what I was assigned to do.  And just to note, we haven't left this partner out in the dark. We've constantly had him present in the group meetings and have asked him how progress is going via text. He never responds. Thanks :) <eos> \n",

I was planning to share a dorm with two other friends, and we're all girls and were wondering what the best dorms for triples are, or if there were good suites for three people available? We were currently looking at Balch Hall as a top option, but one of us wanted to be at a coed dorm. Are there any pros and cons to an all girls dorms vs coed?  <eos> \n",

I visited Cornell last weekend and am in love with it, so I will likely apply ED, but I am still unsure of what I most want to major in. In your experience how difficult is it to do an internal transfer from one college to another, say Econ(CAS) to PAM(Human Ec) or vice versa? I love Cornell but I don't want to go there and then realize I made the wrong major choice and not be able to switch. Any insight would be great!! <eos> \n",

I’m a sophomore, and long story short, I’ve just discovered that I want my education to focus more on the applied side of physics than the theoretical side. I also want to do engineering when I graduate.  I’ve searched the Internet for information as to what determines if you get accepted as an internal transfer or not, and I can’t find any information about acceptance rates or GPA cut offs. Is there any? What is it? And would it be my overall GPA? How does the admissions committee decide if I get accepted? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm going to be commencing my studies in CS at the College of Engineering next year, and I was wondering, how do you go about picking freshman classes? I know it's not for a while yet, but do they assign you an adviser or someone that you can talk to beforehand, or are you kind of on your own? Just based on looking at some information online, I kind of picked out a sample schedule for myself, assuming I would take 5 classes a semester (not even sure if that number is right). I'd appreciate any advice (if one class is too hard, etc, etc). Thanks! 1. Multivariable Calculus for Engineers (assuming I pass the Calc BC test). I think I have a pretty good grasp on calc, but should I still retake regular calculus first? How different is calculus at Cornell from what one might experience in a high school AP class? 2. Engineering General Chemistry 3. Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures (CS 2110, I have credit for AP CS and am comfortable with programming). 4. One of those introduction to engineering courses (any suggestions?) 5. A freshman writing seminar-thing (again, any suggestions? Thanks in advance!  <eos> \n",

My fiancé and myself are looking to open up a business and we are wondering if Ithaca would be a good town to open up shop! The questions are Do you go to a coffee shop off campus? If there was a new coffee shop in town would you try it out? Do you play any trading card games, board games or video games on a regular basis? If there was a coffee shop that also routinely held various game nights and competitions would you frequent the establishment? Thanks for your time - I really appreciate any answers I get! EDIT: Thank you to everyone for the thoughtful responses! This is exactly what I was looking for! We are still quite a ways away from being able to open our shop, but we aren't going to let our dream die! We aren't 100% certain WHERE we are going to open shop yet, but I know that it WILL happen, someday (hopefully soon!) <eos> \n",

I visited Cornell a few years ago for a conference (what a pretty campus you have!) and bought a hoodie as a memento. I was wearing said hoodie recently around my campus back home. A guy in his 20s stopped me and introduced himself as a Cornell student visiting my school, and asked if I also attend to Cornell. When I told him that I did not, he seemed very confused and asked me pretty aggressively why I was wearing the crest of a school I haven't attended. I told him that I visited for a school event and he continued to press me about why I would wear another school's colors... I was pretty taken aback and walked away.  I was just wondering if there are unofficial rules-of-thumb about people wearing Cornell gear without attending, or if I just ran into someone in a bad mood. Thanks! <eos> \n",

If anyone from the Cornell Symphony Orchestra, Cornell Chamber Orchestra, or just anyone proficient on a string instrument wants to take me up on this, please let me know as soon as possible. I will pay money if necessary. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just to Preface I'm a HS Senior that has had to deal with a lot of just terrible things in the last few years. My father is very abusive and on top of it has placed an insane amount of pressure on me. I'm a fairly strong applicant and after looking at the programs available at Cornell I really want to go. However, I've heard that the students at the school are overly cutthroat, pressured, and depressed. I want to go into either CS or Econ so I would apply to CAS. Can anyone tell me how accurate these claims are because I don't want to just leave one environment that was really bad for me and enter a similar one, any advice is appreciated! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Genuinely curious - what's the moderation team's stance on these? Because I feel like, despite them being relatively nonintrusive otherwise, it's still unpleasant to have droves of maddened high school juniors/seniors asking the same question. If anything, maybe a sticky/megathread would help reduce/eliminate them. Just my two cents, though. <eos> \n",

I was an academic coach last year, and will be my senior year. running start: I currently take all but one of my classes at a local community college as a college level alternative to high school, which is funded by Washington state. I take a full courseload at the community college, and take Japanese 3 at my high school. I have 42 college credits since i finished spring quarter. I plan to take Japanese AP in highschool next year. My community college average GPA from this year is 3.95, but my Japanese grade is around a 3.6, which brings my total grade down a bit. Instead of the standard senior social studies and English classes offered at highschool, i took English 102 and Macroeconomics. What are my chances? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm sorry to say this, but Dragon Day has been rather lame for the last few years. Next year, we need to turn things around and restore Dragon Day to it's former glory. How do we do this, you ask? 1. Better day. The day before Spring Break, half of campus has already headed back to Westchester and Long Island. Terrible choice of day for a campus holiday.  2. Darties. Drunk kids are important for hyping up things that are typically boring, like sports. They would be great for the parade.  3. More engineering involvement. A gang of red-painted students should be roaming and annoying campus like the Archies. Plenty of strange engineering kids would love to do this. Dear god that Phoenix was depressing. We can do better. This would be a fun project for ENGRI classes to work on to make friends first semester and get some group project experience.  4. Bring back the F I R E. Dragon Day festivities used to build up to the burning of the Dragon and Phoenix. Nothing gets a crowd whipped into a frenzy like some flames.  Any other ideas?  <eos> \n",

I really want to learn how to olympic lift (snatches and cleans) so I was wondering if anyone has experience with PE 1582 as it supposedly teaches them in detail. Also, any other recommendations? I heard climbing was fun and so is sailing. Anyone have any experience with the intro to gymnastics course? <eos> \n",

Ideally, I'd want something related to research, even just in a support position. Are these jobs (and jobs in general) hard to find/get, especially for freshman? Will they ever be posted online or do I just have to contact professors that look like they're doing interesting things? I do intend to have a real research position later on. Additionally, do I really need a mattress topper?? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> We've been getting a lot of questions about the housing lottery and living off campus lately, so I thought we'd have a centralized place to put those in order to avoid repeating questions. There's general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here! **Housing FAQ** * ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?*** I'll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low.  * ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?*** Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option.  * ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?***  Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don't find anything you like there, Googling \"Cornell Apartments\" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I'm a freshman in the CoE studying CS and I just found out the engineering career fair is tomorrow. I looked at the website but I still have a few questions:  What is the attire? What happens when you go to a company's table? Do you have a conversation with them or just give them a resume? Is there any benefit of going to a career fair table rather than just applying online? What is the best plan of action for a freshman trying to get an internship at a large tech company?  What exactly is on campus recruiting? How is it related to the career fair and handshake? Are there any other tips or pointers that would be helpful to anyone who is new to this process?

We are launching a treasure hunt at Cornell in the fall and are still looking to hire some students to help run the treasure hunt. This is a paid position and a VERY fun job as you will actually be hiding gift cards around Campus, collegetown, and working at a fun start-up company! You will get to take gift cards, put them in envelopes, and hide them around! Then you would easily update the campus pursuit smartphone app with hints and clues as to where the gift cards are! Great for anyone who wants to go into marketing, work with new smartphone apps, or who just loves treasure hunts! If you are interested or want to learn more, shoot me an email scott@campuspursuit.com or fill out this form [url link] PS this is going to be CRAZY at Cornell next semester! The Treasure hunt is going on at Ithaca College, SUNY Albany, and SUNY Binghamton as well, expanding to more colleges rapidly. Get ready! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm a community college student in the SUNY system, trying to complete the required coursework for biometry and statistics with my associates just to give admissions a shot. I am very interested in applying mathematics to fields such as psychology and neuroscience. However, my school doesn't have a articulation agreement, and my school(as well as most) doesn't offer statistics as a two course sequence but as one statistics class. In addition my grade for one of my writing classes was a B-. Will Cornell reject me for not having a 2 part statistics class and a B- for half of the English requirement? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> OK, so some time in October my first roommate moved out because one of his friend's roommates was leaving the university. We got a long alright and while he wasn't perfect, he certainly wasn't bad either.This left me with a double to myself for a while, which was pretty nice. When the spring semester began, I got a new roommate. Apparently he was also in a double by himself before, but didn't tell me why (I assumed it was due to some reason similar to mine). But after about a week and a half, I understand why. He snores. So. fucking. loud. This is the fourth straight night it has woken me up in the middle of the night, hence me writing this early in the morning. I tried to me non-confrontational about it but after the 3rd day I let him know what was happening. The other day I asked him to try breathing strips but those didn't work either. This is really starting to affect my day now as I'm losing a lot of sleep and feeling like shit through most of my classes. What can I do? If I go to housing, can anything be done? I really don't want to have to move, considering that a lot of my friends are on my floor and I have a lot of stuff that's very hard to move (futon, TV, etc.). <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I have an interview for a summer research position. I heard the process is less formal than most job/intern positions but I'm not sure how informal (or not) it is.  * Should I wear casual, business casual or full-out formal? * Is it necessary to bring my resume? * What are some questions that usually come up?  * Is summer research worth it?  Any tips or advice would be helpful. I have a sense that this lab isn't rigorous but I'm really anxious since most of my internship/job options are falling through.  (Also, this isn't with the PI. It's with the coordinator(?) if that makes any difference.) <eos> \n",
            "<bos>  I am planning to run for freshman rep. and I was looking at the past results. It's normal for candidates to get 600+ votes or to win in a landslide. I thought maybe it was because they had an older sibling or friend that goes to the school that got them a bunch of votes, but only freshman are allowed to vote in the election. I hardly know more than 15 people. So is the candidate statement really that compelling or have people really managed to become that 'popular' one month into school? Seriously asking this question! Thanks!!  <eos> \n",

If I do have a question it’s something that’s more appropriate to put on the piazza so more people can see it. These are also more intro classes (i.e CS2110), so I don’t feel like I know enough to have a meaningful conversation, but I also don’t have questions to make conversation in that way. Especially since the class is large, I would feel bad for wasting their time when other people need help from them. For 2110 in particular, there is the lunch thing but I always have a lecture then for a hard class. I hope this didn’t come off as humble brag, I just am looking for advice. Suggestions? <eos> \n",

A hub is running under new management at the address ***cornell.ignorelist.com:4000***. To connect, just go to your \"Favorite Hubs\" screen in the DC++ client, and edit the properties so the address field contains the address above.

The current one is that I'm the president of a sports club that, due to a jump in members, essentially needs a basketball court to continue existing, but we can't find a single place that will let us reserve one.  It's irritating to see them bend the rules to give other clubs preferential treatment to use the gyms, but not us.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> throwaway here:  Basically 5 years ago, I found out I failed a required class for my masters right before starting my first job (Job only required a BS, and no one at the company cared). At family insistence, decided to go back and finish it up last semester. Originally, I had a bunch of extra classes approved by my advisor, but apparently requirements had changed over the years; so had to petition to have an extra elective class from undergrad counted towards my masters. Just found out my petition was accepted! Not really sure who to tell as no one I work with knows I was finishing it up, so decided to share here! Interesting note : people called my crazy for taking 23 credits worth of 4XXX level classes (many did not fuifill any requirements my first semester @ Cornell), looks like it ended up being useful!  <eos> \n",

Currently I have planned out for my fall semester these classes: CS/ENGRD2112 MATH1920 ENGRI1620 FWS PE Is this too much? I was thinking about taking the FWS in the spring just so I would have a lighter courseload in the fall and a heavier one in the spring since I have the AP credits to be able to do so. I'm pretty set on taking 2112 which I know is pretty intensive, so I'm not sure if the big three (2112, 1920, 1620) in conjunction with a FWS will prove to be overwhelming as I transition in the fall.

            "<bos> welcome incoming freshmen! you’re probably pretty pumped and i wanted to add to that by saying that cornell feels like a more accommodating place for new/continuing students than it’s ever been.  some things off the top of my head:  - as mentioned in another post, uber/lyft are now allowed in upstate NY which means that you can get a ride to go to target, wegmans, the airport or wherever you want really. without a car back in the day (lol) people had to rely on TCAT to get around town which ran irregularly and was a pain to carry bags or groceries on.  - big red bikes means that if you’re an engineer living in the townhouses or a food science major living on west your life is about to get a LOT easier. downside is incoming students won’t get to know every crack in the sidewalk on east ave or tower road but I think you guys will get over it - greenstar is in collegetown!! it’s been open for a little while now but before this people would have to either bus to wegmans (at least 3 hours total) or settle for the stuff at 7 eleven… - anabel’s grocery is supposed to be opening this summer. if walking to ctown was too far and you’d still like to cook then you can get your groceries right on campus. a lot if not all of the produce is local and prices are apparently very reasonable - safety improvements. i know that prospective students might have read about the rash of assaults in ithaca that have occurred over the past year, which was out of the norm, but i wanted to point out that cornell has been trying to make campus safer. new lighting installed on the slope, i believe more blue lights as well, and the big red shuttle will ferry students around campus from 12 to 3 am on weekends.  - fancy new vending machines in the dorms means you can buy headphones or tylenol or whatever on the go instead of having to trudge all the way to the cornell store in the snow come winter or off-campus…and no longer have to deal with getting everything shipped to you via amazon.  - general lack of construction. i think most of the new apartments in collegetown will be finished by this fall as will the MBA center, and upson should be renovated by then as well. the ag quad will also be newly refurbished. schwartz performing arts center will have a new seating area and patio out front. regardless of what you’re studying you’ll probably get to spend a significant amount of time in at least one state-of-the-art new building.  signed, someone with a lot less to complain about <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello! I'm an incoming freshmen in the college of engineering. I really wanted to take Anatomy and Physiology my first semester. But when I looked through the scheduler, it seems like there is no AP class. I found a comparative AP class but I was more interested in strictly human anatomy for my interests. Has anyone taken human AP at Cornell and knows what to suggest? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm planning to go on the Off-Campus Value meal plan which would mean that I would eat at restaurants more often. Does anyone have recommendations in CTown for good places that I can eat healthy for a relatively low price? I'm open to pretty much anything. Also where would be the best place(s) to buy fresh fruit/veggies in CTown? If all else fails then Wegman's is an option but it's a bit of a pain to get there and back. <eos> \n",

I'm taking the following factors into consideration, in order of importance: 1. workload, 2. applicability/usefulness of learned topics  skills, 3. how interesting the course material is, 4. how interesting/engaging lectures are. <eos> \n",

This is a total shot in the dark, but does anyone have a single room who's looking to be in a double instead? My roommate is a girl and would be staying in the room.

If you have not contacted him already, please contact him through email ( ivylolcornell at gmail dot com ) or through the LoL client (lurkling) This weekend we hope to play Catch the Teemo or some scrims to get to know each other.

            "<bos> Hi everyone, this will probably be a long post but I guess it applies to several other individuals as well. So background info, I was admitted to Cornell for Electrical and Computer Engineering as a freshman. I started off with a very difficult semester and begin to become less and less motivated in terms of what I was studying. To be completely honest, I much more enjoyed taking liberal arts courses in high school then STEM courses. Another thing that decreased my interest in engineering was my acceptance into a project team. Project teams provide students with a real life application and experience in terms of engineering, and I started to notice that compared to the other members who were extremely passionate with their roles, I started to heavily hate the fact that I just wasn't as passionate and wasn't having any fun. I felt like even though I got into a very top project team, it felt more of a burden then fun. One thing that I did seem to grow more interest was in the business subteams. For some reason, what they were doing actually seemed fun to me, and I started to grow more and more interested in business. Rightly so, I started to consider to transfer to AEM or the Hotel School. However, I had no experience in High School with business, and transferring to AEM or the Hotel School is extremely difficult. My next option was considering switching to Arts for Economics, but I'm not sure if majoring in economics will exactly be what I want to do. I feel constricted by the engineering curriculum and dislike the fact that I most likely won't find what I legitimately want to study at all. I considered majoring in OR, which at the moment, somewhat interests me, but I feel like it interests the most out of the other engineering majors because it is the closest to business. I am working to do as best possible as I can in my classes this semester to obtain the highest possible GPA. But I atleast want to start planning for next semester soon so that I can make a smooth transition to whatever I ultimately decide. Thanks so much to those who read this and provide advice. <eos> \n",

He's very wealthy but wouldn't contribute a penny to my college education. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how much financial aid did you receive?  EDIT: Also, according to the Financial Aid calculator I'd get a full ride if my dad's info isn't taken into account. Would use the calculator to find out how much I'd get with his info but it doesn't have anywhere to put non-custodial parent stuff.  <eos> \n",

All of you have lost your fucking way. “Is this class hard? How do I get an internship? How can I improve my grade?” These are all fucking words we’ve made up for ourselves! All fucking made up bullshit manifestations of our own inadequacy. What’s the fucking point? You get bad grades, tough shit, no internship, no job, you die poor. But if you get good grades? Doesn’t fucking matter! You can always fucking fail again and no one will give a fuck that oh fuck this motherfucking asshole got an A+ in Quantum Wines 201949302939193810293 because you’re still a fucking failure and were still all going to die. But now we’re going to die having lived the rest of our lives stressed out and depressed over WHAT? FUCKING NOTHING BUT CONSTRUCTS OF ELITISM AND ACADEMICS FOUNDED ON LIES, LIES, NOTHIG MORE THAN FUCKING LIES  You mother fuckers. This is YOUR doing. It’s because NO ONE HERE knows how to live. It’s fucking IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy life for even a second. Why are we even here? I guarantee if I ask someone why they’re here, why they do the things they do, they can’t answer! And they don’t have an answer! And for the past 18 years I’ve lived this LIE constructed on SAND because of YOU motherFUCKers. You motherfuckers. For the sake of the fucking WORLD, get it the fuck together. I am a lost cause but future generations are not. Please. I’ve shed too many tears for myself and I don’t have any left for others. So a big fat FUCK YOU is all you assholes get. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> As of now I'm pretty set on double majoring in Gov/Phil in CAS and I had a couple questions about scheduling. For GOV I have 5's on Comp and US Gov. so I dont need to take the intro classes but I was wondering how difficult the 3000 level courses in Gov are. Maybe I should wait til second semester to take one of those. For Phil i was thinking of taking intro to PHIL but i heard that most people who major in phil dont actually take that and skip right to a 2000 level class. If so what do you guys recommend at that level for first semester. Lastly I had a question about requirements. The one thing I hate about CAS is the language requirement. I have no interest in langauge and was wondering what langauge you guys think is the easiest / had the best faculty to motivate someone who is dreading taking it.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> 2nd year student looking into grad school at Cornell (and other schools). My main interests are machine learning, or operating systems. End goal is to work in industry (i.e. not do a thesis based masters). - do you enjoy the program overall? - What are the main differences between Cornell tech and Cornell? What solidified your choice between the two? - How would you rate your professors? - Content of the courses, how in depth have you found them? Difficulty of the courses? - I saw that it is possible to get an internship so long as it relates to your degree, have you or anyone in the program done this? - Do you think the overall price is worth it? - How do you like living in NYC (if CT)? Ithaca? - are there reserved residences for graduate students? Anything else you would like to input please feel free to!.  Thanks guys! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys. I'm so glad I'm home right now. I've been really depressed at Cornell. No friends, no nothing. I've been going to Cornell Health which helped somewhat (I mean, my social situation hasn't really improved). I thought I'd meet most of my friends through clubs, but I was pretty much rejected from all the clubs that I had applied to.  I am trying ridiculously hard to get out of this shitty mental state. I tried saying hi, smiling to pretty much every single person in my class (I'm not going to complain actually--I gained a few acquaintances but no real friends).  Last fall term, I spent every single fucking day counting down the days left until the end of the semester. It was fucking painful for me. There were so many times where I'd just wish I could jump off one of the bridges.  A few questions.. Does it get better? Which avenues do you guys recommend for meeting new people? If you went through kinda the same thing I'm going through right now, how did you get through it or cope with it?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Does Cornell have any traditions for when kids turn 21? I'd assume it's just to maybe have a small party with friends in a dorm of collegetown, but was curious because I've heard that at some schools like Georgetown, people write 21 on your head with sharpie and take you to a special local bar for a ton of drinks.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> *god Hi,  I am an incoming freshman, and I recently put together my course schedule. I wanted to fulfill one of my distribution reqs., so I decided to look for some sort of science. When I looked at courses that fit my schedule the only two options were Intro to chem and Why the sky is blue. I've already taken chem in HS, so why take it again. However, Why the sky is blue sounds pretty ridiculous. Anyone take it? Was it not too bad? Thx <eos> \n",

Does anyone have any idea about how flexible Cornell admission officials would be to let me change my major considering that I have taken ECE programming classes (functional and object-oriented) that should count for the basic CS courses at Cornell and have a cumulative GPA of 3.993? I have been highly involved on campus and have had several leadership roles. I have also been actively involved in research in developing programming tools like profilers, compilers, etc. Any perspective on this would be highly appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm taking two 2000 level PHIL classes (Moral Dilemmas in the Law and Intro to Bioethics) and I don't know of any philosophy majors in either! I mean, odds are there's at least a couple but among those I've asked most people just take it as an elective.  Does Logos still exist? I've stopped by GWS 124 at both of the (conflicting) meeting times and there's always been non-Logos activity going on. I tried getting in touch with the person who's email is on the orgsync to no avail. Logos is/was the only Philosophy related club, right? I'd love to make friends in the major and learn more about the department from the student perspective. How can I meet some of you lovely people? Do we have a clubhouse or something? A secret handsign? I need to know. If you're an upperclassman I can get you some sweet free food on West using one of my guest swipes.  <eos> \n",

Ultimately, I think I’d like to get into banking. Arts and Sciences has lots of requirements that are drawing me away from my interests (Econ and CS) and forcing me to take classes I’m uninterested in.

I applied to a few internships earlier this semester, and haven't heard back. (I'm in InfoSci btw) I now plan on applying to more, and being less picky. I'd also like to apply to some research positions here at Cornell. Do most companies pretty much have their summer internship decisions made already, or is there still time to apply? The ones I've been applying to lately are still listed as open, but I'm not sure if that means that they are really still looking at applications. I'd appreciate any insight you guys can give! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have been kinda afraid of the foreign language requirement because I've never been too strong with language, so I put it off until next semester(sophomore year), but now I realize that I need to complete it. I was originally going to take Spanish because it was the most practical and the closest to English. But I don't really have too much interest in Spanish unfortunately, and heard the class was one of the more difficult language classes. Could anyone recommend a language that isn't super intensive that you liked learning at Cornell? I'm not really interested in any foreign language, so I'm not quite sure what to do, but finding a language I'd enjoy learning would be pretty great.  <eos> \n",

My grades are on the lower end for Cornell (3.8 UW), but my SATs are better (2310, 720  710 on subject tests). I'm applying to engineering. Lots of engineering ECs, but I like doing other sports/clubs for recreation and keep myself sane. For the Cornell supplement, I tried to be as specific as possible. Would you recommend the primary/alternate option? Also, I might (95% chance) be a coauthor on a published research paper- can that counter my lowish GPA? Are there any engineering students here familiar with Cornell's FSAE team, and/or the autonomous underwater robotics team (AUVSI)? I'm interested in working on robotics as a career. Any advice would be helpful at this point Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I applied to CALS for the class of 2017, and I was offed a guaranteed transfer after one school year. I was wondering if anyone is a transfer student or knows a transfer student? Do you have the flexibility to leave your major or double major? Do you still get financial aid? Do you at all feel at all like a second class citizen? Do you just have any general comments on my situation? I got a full tuition scholarship to a selective liberal arts college, and great aid packages from the sunys, and I will likely go to one of them for freshmen year. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi I am taking Math 1110 this freshman semester, and I don't think I did that well. Is there anyone who had taken the course before and could you tell me how is the class curve? For example, this year the class has 650 points from sections, online hw, written hw, prelim 12, and finals. So does anyone know if you get a 500-550, what should you get? or in other words if your real score is 70-80, what is your score after the curve? Thanks!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a new sophomore transfer, and I'm really struggling socially- it's been two months and I don't have a single friend. I didn't have friends at my old school (or high school...), and I really hoped that Cornell would be a fresh start and I would finally \"find my people\". I joined clubs that I'm interested in, I talked to people during orientation, but nothing really panned out and now I feel like everyone has settled into a routine and isn't actively looking for new friends. I know that I have a lot of underlying social anxiety/self esteem issues that are holding me back, so I'm trying to figure out how to get through that. Therapy was something my parents wanted me to look into when I was having similar problems at my old school, so I called Cornell Health counseling last week, but they told me it would be over a month before I could make an appointment. I don't want to go to EARS or any of that bullshit, but I don't know what my other options are. I can feel myself slipping back into the same depressive cycle I was in last year, and while I really don't want that to happen I don't know how to prevent it. Seeing everyone with their friends at homecoming and halloween parties makes me want to cry because I feel like I'll never get to have those experiences. :( <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi there! i'm a guaranteed Transfer who has completed one year at another university, and I'm looking to see how feasible it would be to graduate ILR in two years, as my parents are taking out a lot of loans and I would love to reduce that burden if possible.  I'm coming in with Macro/Micro/One FWS/Stat done, as well as my western intellectual tradition, Science and Technology, and Cultural Perspectives credit.  Based on this: [url link] It seems like I only need 40 Credits in ILR Electives, and a couple more required classes, which should total 63 credits or so. But if I have two years (15 a semester=60 for the year) I should be able to squeeze it all in with two years correct? I'm trying to see if there's something i'm missing, or if there's a reason more ILR students don't graduate in three years. Graduating early would be a huge burden lifted financially for my family, so if this is possible I 100% want to do it.  <eos> \n",

Which bus service would you recommend between C2C, Big Red Bullet, or Short line if I have to get to JFK by 12 AM on the 25th for my flight?

From your 2017-2018 academic calendar I read that there is a fall recess from october 7 to 16.  Are midterms going to happen in these two weeks? Is it a good time to come? Do you have any suggestion on the right time to visit in the fall semester?  Thank you so much in advance! <eos> \n",

Is a roommate better than no roommate?  What are the best places to eat on campus? More specifically, the ag quad (where I will have a lot of my classes), north campus, and the main campus?  What are some of the most interesting/fun/awesome classes to take? What are some of the best clubs/organizations to join? (obviously this will vary by person depending on interests) Is getting a bike a good idea? In comparison to other schools, how big is the drinking scene on campus? Will I be seeing lots of throw up whenever I walk back into my residence hall? (I'm an emetophobic so this is a weird question for some...) Assuming you had a big courseload senior year of high school, how difficult is the homework/work in general in comparison?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Despite researching Cornell extensively and attending the information sessions/tours, I had never heard of this before (not even my school counselor mentioned it to me):  Applicants to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, and College of Human Ecology may be considered for January 2018 admission. Learn more about the First-Year Spring Admission program online at: admissions.cornell.edu/fysa. In addition to being considered for Fall 2017, I am interested in First Year Spring Admission in January 2018. * The link it gave here is broken, but i was able to find the correct one [here.]([url link] However, I'm still a bit confused... What exactly does this mean? Is it essentially a \"second chance\" at admissions if you do not get accepted for the Fall due to number of admitted students? Are there any \"catches\" to it? e.g. restrictions/does it affect the Fall admissions process? Thanks in advance for the help (: <eos> \n",

I got a 4 on the AP Calc AB exam as a junior, and didn't take another calc class as a senior. I was wondering whether I should take the as math courses or engineering math courses for cs. Is there a difficulty in difficulty, application to computer science, grading curve or theory vs practically? Does one or the other look better for employers or people I would seek an internship with? Also, what opportunities to Cornell cs students typically take advantage of on campus (undergrad research etc), and how can I get involved in these or prepare for these as soon as possible. Thanks a lot guys, I love this helpful and friendly Cornell community on Reddit! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Is it realistic to negotiate housing prices for next year if you're dealing with an established Ithaca company that has prices on their sites? If so, how far down are they usually able to go?

Now to get into it, I'm not sure what course to take next semester. On the one hand, it's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that you should take Honors Analysis if you're considering grad school which I think I'd do if I did math (again, I swear I know I'm late hahaha). On the other hand, I'm not all that comfortable with proofs so I don't want to go into the class and then drown in unpreparedness. Still, doing Non honors intro analysis prevents you from being able to move into the next honors analysis class which would suck.  Wondering if anyone has advice as for where to go from here. Are there perhaps books you think are good on math proofs that I could read over the summer and prepare myself for writing more rigorous proofs? On the complete other hand, I don't think I'm much of a fan of the analysis side of math and think I'd prefer the algebra side. That said, I'm not sure of whether or not to take the analysis track first or the algebra track. Of course, it would be nice to take both concurrently but there's essentially zero chance of me being able to take both an honors analysis AND honors algebra with my current level of mathematical prowess. Perhaps I should take one honors next semester and one non-honors? The main problem is I'm running out of time, but if I'm considering grad school I'd like to take as many math courses as I can in the next two years. Thanks a bunch if you've read this far, I appreciate any help you can give!  <eos> \n",

I was planning to pick residential hall as my first choice, but Risley caught my eye as a program house that might actually apply to me. If anyone is willing to chat and answer a few questions about it, please let me know! I'm particularly interested to hear from non-art/architecture majors. Also, I'll be going to Cornell Days on the 20th, but am hanging around campus with my (hopefully) future roommate that weekend. I know it's prelim time for most students, but if you have some time to meet up and show me around Risley on the 18th or 19th, I'd greatly appreciate that too! <eos> \n",

I'm interested in the FARE concentration, more specifically the Securities Analysis/Investment Banking track. I've posting this today to see if I will be barred from opportunities in Investment banking upon graduating. I have narrowed down my transfer selection to Vanderbilt(Economics) and Cornell(SHA), and even though Cornell graduates have great job opportunities through Dyson, I'm not sure that a degree from HSA is as valuable to me as an economics degree elsewhere.

Basically the title - the university website is really vague when it comes to curriculum structure, so can I get some info about how the curriculum, especially the \"foundational courses,\" work as one progresses each year? Do these foundational courses work like a mandatory common curriculum?

My portion of the project is to analyze and evaluate a current issue (from Cornell) from the past 3 years. Would anyone be kind enough to point me to some current issues and maybe some places to get good information on it? It doesn't need to be a scandalous issue or anything negative about Cornell, of course! Just something that's been a big deal to you - if the project was on my own university, for example, I could look at an experimental initiative for mixed-gender floors on the dorms (currently there are male floors and female floors).

            "<bos> Hello, I'm a student interested in transferring to Cornell. Right now, I'm a freshman majoring in physics at a top 50-60 USNEWS school. I’d like to major in Chemical Engineering (my current school does not offer the major). I’m interested more in the biological side of things, i.e. biotech/biochemical engineering, and in modeling and simulation (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations, and other computational stuff). Ultimately, working in research, either through grad school/academia or industry/startup is the goal. Academically, I’m doing well at my school (3.93/4.0 GPA), participate in extracurricular activities and am working in a lab as an assistant (computational physics lab). My HS grades were alright (3.7 UW GPA), and I retook my SATs for a higher score. My main questions are about the ChemE department. I’d just like to get any idea of it (or the engineering school) from a student’s perspective. Beyond that, any information on Cornell in general, the atmosphere of the school, Ithaca, and transferring would be very helpful. How have you liked Cornell so far, and would you recommend transferring (if you are someone or know somebody who has)? Also, if someone could provide any insight on transferring credits- I skipped a good amount of courses through AP credit and placement exams at my current school, but I don’t know how that would work with Cornell (Cornell doesn't accept some AP credits that my school does). Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all I was recently accepted into and committed to Cornell! My major at Cornell is ILR.  The reason I am worried is that I want to go into finance (IBanking), and although Cornell is a target school for this (as apposed to a semi target for my former school), I didn't know how little the curriculum was targeting finance. Although I love the interdisciplinary education, I was hoping it would center more around finance and economics. Once my dad showed me the career report for ILR I started freaking out a bit. My plan is to major in ILR and get minors in Business and Econ. But because of my new found stress I have been looking around and I realized that in order to go from a minor in Econ to a Major I only need to take three more classes.  I am thinking of now double majoring in ILR and Econ or switching into Econ itself and just using all my electives in finance/econ classes.  Can anyone speak to how open Cornell is to double majors, especially as a transfer? I saw some info in CALS but nothing about between CAS and ILR. Thanks, stressed future cornell kid  <eos> \n",

I was hoping I could feel you guys out for the interest level in such a club. I imagine once a month of every two weeks meetings where maybe we do some tutorials, share ideas, beers and the like. I've already searched the food science faculty and there is at least one person I think would make a very knowledgeable advisor, if we could convince him to help us out. Thoughts? <eos> \n",

Wondering if the following sounds like a realistic approach: - already done 2110 FA18: - 3110 - 2800 - ECE 2300 (prereq to 3420) - 4320 - 4154 (this is actually for my major to finish it off) SP18: - 4700 - 3420 - MATH 2210 (just feel like this is useful to know) - 4152 (I’m doing 3152) Goal is to do some interesting classes in my last year since I don’t want to waste it away, but at the same time not screw myself into an unrealistic schedule that can kill my GPA. <eos> \n",

Unfortunately, the link to the surveys requires a Cornell netid. This is important to him because our large state flagship generally sends almost all its engineering students to maybe 4-5 major companies and he would like to avoid being pigeon-holed with his college selection. Is there any way you could PM me the pdf of the survey?     If this is not allowed or invasive to the Cornell community, my sincere apologies. That is far from my intentions. Personal anecdotes about where students intern would be appreciated as well. Thank you in advance! <eos> \n",

I am wondering if anyone has any insight into the MEng program (Engineering Management in particular) or can refer me to someone who is. What is the program like in terms of rigour and useful content? Opinions on the quality of professors, other students, resources like career services, etc? <eos> \n",

She isn't sure what she wants to major in but loves science so she's probably be applying to the arts and sciences school. The camp is Saturday and Sunday, but she gets in at 10am on Friday so she has all day to explore.  We're from the west coast so I am sure she will find many things that aren't desert and cacti a novelty. She loves the outdoors as well.  Any advice or suggestions would be great!! <eos> \n",

The way they are listed is quite unorganized, making it hard to keep track of which requirements you have completed and which you still need to.

            "<bos> Hi, I was recently admitted to Cornell to study computer science in the school of arts and sciences, and I have a bunch of questions that I would like to have answered by any current CS majors there:  1) How big are lower level class sizes? What about upper level class sizes?  2) How easy is it to get to know your professors since Cornell is so big?  3) How easy is it to find research positions with Cornell professors?  4) What kind of computer science clubs/activities are there to participate in?  5) Is it possible for me to become a TA for a lower division computer science class? What is the process like for me to become one? Is the selection process competitive?  6) Do most students get internships after freshman year? How do most students find their internships?  7) What are the differences between the CS degree from arts and sciences and from the engineering school? Is either one preferred by employers?  8) What classes do I have to take before I can affiliate with the CS major? Is it possible to affiliate with the major right after I finish my first semester?  9) How hard is it to transfer from arts and sciences to the engineering school? Could I transfer right after my first semester? What classes would I need to take to do that? (I have AP credit in Calculus BC, Chemistry, Physics and Computer Science)  10) How many people per graduating class study CS?  11) How popular is the Co-op program?  12) What do you do for fun? <eos> \n",

On one hand, it's a fantastic, all-expenses paid opportunity; on the other, it's two months gone out of the little time I have left with all of my friends. I'm extremely torn. I have a friend who said he's very happy he chose not to attend, and I'm currently looking for the other three cases: unhappy they didn't attend, happy they did, unhappy they did. And help is much appreciated. <eos> \n",

I was wondering how well each of these work with RedRover. Since our activity is tracked by MAC address instead of IP, is TOR rendered useless as far as Cornell is concerned?

On the first project, I managed to score about 5 points above the mean, but the grades on the second project were just released and I scored ~20 below... We've got an exam coming up and I'm terrified. I always do awfully on CS exams for some reason, despite going in and feeling like I understand the material. For example, in 1110 and 3410, on all exams I was at least 10 points below the mean if not 15-30. Does anybody have advice for this class? I've started all 3 projects literally the day they were released and have been trying to keep up with the material, but it's just so much to take in. I've also been going to office hours as much as I can, though I think I should have attended more for the second assignment. <eos> \n",

My GF might be attending Cornell for grad school in the Fall, and so we are starting a preliminary look at housing options. One must-have for me is high speed internet (If we move, I'll be doing full-time telework.)  I saw that Ithaca is mostly covered by Time Warner Cable. Their website seems to indicate that the top plan they offer is 50/5Mbps. I'm currently getting 150/150Mbps from FiOS, so, that's one heck of a drop. Is there anything faster around? <eos> \n",

Are we allowed to leave for a period of time for family events?  2. How would you describe the courseload for the School of Hotel Administration?  3. Why should I pick Cornell?  4.

Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of getting selected? If there are any current TAs on here who can talk about their experience that would be very helpful. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I am a rising sophomore wishing to double major in math and cs. How should I plan out my remaining 3 years to make sure I can graduate with both? I have already taken 2110+2800 last year. If I choose to do math major with cs concentration, should this double major be doable? (i.e. how much extra work is it?) Also, how many cs and math courses should I on average take each semester? I didn't come in with a lot of AP credit so I have to fulfill liberal arts reqs too (in Arts and Sciences). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> From everything I've heard Sprint has virtually no cell service in Ithaca. However, I understand that they've recently updated their service and (according to their website: [url link] Ithaca now has excellent coverage with Sprint.  Seeing as this change has been pretty recent, and with Sprint never being a viable option until now, it's difficult to get any first-hand accounts of how service has been in-town since that time. Would anyone on here currently be using Spring, or know someone who is? I'll be moving for grad school in ~2 weeks so I'd like to know before then if it's actually necessary for me to switch carriers. Thanks in advance, and my apologies for further inundating this subreddit with questions about cell service! <eos> \n",

I didn't try as hard as I should have my freshman year. I know that if I put my mind to it I could get close to a 4 at my school James Madison University for the next 2 semesters.

I am past my nightlife/party phase so being close to bars is not a priority, and roommates are not an option. I also have a car, so commuting from somewhere more rural is an option. So a few questions: * When is the best time to start looking? As is, I may be able to fly into Syracuse affordably in May/June for a few days and drive down. Is that too late, or is July the best time to look? * A lot of the complexes I've found online near central Ithaca are charging extra for a parking spot (What?!). Does this mean it's better to outside Ithaca? What are the downsides to commuting? I do plan on working on my car, so there is that to consider... * Not knowing the neighborhoods of Ithaca well, I've heard \"Fall Creek\" and \"Cayuga Heights\" as places to live. Anywhere else I should look or are recommended as places to live? Thanks, Cornell. <eos> \n",

I currently receive financial aid in grants and loans for the Fall and Spring terms.  If I do stay I'm planning on taking two 3 credit courses, which is required to apply for aid. I also want to TA a class or two, if possible.

Describing it simply, it has a ton of locations around campus with hours/details/arrivals/menus/etc. that I can live update with information and that you can find easily for when you're walking around campus. It has a one-time cost of 99 cents, but please check out the app-descriptions and see if you think it's worth it. I started this project to use for myself and just wanted to bring it to others, so I will continue updating it and making it even better.

I’ve met so many great people and had so many new experiences. And while I feel work starting to pick up and prelim season is right around the corner, I feel so glad to be here.

It didn't stop me from affiliating and I've been procrastinating taking PHYS 2213 and I can't find a clear answer on whether I need to retake PHYS 1112 in order to take PHYS 2213/graduate.  I was able to sign up for PHYS 2213 for the fall but if I need to retake PHYS 1112 then I'll do it this fall and take 2213 in the spring but there's no way I'm going to retake the class if I don't have to.

For Chemistry 2090, my final grade was soooooo much lower than I expected, and that real destroyed my GPA. Now I know this will put me under poor academic standing, so what will happen next? I passed all my classes, and in particular I got a D, C, C, B-. For next semester, I really fixed my schedule so that I can appropriate a more efficient pattern of studying and sleeping, and I have already started to study for my next semester classes. I am not at all worried or scared and I know that I can fix all of my mistakes from this semester in my next semester. However, in the long wrong, how will this affect me?

I just received an email from Dyson Admissions and was informed that I would not be accepted for fall 2018 from the wait list but that I would be given a Transfer Option (TO) to Cornell. I was wondering whether if I accepted this option, enrolled full-time at a an accredited university, and earned the grades that I am expected to get as indicated on the email, I could assume that I would be accepted as a transfer. I really would love to attend the Dyson school so I guess that I am just asking whether I could call this offer a \"guaranteed tranfer option,\" assuming that I meet all of the criteria expected of me.

That's what the class is curved to, I think. damn this class was memorization heavy. What did you guys think? Is a B- ok for a first year premed? Lol <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just thinking about the future, but whenever I talk to an older friend of mine, she always tells me to choose a job that I like. So when I got a summer job offer at a place I wasn't sure about, she told me not to accept it if I really didn't feel sure about it. However, I feel like my skills are really poor compared to my peers and so I am not able to exactly \"choose\" where I want to work. I would love to work at the places I dream of but honestly, I feel like since I'm so bad compared to everyone else I'll have to just work at anywhere that accepts me.  Not sure what I'm trying to ask or get here but any advice, opinions, or experiences on jobs after graduating from Cornell will be greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, So I am a freshman planning to affiliate as a CS major next year. Right now I'm taking 2110 and 2800, and although I am doing fine in 2110, I recently did not do so well on the first prelim for 2800 (got around B-). I know that if I try really hard that I can boost my grade to maybe a B+ by the end, but the content is getting more difficult and I don't know... My GPA was not so good last semester, so I wanna do pretty well on this one. Should I drop 2800 and take it again next semester? I'm pretty confident that I can do much better... <eos> \n",

Despite choosing a school with a shittier Hockey Team, Tyson is on his way to joining the ranks of America's favorite scientists.  *Cornell Challenge for Sept. 29:*  5 pts: What location today once held the institution referred to in the earliest of Carl Sagan's few Cornell Daily Sun mentions? 10 pts: Legend has it that Carl Sagan lived in either two of these properties.

            "<bos> Schools: Cornell or Carnegie Mellon Cost: Roughly same Major: ECE (potentially premed as well) I am having trouble deciding between these two universities for this major. Cornell seems to be a slightly better school by the number rankings but is not really ahead of CMU. -CMU has about 130 ECE graduates, Cornell has about 80 -worried about grade deflation for pre med -worried that ece department at CMU is overshadowed by their amazing computer science department. Also that people who don’t get into SCS at CMU use ECE as a backup and aren’t actually interested in major itself -really want to have internship opportunities in college as early as after freshman year -want to work on project teams like robotics clubs -want to do research -worried that Greek life is overbearing at Cornell. Is this the case for engineers? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was wondering if some grad student lurkers could help me out here? So I used the StudentCenter portal to send a sealed official transcript to a different graduate school about a week ago, but I just received word from them that the transcript they received contains neither the degree name nor the date of conferral. This seems strange, since I graduated from Cornell about three weeks ago. Have they just not put this on the transcript yet, or am I supposed to use something other than StudentCenter (i.e. Parchment) to send this? ---- [UPDATE 10:10 AM EDT 2017/06/15] I'm an idiot. Called up the Registrar and they told me that degree/date of conferral was added as of June 12. Just downloaded a the student e-Transcript and saw it for myself (the earlier one from last week didn't have that information). Should have just waited to send the official transcript... now I have to send another one. &lt; Good thing they're free lol. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If I took Math 2210 and Math 2220 instead of the honors versions, would taking honors real analysis this next semester be too much of a jump? I'm a Math major and have heard that I should probably take the honors version if I ever decide I want to do phd type work (which I might want to do but still not sure about), but I'm just a little afraid that I don't have enough experience with proofs yet to take 4130. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Just looking for general information about the college beyond the website. Individual experiences and opinions highly encouraged! EDIT 1: To those advising me on my major, I probably should have mentioned that my goal will be an ROTC scholarship to pay for my tuition, with my first few years in the workforce to be served in the armed forces. Then, possibly law. But thank you to those who assumed I would be eating my own theses for survival. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I need 9 credits of writing for CALS, and I completed 6 credits doing FWS classes, but next semester I would like to possibly take a class that isn't a FWS (maybe as S/U). I also don't want to take an oral communications class (even if it would be helpful and count toward the requirement). I guess I'm looking for a class that participation doesn't matter as much and isn't overly time consuming for 3 credits. Thanks! Side question: Has anyone taken PHYS1101: General Physics I before and could tell me anything about it? <eos> \n",

That said, I don't want a B, and I have no clue what this guy wants from me because he's somewhat difficult to follow. Any advice? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm not planning on using any AP credit (medical schools don't take it anyway) so do I still have to send in my AP scores? It's expensive so I'd rather not if it isn't required. I only ask because I reported them on my common app so I'm worried I might have to prove it.  Edit: I'm just going to send them in. I realized it's $15 *per report* and not $15 per score like one of my dingbat friends told me. Thank you to everyone for advising me. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For those who are majoring in physics...which math sequence is the best suited for the typical physics major: 1910-1920-2930-2940 (i.e. engineering math sequence), 1110-1120-2210-2220 (AS math sequence), or 2230-2240 (theoretical sequence)?  The AS and theoretical math sequences require linear algebra before multivariable calculus. While this may be pedagogically nice, it is a bit out of sequence as the Physics EM (e.g. Phys 2170) will make heavy use of multivariable calculus right off the bat. I'm looking for experiences for students who may have gone through this and may be able to provide retrospective insight. Thanks! Bill <eos> \n",

The official Cornell website suggests that \"it is smart to add and completely finish enrolling in one course at a time, starting with the most popular one.\" Does that mean my shopping cart will reset on July 6th and that I'll have to add my courses all over again? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I’m planning on taking an astronomy class in the fall to satisfy the PBS distribution requirement for Arts and Sciences. I’m not sure whether I should take 1101 or 2212. I’ve heard that 1101 is pretty easy and has a nice grading system. I’m also considering 2212 because I’m interested in the more physics based side of astronomy. Although I saw on the syllabus from a previous semester that there’s a big project at the end of the semester that counts as a pretty significant portion of the grade. Does anyone have any experience with these classes and can attest to the content, differences in difficulty, etc.? <eos> \n",

The courses in question are: CS 4410, CS 4820, CS 4700 + practicum, CS 4xxx (for my Renaissance vector - easier the better! have already taken 4740), CS 4852, Linear Algebra, S/U liberal arts course, HADM 1810 I want to take these courses, 4 per semester, in Spring 2017 and Fall 2017. I'm having trouble balancing the difficulty across these two semesters, so any advice as to how to schedule this would be appreciated. Any suggestions for the easiest 4000 level CS course? Also, please note that I consider Linear Algebra a difficult course, as I've never been strong in math. Thank you! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> It's been two months since I transferred into Cornell and I feel like I'm not accomplishing anything. I did shitty on my first prelim season but I feel like that was a combination of getting used to Cornell's back to back prelim season along with me not knowing what and how to study with two exams on the same day with a project due and then having an exam the day after in class and an exam at night. I just don't know what to do at this point other than figure out what to do next prelim season other than just study more and hoping for the fact that I can do better since the prelims are more spread out. The one thing I just don't know what to do about is BEE 2600, which is Principles of Biological Engineering. The class isn't hard but it honestly feels like I'm fighting myself and the the head TA on everything. The project we did for the class had errors with the numbers and units and was incomplete and unless you showed up to TA hours you wouldn't be able to figure out the project was impossible to do. The TAs didn't even know there were errors and couldn't get the information or directions from the Head TA who was supposed to be at office hours at that time. That pretty much forced me and my group to spend that day and the day after trying to figure out what we can and cannot do for the case study since no one knew how to actually do the case study. Then, there are the prelims for the class which we just got back from the Head TA, so even if I wanted to drop the class I can't, and this was the one thing I thought I did good on and was one of the easier exams I took and I found it I did poorly on it too. I don't even blame the professor or the class itself, I just feel like I'm blaming the Head TA for everything. I can't even distract myself on the weekends from all of this because I just feel like I don't have anything to do or anyone to hang out with. I just sleep most of the day on Saturday and do most of my problem sets before sitting in my dorm doing nothing. On Sundays I pretty much just do nothing but wait for class to start.   I don't know what I want from this post but I just need advice about anything <eos> \n",

I've been thinking of taking a mental health leave of absence because of my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, but I really feel like that would make things worse. I don't have anywhere to go if I don't stay in school (home isn't an option - it's bad there too). I've tried CAPS and they don't want to facilitate weekly meetings but switching to an outside provider seems so difficult, not to mention I'm unsure if I could afford co-pays. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do? I've been thinking perhaps group therapy, but I haven't found any. A lot of my depression stems from loneliness, and it's been really hard to meet people. I'm a sophomore right now, and honestly, I just don't want to come back to Cornell next year. I don't know what to do at this point, and just feel hopeless, but also incredibly guilty, because so many people would love to be in my place, yet I want to leave. <eos> \n",

From class roster, I just see differences like time, instructor, expense, etc, but not very informative and direct.  Which one should I take? Just worry that the former one may be too gentle and the latter may be too violent.... I wonder if anyone has taken any one of them and can share some comments/advice (like how do they train/practice)? Thanks!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So my first semester of freshman year didn't go great, but I told myself some bullshit along the lines of I'm still adjusting to college blah blah, it's ok, I'll only go up from here, etc. Second semester was a bit better, although looking at my transcript, it's only because my classes had slightly higher median grades, I was still the same amount below the median as before... Anyway, I still felt decently optimistic and told myself third semester was gonna be the best one yet!!! Now that it's over, I've come to the conclusion that I'm simply stupid. It seems as though the difference between me genuinely trying to do better vs losing hope and aiming for bare minimum is pretty negligible, which isn't doing wonders for my motivation going forward... Anyone have any tips for trying to suck a bit less/getting out of this mindset? Also any tips for making myself seem at least semi competent when applying for internships would be appreciated.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm transferring in as a sophomore to CAS and I so far don't have an on-campus housing assignment. I got an email saying  \"If space should become available, it would mean a space within temporary housing in a quintuple in a first-year residence hall on North Campus, and space will be limited. If you are assigned to a temporary space, we would continue to work to find you a permanent space on campus through the coming months as spaces across campus become available.\" Is that preferable to renting an apartment off-campus, in Collegetown or maybe Fall Creek? Should I start looking now or continue to wait and hope I get temporary housing and eventually a permanent place?  My understanding is that North Campus is far from most of the classes and quintuples are going to be very cramped and uncomfortable. But coming in as a transfer, I'm a little worried about the social aspect of living off-campus as a sophomore, even though I have a roommate in mind. <eos> \n",

Cornell has also allowed me to upload supplementary materials so do I upload my letter there?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey, I'm transferring into Cornell this Spring and had a few small questions that I was having trouble getting the answers to. 1. How's the Cascadilla dorm? I requested West Campus Housing but got 'dumped' across the river over there, hah! I've heard that it's super social from some people, and that it's removed and lonely from others. 2. How do you say 'Cascadilla', I'm from the Southwest so I'd say 'Cask-a-diya' (like Quesadilla), but it might be \"Cask-a-dill-a\"? 3. I signed up for the 'unlimited meals' meal plan, as I can't afford to eat out and hate cooking with a passion (worked as a chef, long story), is it a pain to get over to West Campus to eat? 4. How much is a membership at the campus health club? Do they have a sauna? 5. I'm transferring in as a Junior, too late to join a Fraternity? Any suggestions on which one? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I know there’s an early admit option for current UGs but it requires that you have 1-8 credits left to complete to get your BS degree. What if you have more than 8 credits? Do you have to take the GREs and what not like all the non Cornell applicants? Also, if you’re going to get an MEng in a field you’re already majoring in, and the requirements for the MEng are basically the courses you have taken or are going to take for your BS, do you just get to take electives instead? This is for Materials Science Engineering.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys! Prospective student here. I am very interested in Cornell’s mechanical engineering program, yet I was wondering if it offers a program that is similar to industrial or product design? Maybe as a combination of majors (like engineering and design)? Or something of the sort? Please advise! I have a portfolio and I’m a pretty good artist. II would ultimately like to do product designer in the future. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I will be a rising senior this fall. My parents always tell me to \"take advantage\" of all the resources at Cornell, and I've seen this sentiment expressed online many times as well. To be honest, I'm not really sure I've been doing this, and I'm not sure how to.  I mean yeah, I readily agree that some of the classes and professors here are world class, and I've been able to get internships I probably wouldn't have gotten at another college. But I always have a guilty feeling at the back of my mind that I should always be doing something more to extract full value from Cornell. Anyone else feel similar to this?  <eos> \n",

I received AP credit for the class but am wondering if as a MechE it would be advised that I retake it in order to cement my knowledge for higher level classes. I have spoken to different advisers and they all seem to say \"do whatever you think is best,\" which is annoying so I was hoping some upperclassmen MechEs can chime in.  <eos> \n",

Do we all just split off and try and grab any rooms that we can? Is it possible to get into any of the West Campus halls excluding the Gothics?  Edit: Also, is it possible to grab a single or a double in Sheldon or Cascadilla in that time slot? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The first semester of my freshman year, I was lugging around thick textbooks and handing in physical homework for every class but my fws. Now, I have no physical textbooks and only one class where I have to turn in physical homework. It's incredibly convenient, I now have access to almost everything I need at all times just by carrying around my laptop. I'm definitely glad things have changed since when I first started, but that was a little more than a year ago. I'm just a sophomore. Are things really changing that fast? Did the whole school go from mostly on paper to mostly in computers in a year or two? Or is it that the freshman classes are behind for some reason? Maybe it's just a coincidence that has to do with my class schedule? <eos> \n",

The projects look very interesting, but they are so intense that I'm beginning to have second thoughts. How much time is typically spent on this course? What are the advantages of taking it over 2110? Do tech companies care that I took one or the other? Will it make me into a really good programmer? Is it just a fantastic class? The class looks so interesting but I don't want to destroy my gpa my first semester and have no time. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> There are so many CS majors here that make getting the major such a painful experience. I know this definitely happens in other majors, probably in STEM the most, but I'm just gonna rant about CS. Too many people at Cornell derive their self worth from their academic performance and professional aspirations. These are probably the same people that can't carry a conversation about anything that isn't technical. I feel like in college, a lot of CS majors lose sight of the fact that life is so much more than your education+career, because that's all they focus on during their 4 years here.  The thing that really bothers me is why it becomes so damn competitive. People in the CS major here relentlessly talk about test scores, GPAs, internships, projects, connections, etc. So much of it is humblebrag and its honestly disgusting. \"oh, that project took you more than 30 seconds? dude are you sure you wanna do CS?\" \"you don't have a 4.33? I feel like they practically hand out A+'s here\" \"why would they even write a prelim that easy? I wrote answer key on the top of mine\" \"lmao you live in collegetown? I've been living in the cocktail lounge for 2.5 years\" \"you haven't worked at google and Facebook and microsoft yet? maybe cornell isn't for you\" \"yah i earn 6 figures a minute, but I'm looking for a better paying job idk\" It's \"cool\" here to torture yourself until you get some job for a company that doesn't care about you, just so you can tell people you make a lot of $$ and work at some huge corporation that everyone knows.  go big red   <eos> \n",

Just wondering if anyone can share their experiences as a LGBTQ student on campus, how easy It was to find people within the community, etc. I'm going to Cornell next year but I'm not the sort of person that has ever joined LGBTQ clubs so I don't think I am going to meet people through organizations when I'm on campus.  <eos> \n",

I am leaning towards Center Ithaca due to price. Does anyone have any input/feedback on these locations (Coal Yard vs. Center Ithaca)? Or maybe another location that I should be looking at? Any help is really appreciated as I have to sign without viewing. For reference, I am a 27yo female with a car. Looked at CTT, but too expensive for me. Targeting $1400 or less. Thanks! <eos> \n",

It would fulfill a liberal studies rec, and I have a relatively easy (13 other credits) semester- would this still be too much of a challenge?

Also, on a completely separate note, how is the party life at Cornell? I partied a lot during freshman year, and I want to continue that tradition into my new uni. Does Cornell host lots of parties or is the university's social scene centered on academics? TYSM.  <eos> \n",

I confess, I love Cornell's gorgeous campus and surrounding area, the top notch Engineering college, decent dining options, Bill Nye the Science Guy, the Great Pumpkin Prank.

I was looking to take grad Qmech and EM but AEP doesn't seem to have those courses at the grad level. Do we take those courses from physics? Could someone let me know what courses AEP first year grads usually take and if there is some online resource to refer to when making the decision. Moreover when does one need to register for the courses? Can we register for courses even in August or do the classes get filled up quite early?  If you are an AEP grad student could you also tell how grad students generally spend their first year and also maybe give some advice for an incoming first year student. Thanks. <eos> \n",

I used to be a pre-vet but I dropped that because I realized that I was more passionate about ecology/zoology/ornithology and currently want to go to grad school for one of these fields (It might be worth noting that I'm currently leaning more towards ecology/ornithology than zoology). Now that I no longer want to go to vet school I see no reason to take 3570/80. Should I stick it out, or drop 3570 to take 1570 next semester instead? Will grad schools look down on me taking \"baby orgo\"? I don't think the content is too hard yet but I'm afraid that it will kick me in the butt later in the semester/year.  <eos> \n",

I took 3 years of Spanish in hs, but part of the reason why I delayed is that it my Spanish is very, very rusty and doesn't hold up. Frankly, I have almost no desire to go back to it in a classroom setting at this point. I've tried to refresh over the break, but I just couldn't engage with it at all. High school left a bad taste in my mouth. I've had the idea of learning german in the back of my head for about two years now and dabbled in it a bit. I've always been interested in german history and culture and I think this is the road I want to take. Friends of mine that took a completely new language at Cornell also found it rewarding. Does anyone have any experience with the german studies department? Any opinions/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",

I tried to go into my Cornell email settings and fix this, but the settings said they weren’t forwarding to anything even though I still am getting these bounce backs. Does anyone know what’s wrong or if there is somewhere I can go on campus to get help with this problem <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I haven't seen anything about an Ithaca Barcraft on Reddit before, but I hope it would be a hit. I talked to the owner of 2nd Floor Bar in the Commons tonight, and he seemed very interested. For those not in the know, \"Barcraft\" is where a bunch of people go to a bar to drink and watch a professional Starcraft tournament together. It's tons of fun. **EDIT:** I know it's late notice, but this won't be happening in time for Providence. The guy at Pixel never got back to me, the guy at 2nd Floor finally did, but only a week ago, and I figured it was too short notice to get everything up and running and get the word out. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm thinking of transferring into the college of engineering for Cornell from a large mid tier ranked state school (around 50). I didn't do well in high school, I got a 3.5 gpa and a 30 act.  If I get a 4.0 gpa during my freshman year in college do you think I will have a chance for the college of engineering? I heard it was really hard to get into and I'm wondering if it's worth it to try to apply for COE. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi there, I'm a 23 year old exchange student coming from New Zealand to study Fashion design for one semester. I am trying to decided between living in the Ecology house or the Just about Music house, and wondered if any of you could give me some advice. I love being outdoors and going on walks etc, but I am also a musician who would like to jam. I'm looking for a house that has a good social scene as I want to make new friends. I am wondering if anyone has any experience living in either of these houses and can shed some light. From what I've read the Ecology house seems to be less social then other houses and I do not know much about the JAM house apart from its facilities but from the photos I've found it doesn't look very 'busy'. As a person who is neither a great musician nor someone studying nature I am scared that I'll be living in one house where I feel inadequate and do not share their interests to the same extent as most others do. Do many people choose a themed house outside of their Degree interests? Any info/experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance :) <eos> \n",

I was looking through and they are sizably different in price (I'm most likely to live in North Campus with the rest of the freshman if that helps) 2. What is the best way to get around campus (especially during the thick of the winter)? I'm from down south so I'm used to walking around a lot. Is there a free bus system or something of the sort on campus?  3. I'm a southerner with absolutely 0 experience when it comes to cold weather. What are the essentials (i.e. are winter boots, scarves, beanies, gloves, etc. must-haves?)? Any other tips?  Thanks so much!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> How common are external transfers to the College of Engineering? Cornell seems to be transfer-friendly, but I’m not sure how selective engineering is relative to other schools. Are any external transfers to engineering on this subreddit? For reference, I’m currently a freshman at Duke Engineering and applying for Fall 2018 admission. I’m really interested in the Operations Research/Information Engineering major, and despite being a great school Duke doesn’t offer a comparable program.  <eos> \n",

But under the heavy workload of ChemE, I may not be able to take CS 3410. Is it possible to do CS 4410 without taking CS 3410? Can I just pick up whatever I need to know to take CS 4410 by myself?

            "<bos> If we need to run some application on a computing lab computer, which will generate a file, can we run it directly under a directory of an online storage, so that the output file will be automatically generated in our online storage account?  This way, there is no need to copy and paste from the computer to our online storage account or flash drive, and maybe we can also run away instead of waiting for the program to finish, since we know we will have our result in our online storage.

I don't have any friends who have taken 2700, so I'm trying to figure out what kind of class it is. I took basic high school stats and found that okay, and I do have a background in lin alg which would probably make 2940 the easier option, but I'm very interested in the possibility of a stats minor, and would like to know more about this class/how hard it is. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello again! as a prospective gov major there's only one of the two required introductory courses offered at the moment that I can make, GOV 1817, which I read can be tough (although theres a new prof this year I've also read that her past courses were rough). I'm debating trying to finesse my way into AMST 2225 contraversies about inequality, which is currently full, bc I need to finish with a good gpa so I can transfer out of cornell (personal reasons). I've emailed the gov department and the prof about AMST 2225 but I want to know if it's worth it. I'd rather take 2225 if its easier and it def seems more interesting to me. I also think they both fufill gov major requirements. <eos> \n",

We're building an epic college book tour for my book, [Without Their Permission]([url link] but a couple of schools haven't been as responsive as we'd hoped, so I'm turning to the school's subreddit for some help.

So it looks like I can use AP credits for some classes, but when I went to visit Cornell and talked with students there they said the credits didn't count towards any sort of freshman requirements. So I just wanted to know for sure if I could use, say, a 4/5 on AB calculus to skip out of a math requirement or something.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I got accepted into one project team but I was also thinking of applying to a few others. However, I don't think I will have time to be accepted/rejected from the other project teams I'm interested in before I have to accept/decline my existing offer. Should I just take the offer even if I'm unsure about this project team now? Also does anyone see any difference between project teams directed at competition and those not strictly directed towards them(workload, competitiveness, team atmosphere)? I'm an ECE freshman as well if that helps to answer any of my questions.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey there! I'm looking into Cornell's engineering program and I have a few questions about the Sibley school, looking at it as someone who would major in Aerospace, were it offered. Without further ado, my questions: 1. How much of a focus do you feel like it really is? In the sense that do you feel like you're learning to be an aerospace engineer, or a mechanical engineer who has some aerospace knowledge? 2. How well do you feel like the school is connected, in terms of your ability to find internships or other work opportunities within the industry?  I'm looking to work on spacecraft propulsion systems, if that helps at all. Thanks a million!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was born and raised in Central Florida - the kind of place where people will literally break out their parkas if the weather dips below 60 degrees. Cold weather isn't completely foreign to me - I've seen snow on vacations and gone skiing in the Carolinas - but I've never lived in a place where I couldn't wear t-shirts and shorts 95% of the time. In the past, going up north has involved layering every lightweight cotton sweater I own and trying to avoid being outside as much as possible. Such a strategy may've worked for a week or two vacation, but I'm afraid it'll be a long four years if I don't invest in some real winter gear. So, Cornellians of Reddit, what's the secret to thriving in the cold? I'm a guy more concerned with function than form, trying to stay toasty warm without adding too much bulk to my already bulky frame. lol PS. My grandfather gave me a heavyweight down coat when he heard I'd be heading to Ithaca, but aside from a few hoodies and sweatpants, I've got nothing. Thank you all for your help! -B Edit: Would I run into any problems having amazon packages shipped to my dorm room after move-in? <eos> \n",

I searched the course catalog and it seems like Cornell used to offer classes up to the 3000 level until the 2015-2016 school year, and has disappeared since. I'm Cantonese by heritage but can hardly hold a half-conversation and would love to learn the language! I guess I could learn Mandarin instead but I'd be less driven to study it (I'll be attending CoE, so I don't think language is a requirement). Thanks a bunch! [url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Reflecting on freshman year, I'm realizing I’m doing pretty bad in CS and Cornell in general. I got a low B in python, a C+ in 1910, a mid C in 2110 (even took an AEW, got Cs on both prelims and over average on most projects), and got a C+ on the last 1920 prelim (hopefully will end up around B- after the final). I’m really worried about the future because I’m barely passing the affiliation reqs. Especially since I feel like I study/work so much I barely have time for other hobbies and I just feel worse seeing other people enjoy social life/hobbies and doing average or better in the same courses. I’ll be taking courses like 3110 and 2800 next semester and reading through this subreddit and hearing the TAs talk about these courses makes me scared. Thing is, I really enjoy CS currently and I’m learning Android dev too because it is so awesome to me and I’ve always wanted to get into it. Any tips for the future? I’m thinking about reading up on 2800 stuff in the summer because I need to get a 2.5+ in 2800+2110 and I don’t wanna risk anything. Is this a good idea? Should I even continue with CS classes next semester if I'm having so much trouble?  <eos> \n",

I've been looking at the website and something about it confuses me. It says you can only get credit for CS 2800 OR INFO 2950 for info sci majors, which I'm not, but I'm wondering if there's a lot of overlap since I was planning to take 2800 anyway. Neither are strict requirements, so if I could get recommendations or learn about other data science classes you guys have taken I'd really appreciate it! thanks <eos> \n",

Joined one in freshman year but ended up not liking it I'm interested in joining an a capella, and I also really want to join yamatai since their concert is so lit. I also want to check out some project teams as an engineering student. I'm very concerned that they are not happy to take juniors since you only have 2 yrs left. Also I guess when people ask me it's embarassing to tell people you are a junior ...Idk  <eos> \n",

Was it easy to throw the party and where did you have it (lounge/floor/dorm room)? In another case, is it easy environment to make friends? I'm really social (wanted Donlon, but you can't get everything!) and want to make sure that my dorm is lit :P  Also, a bunch of us are thinking of having a door decorating contest..is that even allowed? Plus, is it possible to decorate the floor hallways (using posters, christmas lighting..etc)? If so, are there any power outlets running along the hallways?  <eos> \n",

My school is super Catholic, and we have no frats anywhere nearby. When I get to Cornell, one of the things I'm most excited about is rushing a frat. My dad, who went to Dartmouth, told me that the highlight of his college years was being a fraternity brother. However, after scrolling through a few posts on this thread, and looking on CC, I found out that Cornell fraternities aren't too friendly to sophomore transfers. I read that fraternities most frats recruit during the spring of freshman year, which is obviously a non-starter for me. So, in essence, I wanted to ask if a transfer student like me can rush a frat at Cornell, and if so, how? <eos> \n",

FWS ROMS1102 - 6 books ~ $80 Total ~ $500  This are all used book prices and I know that some classes the books are optional and the FWS probably wont assign all 6 but it seems like a lot in total.

            "<bos> I'm a student at another college at Cornell for the summer to do research (REU). I've been to places like CTB, but I was wondering, does anyone know if the Cornell summer dining hours are available? It seems like a lot of places close at 2 (so just for lunch), are there any places open for dinner or do you just venture to College Avenue? I live at West Campus so I was wondering what summer hours might be for places like Jansen's Market or Noyes Community Recreation Center and was just wondering if anyone knew.  edit: Never mind haha, I searched around and found it.. for anyone else who is interested (unfortunately looks like almost everything is closed): [url link] I guess to use the Community Rec Center you need a membership pass? Also, anyone know what the social scene is like for those who aren't 21 yet? I'm a bit bummed because I have a few months before I turn 21 and it seems like the bar scene is pretty big here haha.  <eos> \n",

Please share your thoughts so we may try and get this ball rolling!  EDIT: We are thinking the weekend following the first week of classes! Friday or Saturday?

            "<bos> Three months ago, I pre-paid for two tickets on December 24th for this new-and-slightly-cheaper-than-C2C bus service. Today, Big Red Bullet joins the ranks of the \"bollocks to our customers, we'll just cancel the service we sold 'em a while ago\" travel businesses:  \"The management team of the Big Red Bullet has been looking at the schedule for the holiday period, particularly since both Ithaca College and Cornell are both on prolonged breaks. Since they are our main source of customers, we have decided not to operate for the period 24 December until 2 January, inclusive.  We regret that you have already made a reservation during that time frame and we regret any inconvenience this may cause. Both Greyhound and Shortline will continue to operate a full schedule between New York and Ithaca. You will, of course, receive a full reimbursement for the booking you have made.\"  So, yeah -- to fuckery with Big Red Bullet.  <eos> \n",

Unfortunately because of family issues and mental health I did very poorly on all of my classes and my GPA dropped to a 2.4...it may even drop lower since not all grades are posted. I'm just in a really bad place right now and I wanted to get opinions on taking a semester off or any other options I may have. I really don't want to transfer because I love this school.

            "<bos> I applied to Cornell for CS-Eng transfer and will hear back any time between next week and June. So my question is, coming from Georgia Tech, whose campus is situated in the heart of Atlanta, is transferring worth it? With many classes possibly not transferring, and having to readjust, I'm having second thoughts. Also, what can you tell me about the level of difficulty relative to GT? Will it be significantly harder? Just in case anyone's wondering ,one of the main reasons I want to transfer is because it's been my dream to work in NYC, and I feel a degree from Georgia Tech won't put me in an advantageous of a position as one from Cornell would. Does that thought hold true? Sorry for the rambling. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> UPDATE: These calls are legitimate. I just got off the phone with the Bursar's office. The person working there had never heard of ERS, but after checking with others, it turns out that this company was hired by Cornell to distribute information to students. The person I spoke to just happened to be really unprofessional. Why this couldn't have been done via e-mail, I do not know.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I got a call from a company called ERS, claiming to be a \"business partner\" of Cornell handling financial aid. They knew my full name, cell number and the fact that I was a student, so I didn't hang up immediately. When I started asking questions about why I had to do anything at all (I'm on a fellowship) and why Cornell wasn't contacting me directly, I got vague answers. When I pressed further, they hung up. I suspect it was a phishing attempt, and I'm probably not the first student they've called. Has anyone else gotten a similar call?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi all, I am a second semester, external-transfer sophomore doing ISST in Engineering, but, after securing a summer role and getting involved in some projects, my interest in CS is growing. I was interested in transferring to AS to study as a Computer Science major.  I had a question about this stipulation [from the artssciences website]([url link]  Because of the College’s four-semester residency requirement, if you externally transfer into Cornell as a second-semester sophomore or later, you won't be eligible for internal transfer into Arts  Sciences. Now, if I stay an extra semester, would I meet this residency requirement? Or rather, is it a blunt, explicit rule?  Some have suggested to do CS in engineering, but, that is not of my interest.  Thanks.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, all I'm interested in learning more about graduate life at Cornell University for those who chose to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research. Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don't take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Cornell give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much \"catching up\" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for Cornell? Thank you so much for your input. =) PS.: A few weeks ago I posted this same message on the Biweekly sub, but I got no answers. Probably, there were not a lot of graduate students there. So one of the moderators said I could post it here. <eos> \n",

The snow is already going to make it difficult to get to class, I don't want frequent protests doing that as well.

Im leaning towards CALS because I heard that the communications program is relatively easy and afterwards I can salvage my attempts at Yale Med school or Yale Law school, whatever field I choose to pursuit. Is there any truth to that or should I go to Northwestern and major in Political Science, which I love. I'm so confused, would appreciate your insights P.S. I'm from SF, not NY, so the cost is roughly the same (slightly cheaper for NU). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am currently an undeclared sophomore (AS) so you can probably see why I'm stressing out. Initially (in HS) I thought I'd be studying physics in college. Later on, when I first came to school I thought maybe math and/or econ. Then I took some gov classes and enjoyed writing a few papers. My interests are always changing to the point I'm not sure if I like everything or nothing. At this point, I could easily complete a double major gov/econ (and I want to do a double since I can't narrow down to one). At the same time, I've become really interested in linguistics while also thinking maybe I should go back to my initial interest in math. You can see I'm all over the place. I've met with my academic advisor/career services and the meetings do help but after I leave and am left to my own devices I'm back to indecisiveness. Basically I was wondering: 1) How did you know what you wanted to major in? Were you totally passionate about it (like all these people seem) or just figured it's good enough? 2) Also, for people that majored in something and ended up going to grad school or working in a field not fully related to their major, what was your experience like? My biggest fear is limiting myself in my major and discovering later on I don't enjoy what I'm doing as much as I thought but being unable to switch my path. I've talked to some people (professors etc.) that went to grad school for something completely unrelated to their undergrad and it gives me hope that your major isn't your future written in stone, but it still worries me. Sorry for the long post, thanks to anyone that responds! <eos> \n",

Can help meet friends, romantic interests, etc. Maybe specify what you're looking for. I mean I see a bunch of threads asking how to meet people here, and we all to Cornell, so why not? Just thought to make a thread to see any interest and if yes or no, we can go from there. EDIT: Alright, so I have decided that I will make the thread. Actually, I will make two. One for meeting individual friends (a lot better for people uncomfortable meeting a giant group of strangers from online, and one for an actual meet-up (will do a bit later, maybe next weekend, because of logistics such as where to meet, when, what to do, what to bring if anything, etc). *Side note but if anybody has an idea on any of the stuff mentioned or just wants to be the organizer of the second one, just PM me and we can talk about it* <eos> \n",

It's been 4 years since I've taken undergraduate math courses, with calculus 1 + 2 being my only required math courses back then.

The AEM program really draws me as I've always loved Science and wouldn't mind continuing to learn about it while focusing on business. Anyways, transferring from a Canadian Uni. in Halifax, Nova Scotia although I'm originally from Toronto.  // Current Courses Info \\\\  My courses this semester (current marks in brackets):  Microeconomics (4.0), Quantitative Methods I (4.3), Business Management (4.3), US History 1865-Present (4.3), English (3.7) -- GPA 4.0/4.3 or 3.94 on Canadian 4.0 scale (85%+ = A+)  Next semester - currently registered: Macroeconomics, Quantitative Methods II, Social Psychology, Computer Science, Calculus and 2nd year US History. Although, with desire to fulfill prerequisites (upon your advice), I am considering registering in Biology, Writing (at another university) and Chem or Physics.   A few questions (mostly based on AEM transfer info on Cornell site)  1) I see that a prerequisite is two writing/English courses. My school only offers one, should I take one at the other university in my city (Dalhousie)? If I don't will it void my application?  2) In terms of the recommended courses, do most successful transfers have all of these courses? I'm going to register in a few of them next semester, but it is too late to take the full-year biology course. Would my application suffer greatly if I am missing 1 or 2 of them? Which courses that I am registered in 2nd semester provide the least benefit to my application (the ones I should drop to add bio/public speaking?  3) What weight do high school marks play a role in admissions?  4) Average GPA of AEM transfer?

However ever since attending both the BEE experience with the “wonderful” Dr Hunter and the ENGRI for Biological engineeeing, my view of the department has now deteriorated to an unorganized disaster. Also when I talked with multiple BE seniors, all of them literally said they wished they were a different major (from BME to Meche).

I can't really judge how much I will need per month at college.  Is 600 USD per month enough for a student at college? This excludes dorm fee and meal plan. I will have a one meal per day meal plan (cheapest and most convenient plan). Therefore, I will spend some for other meals everyday.  I don't party or take alcohol. Expenses might only be for meals, textbooks and college activities. It's highly unlikely that I will spend much on entertainment.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I'm currently a freshman at a large state university interested in transferring to Cornell. I'm doing well at my school (3.9 GPA, some clubs, and lab research/volunteer/assistant type gig, etc.), but my school doesn't offer the major I'm interested in, classes related to that major, nor are there faculty members at my school who're working on research in my major/field of interest. I'm interested in transferring to CALS (they have the major I'm looking for, and Cornell has classes/faculty pertaining to such interests).  My main question is about spring and fall transfers. I can't apply for a sophomore fall transfer, i.e. within a month, but I'm willing to go for a spring transfer during my sophomore year. I wanted to know if there was any difference in transferring during the spring of sophomore year versus fall junior year. Is it more difficult? Or is it just more/less time spent at Cornell? Any other advice on the transfer process would be greatly appreciated.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys so I'm currently enrolled in CS 1110 (Intro to Python) but I'm thinking of changing it up during the add/drop period. I'm a decently experienced programmer who understands the foundations of coding/software development but I'm also super rusty. I took AP CS my junior year of Highschool and did really well but I blew off the AP test and got a 4 (can't place out of 1110 without a 5). I've also just coded on the side for fun (2 years ago). I really haven't coded since then. I'm wondering if I should take the CS placement exam tomorrow afternoon (which would require me to brush up on my Java) and try to get into the 2000 level course, or just stick with 1110? Any advice on the difficulty of the placement exam, the courses themselves, or the impact of course choice on jobs/internships would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. <eos> \n",

I plan on following the pre-med route and I know Cornell doesn't have a pre-med program. A lot of people tell me to go for Bio since they think Organic Chem will be hell.

How was the professors? 2) Will there be a tremendous difference of classes between the two majors? Since I'll be filling up requirements for med school either way, would I be taking similar classes?

I'm wondering if there are any groups on campus that would get together to play some rock/alternative music (I happen to like those the most). I think that would be very fun, and would help me learn faster.  Also, I'm trying to get a guitar. I've asked some people, and many say that I should be expecting to spend between $2-300.

I never considered applying to an Ivy league school until a friend mentioned it. I would be a Junior transfer student planning to major in Econ. I had a 1350 SAT score for Math/CR in high school. I did alright for most of high school until senior year. Due to my issues with senior year I decided to go to a cc first. I am currently a Business major with a 3.3 gpa which should go up this semester. I have been an active student life, volunteering and will be graduating a semester early with an associates. Frankly I am hesitant when it comes to applying to any four year schools because of my senior year of high school. I am afraid that because I only went to a cc for 1 and a half years they will take into account that year heavily. Also since I will not be attending any school during what should have been my 2nd spring semester, is there anything I should do to bulk up my application?

I frequently see other drivers yelling at people through car windows or screaming and pointing, or pedestrians stopping in the middle of the street because they don't like the way someone is driving (saw it happen to someone else and had it happen to me as well). I've driven through Boston and Connecticut a fair amount and there was less road rage there. Is it just a dislike of Cornell students being in Ithaca?

I've also kind of asked this before and the answers were good but it was less specific and since add/drop is coming around I'm going for it again.  I'm honestly not the best math student it's just a cool subject to me and I like a challenge so why not.  Anyway I'll be a junior and only just finished multi (yeah I know) so my question is: should I just steer clear of any type of honors courses and take math courses that would be less difficult and hopefully help build more skill?  I'm thinking I'd like to focus more on the Algebra track than analysis so maybe it would make sense to do the following this semester: 3110 (non-honors analysis for the track) 3320 (number theory) 3040 (prove it)  And use spring to take care of the rest of analysis track plus an algebra course. The 3040 course would be to get a better understanding on proofs, number theory the professor said could help with the same (plus it's interesting) and I was told 3110 is good and not too heavy. Then use senior year to take honors linear algebra track mixed with other courses? Or would it be too late to take honors lin alg my senior year?  The OTHER probably not so smart option would be the following:  Take an honors track this year (either alg. or analysis) with one other math course each semester (since I'm sure that's all I'd be able to handle). If I did that should I use Prove It as my second math course to reinforce my use of proofs? (Also I'm sure it's probably a really bad idea to take an honors course without a good understanding of proofs I'm just kinda running out of time so it's stressing me out and I don't wanna avoid them altogether).

Do you think it would be a good idea to take CS 2800 concurrently with CS 1100? Or is it too much for a freshman? Apart from that I plan on taking MATH 1910, a FWS, and a PE.

So I'm a senior in high school and I have completed my Cornell CAS application, but I have some questions: 1. How is the neurobiology program at Cornell? I did research in neurobiology this summer and I'd love to continue and possibly major in Neuroscience/Neurobiology (can't remember what the exact title I selected was) so any insight would be appreciated! 2. How bad is the snow really? I'm from Maine, would I be able to handle it? Does it get really depressing during the winter? 3. I'm a girl and I'm on the fence about rushing a sorority.

So turns out I did pretty bad on some subjects on my IB exam, which makes me unable to receive credits for some intro courses. I plan to take the placement exams to try to get the credits, but in this case, I suppose I have to sign up for the introductory courses during course enrollment?  This means I'll have to use my credits (if I earn them) during the add/drop period, which starts one day after the placement exams.

If I were to learn OCaml on my own before taking the course, would that make it significantly easier? Would it still be super time-consuming?

I am in my junior year at a smaller state school in Illinois and am starting to look at graduate programs to continue with education instead of jumping into industry. I haven't decided on which path I would like to take yet, but I'd like to know if you think I even have a chance at getting into Cornell's CS program.

I have a lot of academic interests/passions and I\\'m trying to prioritize them before the next pre-enroll period. I went through the list of minors that Cornell has to offer and was left with three that interested me most: Info Sci, Linguistics, and the Dyson Business Minor for Engineers. This might sound crazy, but I want to minor in all three. I\\'m willing to put in the work, and with careful planning I think that it actually won\\'t be as much work as it sounds.  Am I allowed to use my major-required elective courses to \"double-count\" for minors?  For example, I want to take CS 4740 and CS 4744 as part of my CS electives. These courses are cross-listed as LING 4474 and LING 4424 respectively, and are acceptable classes to count towards the linguistics minor. LING 4424 is even allowed for the Info Sci minor--is it ok to use one course to fulfill a major requirement and two minor requirements all at once? Another question I have is: are minors even \"useful\"? I\\'m using them primarily as a way to organize my interests into groups of courses that are deemed related enough by Cornell to be called a minor. But what will employers think if they look at my future resume and see CS Major and triple minor? I want it to reflect my academic passions but am worried it will make it look as if I gamed the system (which I guess I kind of am). Also just for fun, what are your majors / minors? What drives your passions? Personally, I love CS because I view it as a nice mix between science and art.

Around a month ago (and every week after), we all would set aside project goals and agree on who was doing who. When these goals were rather easy (write up an idea for the project, write up what you'll do), all 4 of us contributed. Now though, in the last two weeks of the project, three of us have been meeting our goals while the fourth hasn't taken the time to update us on his progress. As it's really too late to turn back now, we see this partner will have had little contribution to the project overall. Does this look bad to graders, and would it be better to just attribute some work to him or to be honest and just lay out the facts? If this were something little, I wouldn't mind just attributing the work to him.

My fiancé and myself are looking to open up a business and we are wondering if Ithaca would be a good town to open up shop! The questions are Do you go to a coffee shop off campus? If there was a new coffee shop in town would you try it out? Do you play any trading card games, board games or video games on a regular basis? If there was a coffee shop that also routinely held various game nights and competitions would you frequent the establishment? Thanks for your time - I really appreciate any answers I get!

I visited Cornell a few years ago for a conference (what a pretty campus you have!) and bought a hoodie as a memento. I was wearing said hoodie recently around my campus back home. A guy in his 20s stopped me and introduced himself as a Cornell student visiting my school, and asked if I also attend to Cornell. When I told him that I did not, he seemed very confused and asked me pretty aggressively why I was wearing the crest of a school I haven't attended. I told him that I visited for a school event and he continued to press me about why I would wear another school's colors... I was pretty taken aback and walked away.  I was just wondering if there are unofficial rules-of-thumb about people wearing Cornell gear without attending, or if I just ran into someone in a bad mood.

Next year, we need to turn things around and restore Dragon Day to it's former glory. How do we do this, you ask? 1. Better day. The day before Spring Break, half of campus has already headed back to Westchester and Long Island. Terrible choice of day for a campus holiday.  2. Darties. Drunk kids are important for hyping up things that are typically boring, like sports. They would be great for the parade.  3. More engineering involvement. A gang of red-painted students should be roaming and annoying campus like the Archies. Plenty of strange engineering kids would love to do this. Dear god that Phoenix was depressing. We can do better. This would be a fun project for ENGRI classes to work on to make friends first semester and get some group project experience.  4. Bring back the F I R E.

There\\'s general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here! **Housing FAQ** * ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?*** I\\'ll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low.  * ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?*** Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option.  * ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?***  Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don\\'t find anything you like there, Googling \"Cornell Apartments\" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.   <eos> ', \"<bos> Last year there was news that Trevor Noah would be coming in September, but I haven't been able to find anything recent related to the event.

So background info, I was admitted to Cornell for Electrical and Computer Engineering as a freshman. I started off with a very difficult semester and begin to become less and less motivated in terms of what I was studying. To be completely honest, I much more enjoyed taking liberal arts courses in high school then STEM courses. Another thing that decreased my interest in engineering was my acceptance into a project team. Project teams provide students with a real life application and experience in terms of engineering, and I started to notice that compared to the other members who were extremely passionate with their roles, I started to heavily hate the fact that I just wasn't as passionate and wasn't having any fun. I felt like even though I got into a very top project team, it felt more of a burden then fun. One thing that I did seem to grow more interest was in the business subteams. For some reason, what they were doing actually seemed fun to me, and I started to grow more and more interested in business. Rightly so, I started to consider to transfer to AEM or the Hotel School. However, I had no experience in High School with business, and transferring to AEM or the Hotel School is extremely difficult. My next option was considering switching to Arts for Economics, but I'm not sure if majoring in economics will exactly be what I want to do. I feel constricted by the engineering curriculum and dislike the fact that I most likely won't find what I legitimately want to study at all. I considered majoring in OR, which at the moment, somewhat interests me, but I feel like it interests the most out of the other engineering majors because it is the closest to business. I am working to do as best possible as I can in my classes this semester to obtain the highest possible GPA. But I atleast want to start planning for next semester soon so that I can make a smooth transition to whatever I ultimately decide.

How do I get an internship? How can I improve my grade?” These are all fucking words we’ve made up for ourselves! All fucking made up bullshit manifestations of our own inadequacy.

For GOV I have 5's on Comp and US Gov. so I dont need to take the intro classes but I was wondering how difficult the 3000 level courses in Gov are. Maybe I should wait til second semester to take one of those. For Phil i was thinking of taking intro to PHIL but i heard that most people who major in phil dont actually take that and skip right to a 2000 level class. If so what do you guys recommend at that level for first semester. Lastly I had a question about requirements. The one thing I hate about CAS is the language requirement.

I've been really depressed at Cornell. No friends, no nothing. I've been going to Cornell Health which helped somewhat (I mean, my social situation hasn't really improved). I thought I'd meet most of my friends through clubs, but I was pretty much rejected from all the clubs that I had applied to.  I am trying ridiculously hard to get out of this shitty mental state. I tried saying hi, smiling to pretty much every single person in my class (I'm not going to complain actually--I gained a few acquaintances but no real friends).  Last fall term, I spent every single fucking day counting down the days left until the end of the semester. It was fucking painful for me.

I joined clubs that I\\'m interested in, I talked to people during orientation, but nothing really panned out and now I feel like everyone has settled into a routine and isn\\'t actively looking for new friends. I know that I have a lot of underlying social anxiety/self esteem issues that are holding me back, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to get through that. Therapy was something my parents wanted me to look into when I was having similar problems at my old school, so I called Cornell Health counseling last week, but they told me it would be over a month before I could make an appointment.

I'm coming in with Macro/Micro/One FWS/Stat done, as well as my western intellectual tradition, Science and Technology, and Cultural Perspectives credit.  Based on this: [url link] It seems like I only need 40 Credits in ILR Electives, and a couple more required classes, which should total 63 credits or so. But if I have two years (15 a semester=60 for the year) I should be able to squeeze it all in with two years correct? I'm trying to see if there's something i'm missing, or if there's a reason more ILR students don't graduate in three years. Graduating early would be a huge burden lifted financially for my family, so if this is possible I 100% want to do it.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Hey all.

Now to get into it, I'm not sure what course to take next semester. On the one hand, it's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that you should take Honors Analysis if you're considering grad school which I think I'd do if I did math (again, I swear I know I'm late hahaha). On the other hand, I'm not all that comfortable with proofs so I don't want to go into the class and then drown in unpreparedness. Still, doing Non honors intro analysis prevents you from being able to move into the next honors analysis class which would suck.  Wondering if anyone has advice as for where to go from here. Are there perhaps books you think are good on math proofs that I could read over the summer and prepare myself for writing more rigorous proofs? On the complete other hand, I don't think I'm much of a fan of the analysis side of math and think I'd prefer the algebra side. That said, I'm not sure of whether or not to take the analysis track first or the algebra track. Of course, it would be nice to take both concurrently but there's essentially zero chance of me being able to take both an honors analysis AND honors algebra with my current level of mathematical prowess. Perhaps I should take one honors next semester and one non-honors? The main problem is I'm running out of time, but if I'm considering grad school I'd like to take as many math courses as I can in the next two years.

Right now, I'm a freshman majoring in physics at a top 50-60 USNEWS school. I’d like to major in Chemical Engineering (my current school does not offer the major).

The reason I am worried is that I want to go into finance (IBanking), and although Cornell is a target school for this (as apposed to a semi target for my former school), I didn't know how little the curriculum was targeting finance.

My plan is to major in ILR and get minors in Business and Econ. But because of my new found stress I have been looking around and I realized that in order to go from a minor in Econ to a Major I only need to take three more classes.  I am thinking of now double majoring in ILR and Econ or switching into Econ itself and just using all my electives in finance/econ classes.

My GF might be attending Cornell for grad school in the Fall, and so we are starting a preliminary look at housing options.

The AS and theoretical math sequences require linear algebra before multivariable calculus. While this may be pedagogically nice, it is a bit out of sequence as the Physics EM (e.g. Phys 2170) will make heavy use of multivariable calculus right off the bat.

I did shitty on my first prelim season but I feel like that was a combination of getting used to Cornell's back to back prelim season along with me not knowing what and how to study with two exams on the same day with a project due and then having an exam the day after in class and an exam at night. I just don't know what to do at this point other than figure out what to do next prelim season other than just study more and hoping for the fact that I can do better since the prelims are more spread out. The one thing I just don't know what to do about is BEE 2600, which is Principles of Biological Engineering. The class isn't hard but it honestly feels like I'm fighting myself and the the head TA on everything. The project we did for the class had errors with the numbers and units and was incomplete and unless you showed up to TA hours you wouldn't be able to figure out the project was impossible to do. The TAs didn't even know there were errors and couldn't get the information or directions from the Head TA who was supposed to be at office hours at that time. That pretty much forced me and my group to spend that day and the day after trying to figure out what we can and cannot do for the case study since no one knew how to actually do the case study. Then, there are the prelims for the class which we just got back from the Head TA, so even if I wanted to drop the class I can't, and this was the one thing I thought I did good on and was one of the easier exams I took and I found it I did poorly on it too. I don't even blame the professor or the class itself, I just feel like I'm blaming the Head TA for everything. I can't even distract myself on the weekends from all of this because I just feel like I don't have anything to do or anyone to hang out with.

I got a low B in python, a C+ in 1910, a mid C in 2110 (even took an AEW, got Cs on both prelims and over average on most projects), and got a C+ on the last 1920 prelim (hopefully will end up around B- after the final). I’m really worried about the future because I’m barely passing the affiliation reqs. Especially since I feel like I study/work so much I barely have time for other hobbies and I just feel worse seeing other people enjoy social life/hobbies and doing average or better in the same courses. I’ll be taking courses like 3110 and 2800 next semester and reading through this subreddit and hearing the TAs talk about these courses makes me scared. Thing is, I really enjoy CS currently and I’m learning Android dev too because it is so awesome to me and I’ve always wanted to get into it. Any tips for the future? I’m thinking about reading up on 2800 stuff in the summer because I need to get a 2.5+ in 2800+2110 and I don’t wanna risk anything. Is this a good idea?

My dad, who went to Dartmouth, told me that the highlight of his college years was being a fraternity brother.

Will it be significantly harder?

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don\\'t take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Cornell give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much \"catching up\" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for Cornell?

Initially (in HS) I thought I'd be studying physics in college. Later on, when I first came to school I thought maybe math and/or econ. Then I took some gov classes and enjoyed writing a few papers. My interests are always changing to the point I'm not sure if I like everything or nothing. At this point, I could easily complete a double major gov/econ (and I want to do a double since I can't narrow down to one). At the same time, I've become really interested in linguistics while also thinking maybe I should go back to my initial interest in math. You can see I'm all over the place. I've met with my academic advisor/career services and the meetings do help but after I leave and am left to my own devices I'm back to indecisiveness. Basically I was wondering: 1) How did you know what you wanted to major in? Were you totally passionate about it (like all these people seem) or just figured it's good enough? 2) Also, for people that majored in something and ended up going to grad school or working in a field not fully related to their major, what was your experience like? My biggest fear is limiting myself in my major and discovering later on I don't enjoy what I'm doing as much as I thought but being unable to switch my path.

I am currently trying to figure out how the parking pass for graduate students works, and if it would be worth it for me. I will be working in Weill Hall, and I have seen the page below, but am not sure what/where these parking lots are.  Also, is the lot oversold, so you could possibly not find a spot?

The AEM program really draws me as I've always loved Science and wouldn't mind continuing to learn about it while focusing on business. Anyways, transferring from a Canadian Uni. in Halifax, Nova Scotia although I'm originally from Toronto.  // Current Courses Info \\\\\\\\  My courses this semester (current marks in brackets):  Microeconomics (4.0), Quantitative Methods I (4.3), Business Management (4.3), US History 1865-Present (4.3), English (3.7) -- GPA 4.0/4.3 or 3.94 on Canadian 4.0 scale (85%+ = A+)  Next semester - currently registered: Macroeconomics, Quantitative Methods II, Social Psychology, Computer Science, Calculus and 2nd year US History. Although, with desire to fulfill prerequisites (upon your advice), I am considering registering in Biology, Writing (at another university) and Chem or Physics.   A few questions (mostly based on AEM transfer info on Cornell site)  1) I see that a prerequisite is two writing/English courses. My school only offers one, should I take one at the other university in my city (Dalhousie)? If I don't will it void my application?  2) In terms of the recommended courses, do most successful transfers have all of these courses? I'm going to register in a few of them next semester, but it is too late to take the full-year biology course. Would my application suffer greatly if I am missing 1 or 2 of them? Which courses that I am registered in 2nd semester provide the least benefit to my application (the ones I should drop to add bio/public speaking?  3) What weight do high school marks play a role in admissions?  4) Average GPA of AEM transfer?

However ever since attending both the BEE experience with the “wonderful” Dr Hunter and the ENGRI for Biological engineeeing, my view of the department has now deteriorated to an unorganized disaster.

But, I'm an incoming freshman and an international student. I can't really judge how much I will need per month at college.  Is 600 USD per month enough for a student at college?

I'm doing well at my school (3.9 GPA, some clubs, and lab research/volunteer/assistant type gig, etc.), but my school doesn't offer the major I'm interested in, classes related to that major, nor are there faculty members at my school who're working on research in my major/field of interest. I'm interested in transferring to CALS (they have the major I'm looking for, and Cornell has classes/faculty pertaining to such interests).  My main question is about spring and fall transfers. I can't apply for a sophomore fall transfer, i.e. within a month, but I'm willing to go for a spring transfer during my sophomore year. I wanted to know if there was any difference in transferring during the spring of sophomore year versus fall junior year. Is it more difficult? Or is it just more/less time spent at Cornell?

I'm a decently experienced programmer who understands the foundations of coding/software development but I'm also super rusty. I took AP CS my junior year of Highschool and did really well but I blew off the AP test and got a 4 (can't place out of 1110 without a 5). I've also just coded on the side for fun (2 years ago). I really haven't coded since then. I'm wondering if I should take the CS placement exam tomorrow afternoon (which would require me to brush up on my Java) and try to get into the 2000 level course, or just stick with 1110? Any advice on the difficulty of the placement exam, the courses themselves, or the impact of course choice on jobs/internships would be greatly appreciated.

Also compared to other Lin Alg classes Professor is Andy Borum if that makes a difference Thanks     I would say you should take it with a professor who is pretty knowledgeable in general relativity. If you are interested in applying a theory in the physics of relativity, it is a great course to take. I also see there are a ton of things you need to know about the theoretical principles of relativity, so I would recommend checking out the course. If you are interested in\n",

It’s much more applied and focuses less on proofs and theoretical things, instead mostly is about “can you carry out this process” Of course, I had a different prof so your experience will probably be different.  \n"
