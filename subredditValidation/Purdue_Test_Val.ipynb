My current intended major is Nuclear Engineering which has a 3.00 requirement for the 2016 pool(although last year's pool was a 2.00 and next year's is a 2.60). I know that they pull from below the 3.00 requirement if there have room, so what I'm asking is if I'm close enough with my GPA to take the risk or should I change my major? <eos> \n","<bos> Another lonely freshman here who really identified with the last person who posted this.

All my friends from high school have either been accepted to fall or are going to a different college. With that being said I have a roommate for the fall semester but am looking for one for the summer session. PSU's roommate selection seems to be \"diversity driven\" so you are randomly put with someone, but I would like to be with someone I know I will have a great time with.

I am good friends with one of the residents, however, today they decided to charge money and then later called the police to break it up, without offering a refund. I am looking for a very good place to day drink this summer. Preferably with a body of water and within walking distance of downtown, since we are planning to be intoxicated. If there is no water that is fine, but hopefully it'd have some good shade. If you have any ideas please respond. <eos> \n","<bos> If you are going to be a student in the fall, you can now make use of all of the benefits students get.

He is trying to buy a weekly parking pass for it online and there is no option for it even though I know it exists. We did it last year for a couple weeks. It would be pretty ridiculous to let you buy passes by the semester online but not by the week. Anyone know where I could buy one before the office opens tomorrow? Our only other option is to park it anyway and hope for the best.

Ex. Go through first week of classes, drop out second week. What's even the purpose in dropping out?

Preferably the IM building as I live right off the meridian and the White Loop takes me right there from my apartment. Really want to get involved in a new sport as I've never tried boxing before and it seems like great exercise. Also if anyone would happen to know where MMA might be offered anywhere in State College too, I'd appreciate being informed about it! Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm good friends with the kid in the blue band that got engaged at the game tonight.

I wanted to ask if anyone really knows what the MRC counselors do and what's your experience with them. I know they don't have control over things such as scheduling classes but I just really need some advice and support on how to continue in school. I feel like my own academic advisor is getting sick of this conversation because I'll already have to be here 5 years (I'm a transfer and that complicated things).

I've tried researching about the apartments- what they look like, how noisy they are, what the community life is like- to no avail.  I'm currently living in the dorms and it is absolute hell. I can't sleep at night, I wake up exhausted, the girls in my floor are ridiculously loud. I chose White Course because I wanted to live on-campus and it seemed like the calmest place (families, spread out buildings, nice lawn area), but I'm worried that it'll be a repeat of this year living in the dorms. I have a single room but I share the apartment with 3 other girls. Is living there comfortable? How thin are the walls?

I was recently diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and its been life changing. I was hoping to connect with some fellow T1Ders here at Penn state! Please let me know if you're out there!  <eos> \n","<bos> So I had a decent mental breakdown the other night after doing midterms, being sick, family stress, and medical complications, and after all of this missed a class where we had a physical copy of a paper due, no emails or canvas accepted. It happened right before class, and I even messaged the TA about it at 6:30 am. Can UHS or the psychological center help me out here, or are there any policies that put a students pre-existing medical conditions above a due date? I really don’t need my grade dropping 100 points because I broke down like this. I know even worse people faking it have probably made huge problems in this department, but I have the testimony of a nurse who was with me at the time of all this who can speak on my behalf. Am I safe to say I’m failing this class now? Or is this just the panic attack talking and I’ll be fine? <eos> \n","<bos> Freshman here. I kind of hate Angel with a burning passion.

I am planning on rushing in Spring 2018. I am a Junior transfer but I am graduating in 2020 (so I am technically a sophomore). I really want to join a fraternity but I am afraid that I might not get a bid because I have heard that the rush can be very competitive. Also, in my previous university, I rushed in fall 2016 and didn't get a bid from the houses I wanted to join. And, also, I went to the zone days in the fall semester, but I did not hear back from all the fraternities.  Is rush competitive at Penn State?

As a recent grad who was at Penn State for the fallout of the Football-Industrial Complex/Grand Experiment/Tarnished \"Old State\" I hope to occasionally hear about the evolving culture of the school. I suppose not much has changed; a compulsive longing for the way things used to be and a blinding obsession with the \"Football is Penn State\" mentality.  As this post relates to Onward State- come on! Your front page has nothing but up to the minute minutia about who is going to be the next celebrity head coach in town. I used to regard Onward State as a reputable and even ballsy news source for journalism that provided critical commentary and inquiry into what is going on at Penn State.  <eos> \n","<bos> Is it possible to take ECON 102 online?

I have a few people already, but I'm hoping to have 5-6 players who are actually interested and are wanting to play about every week for 3-5 hours. As far as players... if you are a beginner, great! I can send you some material to read and we'll be on our way. It will absolutely help you to actually read it if you've never played any kind of tabletop RPG before, because the interactions take some time getting used to. If you are not a beginner, here are some things I want you to keep in mind: 1. No min/maxing. Obviously you can try to make your character good, but the goal should not be to make a character that's stronger than everyone else's because you know more about the game. I'll probably use dice rolls for attributes. 2. No derailing, beyond what's reasonable. Be considerate of other people and what they want to do as the party. Obviously you can roleplay, but the majority of the session should not be taken up by you trying to come up with schemes that no one else wants to participate in. To enforce this, I'll generally just kill your character if you do anything stupid repetitively. 3. Be considerate. Obviously, people taking 5 minutes for turns isn't fun when you planned what you want to do three turns ago, but if someone is struggling, give them advice instead of getting impatient. <eos> \n","<bos> I can't wait to be a lion!

This is your opportunity to tell us something about yourself that is not already reflected in your application or academic records. We suggest a limit of 500 words or fewer. Because there are a lot of Penn State campuses, do I: * Not name-drop any features that would relate to my experiences or activities on any of the campuses and focus on intangible aspects like school spirit or generic aspects like research opportunities or, * Do I split it between the two campuses I am interested in and talk about how certain programs suit me.

GPA is one of the top priorities for Grad Schools and I have heard that PennState is known to have a low average because of the rigorous classes. I the admissions committee would take it into account, but would I have an advantage if I do it from another University where it is easier to get a higher GPA? So it is basically Reputation vs GPA.

I live near Philadelphia, so the drive was lengthy, but I enjoyed it when you start seeing he numerous rivers and mountains and wildlife. I took a trip to Penns cave , which I enjoyed a lot.

I heard today that an IST professor demoed Glass to their class today. I also heard that the professor was very clueless about Glass and spread myths such as how Glass is banned everywhere and how Glass you can just walk down the street and find out people's information. These statements are very, very false. If you were in the class I'm speaking about and the professor did in fact say these things, let me know.

I'm wondering if there are suburbs in the surrounding areas that are similar to state college? For example, I like the fact that I can walk to bars and restaurants like 4-5 blocks away but my apt is still really quiet (it also has a ton of houses surrounding it). And eventually I'd like to get a house. So my question is, is there a location within a half hours drive of Philly that basically has a really cool downtown area like we have with lots of bars and restauraunts, but you are able to buy a house within walking distance to it?  One option would be to live in south Philly and buy a townhouse but I'm not sure that option is for me. I'm more of a suburb person.  <eos> \n","<bos> A friend and I set out tonight with the hopes of doing some urban exploration of those tunnels we've all heard so much about.

I have an offer to work this fall/winter out of state, and really want to take up the opportunity. I'm confident I'll have enough time to take at least 12 credits while working (I usually have 1-2 jobs when at UP), but since this would most likely be a one semester opportunity, I want to make sure of a few things. * 1 -- If I transfer to World Campus and move out of state, then decide to move back to UP for spring semester, will my tuition then be out of state?  * 2 -- At least from what I've seen, the World Campus tuition for a full time student is cheaper than UP tuition (even in state). Does this end up being cheaper, or are there an abundance of hidden surcharges, etc that make up the difference? The price of $2.5k cheaper tuition seems too good to be true.  * 3 -- Since I have three years of UP classes done, the World Campus classes will contribute towards my total, correct? Obviously want to make sure of this.  Thanks! I emailed my advisor but want to get some other opinions as well.  <eos> \n","<bos> Just curious c: thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> Currently have 3 tickets to the Paul McCartney concert this Thursday, and unfortunately my plans fell through and the friends I was going with can no longer go.

Is there a sample test I can show him?  <eos> \n","<bos> I'm starting at Penn (World Campus) this semester, and am having a hard time deciding what I want to do credit wise. I'm considering loading up and taking 18 because of the way the campus' tuition structure works, but am hesitant because I don't know how intense the courses are going to be. I'm just doing freelance work from home right now and have a lot of time open, and I'm transferring from another school (where I also took my classes online full-time) so I'm not worried about the structure of the courses or anything. Still, 18 credits sounds like it could be a lot. Anyone have any thoughts on this? <eos> \n","<bos> I'm looking for the video they play at the start of the men's hockey games.

I'm now entering my 5th semester, and have not yet completed CMPSC 122. I attempted 122 during my 3rd semester and realized that I had forgotten almost everything that I'd learned in 121. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for from you guys, but I don't know what to do. -Should I audit 121? -Does anyone have 121 notes that I could review before attempting 122 again? -Does someone have the ability to tell me in the comments everything I need to remember from 121? -Maybe there is someone who would tutor me or show me what I need to know in the short amount of time we have before classes start back up?

I loved O'Brien as much as the next guy, but everyone needs to understand that Penn State has entered a staunchly different Post-Paterno era.  O'Brien was one of the best hires in college football two seasons ago, especially for the situation that Penn State was in. His recruiting helped PSU Football get back on its feet and get past the murkiness of 2011. I'm seeing a remarkable amount of negativity towards O'Brien: People saying he's not a true \"Penn Stater\" for leaving and that this is a selfish move that shows he wasn't the right man for the job. I can't agree with this logic. BoB was one of the best coaches in all of college football, so you're simply wrong if you ever thought that he'd stay here for an extended amount of time. Am I way off on this? I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on O'Brien's legacy at Penn State, if you're understanding of him leaving or just mad.  <eos> \n","<bos> Looking for people to watch races with.

Despite Beaver Stadium being packed once again--united--we couldn't establish a solid foothold into our program's new era. However, there was one moment which was genuinely heartfelt and magnificent--some may even say, *healing*. It occurred during the singing of our Alma Mater. Like many other universities, we rose from our seats, link arms, and sang our song before this football. But this time it was special. For those of you who don't know (hopefully none of you) these are the lyrics to \"Raise the Song\": \" For the glory of old State, For her founders strong and great, For the future that we wait, Raise the song, raise the song. / Sing our love and loyalty,  Sing our hopes that bright and free  Rest, O mother dear, with thee,  All with thee, all with thee. / When we stood at childhood's gate, Shapeless in the hands of fate, Thou didst mold us, dear old State, Dear old State, dear old State. / **May no act of ours bring shame,** To one heart that loves thy name. May our lives but swell thy fame, Dear old State, dear old State. \" Not that 90,000 of us chanting our Alma Mater is quiet by any stretch of the imagination, but during the singing of the emboldened line \"May no act of ours bring shame,\" we truly gave it our all. Here we were, at the moment the 3rd largest city in PA, gathered in unison, not singing, but proudly declaring (yelling, really) our misstep and our now-prerogative.  It was bellowing. It was magnificent. And once the game was over, and our players were walking off the field solemn and heartbroken, we gathered and sang it again.  I share this with you because the description \"proud\" simply doesn't suffice. It was a defining moment of our university, and hardly any non-Penn Staters experienced it. It was a reminder that we are more than what happened to us this past year. We are a gigantic but great crowd of individuals who really contribute something to this world. We are. <eos> \n","<bos> I was just curious as to whether or not I could get into Penn State for chemical engineering. I'm currently a junior in high school and really need some guidance.

We were surprised because everyone in our neighborhood and at her school (Philly exerbs) HATES Penn State. They refer to it as a cult and say that people who went there are awful. Last night a couple of friends told my wife that they would not send their kids there if it was free-- \"anywhere but Penn State\". They were like this even before the Sandusky business and have been talking for years about how they hope the scandal will destroy the school. I come from the Midwest, where passionate college fans are pretty common, so Penn State does not seem that unusual/awful to me. What is wrong with people who love their school well after college? We have not heard any rationale explanation for what I started calling Nittanyphobia-- Fear of Penn State.  Does anyone here have insight about the hatred in Philly about Penn State? Why do people in Philly hate the school so much? Is there a reason that I should be worried about sending my daughter to a \"blue and white cult\"?

It's a minor within the College of IST, and they're very strict about prerequisites. I have plenty of room in my schedule- it's not that. I could very easily fit 12+ IST courses before my normal graduation date but I hadn't picked this minor until fall of my sophomore year and my planning with my adviser didn't show any problems until this semester.. (study abroad and work experience have complicated things) I'd spoken with undergrad advising at IST semi-frequently and they were very adamant that there are no exceptions to the order in which they make you take the courses. No taking prereqs concurrently, no taking courses out of order, etc.  Anyway, I'm a techie that was enjoying supplementing my major with this minor, but I'm not clear whether I want to push back my graduation to take a single IST course.  edit: would probably be able to pick up a second minor in a foreign language if I postpone, as well, though I don't know whether even that justifies the cost <eos> \n","<bos> I'm a student from NYC who will be going to University Park soon.

None of them seemed to mind. I got to one stand, of 3d art (remaining vague on purpose). As I was taking pictures the artist herself came up to me and **shoved my camera away**, saying that I couldn't take pictures. Needless to say, it left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a fingerprint on my lens. I looked on the website and there's nothing that bans photography there. If anything, it helps an artist gain recognition... so I'm guessing this is just a per-artist decision and it's okay for me to continue taking pictures? <eos> \n","<bos> Can anyone provide their own pictures of a traditional double in west, Hamilton Hall?

I've gotten a few messages from people who are looking forward to tomorrow! I know I am! Here are the final details: * **What:** PSU Grad Student meetup! * **Where:** ZBar (113 Heister St in Downtown State College, PA). Same building as Saloon/Deli, across the street from Chipotle. * **When:** Friday, 10/17. 10 PM - Whenever we go home * **Why:** To give grad students a chance to meet other grad students outside of their department/lab, and hopefully make a few new friends! If this gets enough people, it can hopefully be a recurring thing. * **Who:** Any grad student at PSU (Masters, Ph.D, M.D, J.D, etc) who is friendly and willing to meet new people is welcome to attend! This offer also extends to our combined undergrad/masters students! * **How we will meet up:** I will be waiting at the corner of ZBar furthest from College Ave on Heister a bit before 10 PM. I am a male with brown hair, and will be wearing a black button down shirt. I will do my best to make sure I don't accidentally get stuck in a crowd so that I'm visible. Once a few people show up, we'll go inside. Alternately, you can shoot me a PM with your number, I'll send you mine, and you can text me if you are having trouble finding us. We will most likely be at ZBar the whole time, so we should still be there even if you come after 10. If you arrive after we're already inside, come in and look around. I'll do my best to keep an eye out for anyone who seems \"lost\". Also, **even though we're meeting at a bar, drinking is not a requirement.** So, please feel free to come even if alcohol isn't your thing!  Finally, while the point of this isn't for everyone to just get hammered, there will obviously be alcohol. Please know how you're going to get home if you do plan to have more than a few. **Designated Drivers are welcome to attend regardless of if they are in grad school or not!** I hope to see you there! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm in desperate need of taking over someone's lease for Fall '13.

We'll be meeting at 7pm in the HUB, this Saturday (29th), and we'll meet by the fish tanks. It's an open invite to all PSU redditors (and friends if they have nothing else to do)! Hopefully we can get more people to come since there isn't a home game this weekend!  Everyone is welcome to bring any board games or card games they think people would want to play. Right now we have a couple different Munchkin card games, the game of things, settlers of catan, and someone's bringing their magic cards (so if you have them and want to play, bring them!). There was also some talk about apples to apples and cards against humanity, but I'm not entirely sure if someone is going to bring it. So if anyone has them and wants to bring them that would be great! Snacks are welcome, but not necessary. Last time we ended up meeting for a while and then went to get Chipotle, so that's an option for food if anyone gets hungry.  Hope you guys can come out!  <eos> \n","<bos> Alright, well, it's the issue a lot of us have had to face. Freshmen year, I was a dumbass and torrented the leaked Game of Thrones episodes. Got caught, got an email about copyright complaint, had to do that short quiz and got my wifi back. All that happened in one day.  This time, I'm less of a dumbass, but I left my torrent downloading while I made my way to campus. It was seeding in the background, and I didn't notice. It was only on for less than 30 minutes even, but I still got an email the next day about copyright infringement. This is my second one. I figured I'll probably have to go talk to them or something.  The thing is, it says that the right department will get in touch with me. They blocked my campus wifi. It's been 6 days, nobody has gotten in touch with me, and my wifi is still blocked. Should I email them and ask? I don't particularly want to of course (in case they forgot or something) but my lack of good wifi is killing me.  What should I do? <eos> \n","<bos> I have one free 3 Topping Pizza from Papa Johns available. I'll send the pizza, you give the driver the tip.

I‘m originally Ethiopian though. Coming here, I really didn‘t know anyone in the country let alone on campus. So I’m having a really hard time making friends. Don’t get me wrong, I was not the most confident/popular kid in school, however, I still had a close group of tight knit friends while also being generally open and sociable to people. I moved around a lot because my dad worked in the airline industry, and I never had any problems making friends no matter where I moved. But here, I’m in an uncomfortable situation where for the first time in my life, I have nobody I can all and say,”Hey, wanna hang out?” My roomstes are chill, but that’s about it, they're from PA, so they have already got a group of pals that they hang out with. Our room is the only one on the floor(becasue we’re on the 2nd block ground floor. ), so no floormates, meaning no point of an open-door policy. I joined a thon org, but people joined in groups so when I show up to a meeting alone, it’s embarrasing when the question comes up, “who did you come with?”. I don’t believe in race groups, but I still signed up for the black caucus just so I can try a make new friends. I‘m trying my best and it’s kinda depressing how I legit have no friends. My goal isn’t to know a lot of “hi/bye” , “How’s the weather?” type of small talk friends you see around. I only want to make a small group of meaningful, long lasting real frindships. So my question is this, Is there an approach you guys recommend that I‘m not taking, and (to upperclassmen) When and how did you guys make your closest friendships?  Thanks. <eos> \n","<bos> I'm considering becoming a SOC 119 TA next semester. Has anyone here been a facilitator for that class?  Was it a rewarding experience?  How much did you learn?

The 50% GPA is 3.55-3.97, which I assume is weighted as the remaining 25% had to have had above a 4.0. My high school submits both the non-weighted and cumulative weighted GPA. I have a 3.76 weighted GPA and a 1210 two part SAT.

I was wondering how bad the class is and whether I should just take statics and strengths of materials separately. Also, does anyone have any comment on the teachers of these classes? For 210 I'll have Suliman, Samia A the only teacher of 210 and for 211 statics I'd have either Awadelkarim, Osama O or Chillara, Vamshi Krishna. Some other background info, I'll be taking Econ 302, math 141 and physics 212l and R along with an engineering first year seminar. How math intensive is 210 and 211? Should I wait till I finish math 141? It's also worth mentioning that I came in with 28 AP credits which explains why I'm not taking that many gen eds. <eos> \n","<bos> I've been here since the beginning of the spring 17 semester, I had no idea what college would be like, I imagined I would have everything under control and in a line in no time. Not the case. I've tried joining clubs, signed up for ~10 but never attended bc of social anxiety, bc of said social anxiety I've had no luck making really any friends, I have no one to study with, nobody to hang out with, I spend most of my time in my dorm, alone. I thought college would be different but now I'm stuck. I essentially screwed myself out of the first semester of college and I have no idea how to fix it. Well, I know exactly how, I have to go and meet people. However, I don't drink and most of the people I know have met people/ socialized through parties and drinking. So in summary I'm a socially anxious non drinker who's unable to make friends. I'd like to remedy this but I have no idea how.

We also have a semester long group project and my group and I turned in the first part of the project last week and suddenly, the next day, the teacher decided to switch me to a different group without notice. I have emailed this teacher probably a dozen times and have received no response (the oldest one was sent over two weeks ago.) I have tried calling his office and it always goes to voicemail. I'm beginning to think he doesn't even exist.

In 2013 I began my degree at a large public University. I had a 3.6 High school GPA and an 1870 on the SAT. I - and my parents - genuinely believed that if I worked hard and put in the extra effort, I would be able to get an engineering degree. For the next 4 years, I proceeded to take STEM class after STEM class and do poorly in it. Eventually I was academically dismissed from the public University and went on to do the exact same thing at Community College (with a better GPA, but still poor results).  At the end of all of this, my cumulative college GPA - of all the coursework I had ever taken - was a 1.9.  It took me an entire semester away from taking classes to re-evaluate my abilities. I worked odd jobs, I completed a ton of Edx/MOOC courses in those 5 months, and I discovered exactly what my strengths and interests really are.  It was after that that I took my last bit of savings and proceeded to enroll into Penn State World Campus as a non-degree seeking student. I am currently a full-time student through World Campus and am praying to every God ever that, if I continue to do as well as I've been doing (my projected GPA for summer session right now is trending towards a 3.0), the University will accept me as a degree-seeking student.  I was told when I started as a non-degree seeking student that, if I prove myself as a full-time student with the prerequisites for the major, the University will accept me as degree-seeking student. But I'm not sure if I can take their word for it. Is there anyone on this subreddit who has experience with going from Non-Degree Seeking Status to Degree-Seeking? <eos> \n","<bos> how fast does parking fill up for lot 43? has anyone had trouble getting a spot? <eos> \n","<bos> My roommate was discussing the Sandusky case with her father, an alum, when he brought something up that made me think.

Fall rush is coming up and I believe everybody should give rushing a chance. Rush, for those who are unaware, is the time during which students can meet the members of prospective organizations and gain a better understanding of what the Greek system really is (I promise you it's much more than what you've heard or seen in movies). I've made best friends for life through the Penn State Greek system and advanced my professional career as well. It is an amazing opportunity for incoming freshmen, as well as returning sophomores. It is also common for Juniors to rush. If anybody is curious about the Greek system, ask me **anything!** <eos> \n","<bos> Sorry if this is a dumb question but i didnt know if there is some place i can look to see where graduates of a specific major are getting jobs at (specifically from Penn State, even by campus if thats a thing) <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, I just got accepted to Penn State's Abington Campus I live in Philadelphia [(19125)]([url link] I'm hoping some of you guys can weigh in your opinion on whether I should commute or find somewhere close by to live. It's about a 45 minute to 1 hour drive. Throw in some traffic. I'd still have to live at my parents house. Long story short: I already live like a poor college student with loud and disruptive people. Small room, pay for rent, no food, can't study/sleep etc. It'd only be 2 years but it'd be hell. Besides the obvious costs, I can't foresee any problems that may come up if I live on off campus housing / apartment. I wouldn't mind a room mate as long as we get along. My grades would be better, I'd enjoy being home, and I'd be on my own. I don't party, drink, or smoke. I just want a place for peace and quiet, minimal driving, and a place to get work done. Sorry if I sounded like a complaining teenager; I tried hard to leave the details in without sounding ungrateful. Any questions, please ask and if you have any advice at all, please. I'm aware of the April 6th housing event and I'll be there. Thanks again.  <eos> \n","<bos> I doubt anyone from the NLF is on Reddit but worth a try.

Penn State was number one on my list, so I am certain to attend in the fall. I've just been curious about a few things. I'm a Non-Pennsylvania Resident, so I had to change my campus to Berks to have a dorm. Now, they had to change my major to Undeclared, and I'm not sure why I couldn't go into Berks with a major intended, but she didn't seem to want to explain further. I am also curious as to what do the dorms look like. I need a visual so I know what to buy and bring with me. (Storage furniture, wall decorations, personal products, etc.) I am aware that Berks is particularly small, and I have a bike. Would it be useful to bring, or should I leave it home/sell it? Is getting a job on campus recommended more than to work off campus? If I don't pay my Deposit Fee early enough, could I really be out of luck with finding a dorm room? How is looking for a place to live off campus?  Thanks in advance!

I'm currently a 3rd semester standing student at Penn State Abington looking to transfer to University Park in the Fall of 2017. I was originally an engineering student however during this semester I realized it's really not for me and I don't enjoy the material. I'm heavily looking (Fairly decided) to switch into the IST program because that looks to be far more up my alley in terms of what I enjoy (Tech and Communications). The prerequisites to get into the major are not hard, they consist of IST 110, 210, and 220 with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 (I have a 3.20). I have not completed any of the three prerequisite courses however I'm taking all three during my fourth semester and I will be passing them. Do any of you know if there is a policy that will not allow me to gain entrance to the college of Information Science and Technology at University Park even though I have completed all of my entrance to majors and have the cumulative GPA high enough to enter?

So if anyone is current student or grad student and needs housing for the fall of 2011 and spring of 2012 then send me a pm. Also if you have the slightest interest I'd like if you sent me a pm and we could meet so that I could give you a quick tour of the place and answer your questions. **Whats available?** A double room and then also another double which has one person in it already and its a matter of finding him a roommate since he's new to the area =P  **DETAILS:** 800 West College Ave. 4 Blocks from N. Atherton and only a block and a half from the red link bus stop.  From this site it is labeled as the \"Fox\" House [url link] Land lord is a cool guy and doesn't scam us with a security deposit so you don't have to worry about losing that money.  Subletting is allowed and 11 parking places for free. However with the unused spots (5 or 6 atm) we plan to rent out and use that cash to help lower our rents. *Remodeled and Rebuilt in summer of 2010  16 person capacity house 4 floors 5 Bath 11 Rooms  **NOT** a frat house!!! NOT a shit hole!!! haha (These two things are not connected! btw so don't be offended I'm just often asked if it is a frat when I tell them the number of ppl that live here) Each room has its own dead bolt locks so you can keep your stuff safe and each room has large closets.  1st floor has a huge kitchen with 2 washing machines, 2 refrigerators, and cabinets everywhere. Also a dining room and large living room with the added bonus of 2 sets of new washing and drier machines which are Free to use! Lower level and Top most level are filled already and most of the second floor which has its own small living room is filled. However, three spaces are left to be filled here.  *Thats all I can think to put in now so send me a pm!  oh btw! one of the girls works at the penn stater and a bakery since she loves to cook so expect lots of home cooked food. Haha I like to add that in as if it is a perk of the house ;D Thanks for reading! <eos> \n","<bos> Hey guys, I'm completing a pc build soon and was looking for a cheap or free version of Windows 10. I'm an incoming freshman to the college of engineering this year. I saw that software.psu.edu offers a free windows upgrade from Kivuto. I did some digging on this subreddit and apparently, people have claimed that it can work even without a previous windows install. I've also looked into the Mircosoft Dreamspark website, which has a clean windows 10 install available--but I don't have a login yet. Is it worth requesting a login an incoming student or not?

The school sent me an email to me recently saying that my aid is on hold, and a few items appeared on my to-do-list.

Very excited since Penn State is where I wanted to go, but I'm curious what the culture is like for graduate students on campus. 1. Is there a big sense of academic pride, like the feeling you WANTED to be at Penn State?  2. Do many graduate students go to football games, local hangouts, etc? And are there any clubs or events just for graduate students? 3. How does Penn State (admin/faculty) regard there graduate students, are we well respected and treated as a student population with a voice in campus events? 4. Are their local hangouts that are known to be \"grad friendly, or mostly on grads hang at?\" 5. What if you get involved in an event or social gathering (I don't really party) that is mostly undergrads. How are you treated, as a respectful peer, or that annoying TA they have in class? I'm just very curious, I went to a small undergrad program and commuted. So this is going to be a big change academically and socially. I'd like to be in a place that can foster both my intellectual mind and give me the chance to meet new exciting students.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hi, I'm incoming freshmen at PSU UP majoring in finance.

I'm interested in a comp sci major or minor, and have done very well in CMPSC 121. Granted it's a very basic course, but I'd hate for calculus to be the reason I look elsewhere.  When I say I'm not doing well, I have gotten a 55 on the first calculus exam. It's not like I didn't put effort in. I'd say I've been rather proactive. Would LionTutors be helpful? Any other resources available? I've been going to Penn State Learning and intend to continue doing so, but clearly that alone isn't cutting it. <eos> \n","<bos> This fall, im enrolled in CHEM 210 with Raymond Funk as my professor.

Penn state has really drawn my attention because of its college town feel, the sport culture down here \\(congrats to Saquon Barkely\\), its reputation and the sheer number of students and obviously the party scene. In Australia our university experience is quite tame, so I'm thinking of experiencing the American College lifestyle at Penn state and travelling around the east coast too. My only concern is the weather. I know that Spring season is extremely cold at University Park, does this affect the experience at Penn state? Or would you say its worth me waiting an extra semester to come down for Fall? I'd love to hear everyones opinions and if possible some thoughts about on campus accomodation too.

I originally was going to study abroad in the spring of my sophomore year but I am pushing that back till junior year. For this reason I chose to request on campus housing, because I assumed I would only be on campus for one semester before I went abroad and did not want to sign for a year long lease. But now since I am staying I don't really want to live in a dorm for another year. I have hardly met anyone besides freshmen who live on campus, which worries me. I realize that I am super late to the apartment application process, however through craigslist I have found a studio apartment downtown for a decent price.

I am a piano hobbyist who came across a piano cover on youtube and one of the comments leads me to a link that possibly contain the sheet music I so desire. However, said link requires psu login info to access what I suspect to be the psu cloud service. Since I am not affiliated to psu, there is no way for me to verify that, and it could also very well be a trap by Russian hackers. With that being said, could any one of you kind souls lend me a hand and access the page to download the sheet music for me?

I'm wondering if anyone could provide some tips for a newbie? Basically...  What color shirt should I be wearing? Do they provide pom-poms or do I buy them somewhere on campus and bring them? What time should I get into the stadium for decent seats? Currently I'm not planning on tailgating since I don't know anyone. Just going to walk over to the stadium and explore while people are having fun. Are people ok with you just wandering around the tailgating areas before the game? Are people generally friendly around you during games? I don't know anyone so I'll be smooshed between thousandrs of other students all on my own!  Are there any groups or events for first timer's like myself to meet others to go to the game? Perhaps it's too late now but I'd be curious, especially if they are other graduate students!

I love the campus and the creamery, as well as the school size and massive amount of school spirit.

What do you like least? * (Penn state admits almost fifty kids from my high school every year so this is a crucial question) How often do you run into people you know/ from your high school? * I'm a member of the marching band and the crew team for my school, what are these programs like at Penn State? * How often do you eat at the creamery? * What are the dorms like? The computers and facilities? * How much of the freshmen fifteen is due to the creamery? * Is Penn State go greek or go home? What's the deal with sororities and frats? What about sorority housing? * Favorite clubs or things to do in such a big campus? * I'll probably be going to summer session. Good choice or bad? * What are my chances of getting a job on campus? * What's your major? Do you like it? What are your favorite classes? Best professors in your opinion? * What's PSU's biggest asset that I should take advantage of next year?

The projects are way over my head and I don't know if I should continue with CS here at Penn State. I've heard that the higher level CS courses make 311 look like a cakewalk, so again, I don't know if it's right for me. I wouldn't want to switch into IST because the job prospects aren't as good as a CS major. That and if I were to go into IST, I'd double major in SRA but I wouldn't graduate on time. So, that leads me to the Data Science major, I did some reading on it and honestly it sounds really interesting. From what I've heard there's a somewhat decent demand for data science grads right now. I believe I would still be able to graduate on time if I switched but I'd have to check with my advisor to see if that's true. Here's what my question is: what are the higher level Data Science courses like? I don't know if I would be able to handle the higher level CS courses, so I want to make sure I could be able to handle higher level DS courses before I switch. Are they impossibly hard? What are some of the professors like? I'm an okay programmer at best, so are the higher level DS courses programming heavy? I know it's ironic that I'm a CS major looking to stray away from programming, but again, most of it is over my head and I'm not sure what to do. If anyone has any advice for me, regarding higher level CS courses and/or higher level DS courses, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks! EDIT: I would also love to stay in Comp Sci, switching would be a worst case scenario. If anyone has any advice for me on how to tackle higher level CS courses I would also greatly appreciate that. <eos> \n","<bos> Hi.

Then we see a busted looking hoopty speeding away from a police cruiser. The car hit the median, ramping off of it and bottoming out, in the process getting a flat tire. They drove another few hundred yards before crossing over to the other side of the street and ditching the thing on Atherton outside of Red Lobster. It didn't appear that the cops had caught him. It actually seemed that the officer tailing him had mistaken another police cruiser in the lot of Red Lobster as the hoopty he was chasing (just in a routine stake out, watching the road for speeding, drunk driving, etc.). Honestly, at the speed he was traveling, if he had not hit the median, he would have gotten away. <eos> \n","<bos> Hey I posted a couple months ago about simple first date ideas in the area.

On LionPath I can't remove the minor from my degree or make any changes. I talked to an advisor for my major (not my assigned advisor) during walk-in hours, and she told me that this isn't a big deal. She said I would just receive an email from my minor's department stating that I didn't complete the requirements, and then it wouldn't show up on my transcript. She pretty much said I don't have to do anything about it. But right now the minor is still listed on my graduation application, my academic requirements, and in other places on LionPath. Is this a problem if I don't complete a minor that's still showing on my degree? Or is there a way to have it removed from my degree even after I've applied for graduation? As long as I can graduate, I don't mind having an unfinished minor on my record. I'm just a bit confused about what the advisor told me, and I wondered if anyone else had done the same thing before. <eos> \n","<bos> Looking over past posts, there seems to be a lot of missing/full courses like CMLIT 191.

We have 3 options going forward: 1. Continue to allow buying/selling threads (with users downvoting posts if they get annoying) 2. Ban buying/selling threads 3. Create a dedicated buy/selling/trading thread to contain posts. **However:** This may not be a feasible option given that there is little we can do to prevent scamming. This post has been put in contest mode to facilitate discussion. In the meantime, we can issue a moratorium on buying/selling posts. We value your input! Discuss.

Personally, I think it's a really bad time/location for a bachelor party, but its what they want and therefore its what I (my brother's best man) want!  I realize this is very late notice, and not a particularly enticing offer considering bachelor parties aren't exactly synonymous with cleanliness. They didn't give me much notice for this and personally I don't think they really thought this whole weekend through.  But I'm DESPERATELY trying to find a place with even a remotely decent location. There are quite a few of us and we would be willing to compensate you however you'd like. We'd also be more than willing to pay for any and all cleaning services (even though we don't plan on making a mess of the place).  It'd mean the world to me and my brother.

If I or others in the class ask her a question she answers and is helpful but there is extremely little structure to the class. i don't even know the right questions to be asking because I have zero experience with wheel thrown pottery. So far all I do is screw around with clay for 2 hours straight and I have no clue what I'm doing.  So for anyone else taking the class, is this normal? Did others have more of a hands on instructor?

Right now I'm a sophomore in high school and my gpa is around a 4.8 weighted, but thats bound to go down to around a 4.6-4.7 because of my current grades that haven't been factored in and also because I am taking harder classes next year (unweighted i have a 4.0 right now but that also will go down). I haven't taken the SAT yet but I got a 1440 on my PSAT. Any thoughts on where I stand? Thanks for your help! <eos> \n","<bos> My brother and I were carrying a couch through a door and we accidentally put a hole in it. Naturally over the course of a few weeks, whenever people got drunk in the apartment we would put more holes in the door using our fists, elbows, feet, heads, etc. Not trying to sugarcoat it, the door was pretty mangled. Last week we get a notification that they're coming to inspect the apartment. My roommate got the brilliant idea of taking a flag and taping it on the door - and it worked perfectly. She even walked through the door without noticing. However, we did state that we had a couple of other problems in the apartment, including a faulty stove. ARPM then decides to surprise us the next morning with a maintenance guy, and the flag fell off the door. He sees the door and says \"Well this isn't good.\" Tells my roommate that he's taking the door immediately and replacing it.  When my roommate asks \"Can we just go to Home Depot and replace it ourselves?\"  \"You might have been able to beforehand but now that I've seen the door I'm gonna have to replace it immediately.\"  \"How much is that going to cost us?\" \"It'll be $500.\" Outrageous. We checked our lease agreement and there's no destruction of property clause that says they can fine whatever they want, it just says that we're responsible for the costs of replacing whatever property we damage. I could probably replace 10 doors with $500. Has anyone else had to deal with this kind of bullshit? Were you able to get out of it?  TL;DR - We damaged a door, ARPM saw it and immediately tries to bill us $500. <eos> \n","<bos> Not necessarily because we would change minds of the government, but only to do this to spread awareness? <eos> \n","<bos> Any past RAs here in this sub?

I was recently accepted to Penn State (UP), and I'm really excited, but my parents aren't as happy. For quite a while now, what I expected to do after finishing high school was the 2+2 plan so that I could commute and live at home the first two years. My parents have always talked about that as if it was the only option, so I kind of just accepted it. But now I'm not sure; I really love University Park and could see myself going there, but it's just so much more expensive. I'm paying for the majority of my college, and I understand that my parents just want me to make a good decision, but would it be stupid/selfish of me to do the four years at main instead? Logically, it makes more sense for me to stay home, but it doesn't feel like that's what I want to do. Basically, is University Park worth it for all four years? Lots of my friends and even some teachers have told me it's worth it to get the \"full college experience,\" but I would love some other opinions. I'm just so conflicted on whether the price or determining where I would be most happy is more important.  <eos> \n","<bos> The guys at uncommon green started a crowdfunding campaign for streets of college towns etched onto pint glasses, similar to their city collection.

I'm typing this because if feels that part of me is lost. I have respect for PSU. I still do. It had a wonderful influence with my life during my graduate school years and I met wonderful people I met and the culture it brings. It allowed me to become social when I wasn't. It allowed me to develop strong friendships when I couldn't anywhere else. It help me develop a stronger value on education and the academic/career decisions I made when I was in grad school.   As I hear more of this scandal, I don't know if I feel remorse, disgusted, embarrassed, angry, etc. as my emotions are fighting for top spot inside of me. It is that feeling in where someone you see immortal reminds you that they are human and have flaws. I just want to hear thoughts from others. how are you dealing with this? are you dealing with it? do you feel embarrassed when you tell people you are from PSU? All I know is that I have to be the best I can be as a PSU alumni. I have to represent the best I can be so that the action of a few does NOT outweigh the actions of the many. <eos> \n","<bos> Do you have to have a Mac to take this class?

It says on the psu transportation site: \"YWH permits are restricted to students with at least 28 approved credits completed living on campus at West Halls.\" Okay, so I guess that means I can't get a resident parking permit, since I've completed zero credits at UPark. What do I do then?  Update: I called the parking office and it turns it out it really was a wording issue. The 28 credits can be completed anywhere. Thanks everyone <eos> \n","<bos> Hello!   I am a high school senior with my year quickly coming to an end, and with that comes looking to college. I am at a point where I am preparing for my New Student Orientation. I have to make the decision of what major I want to focus and what classes to take.   I am currently stuck between the choices of IST and CompSi, and I am getting different answers from everyone I know as to which one is better. Two of my cousins are college seniors, one is in CompSi and the other is in IST. Both think that they are viable majors, but the CompSi one tells me that his is probably a better choice. I was currently looking at CompSi, but I've heard that IST can be more favorable, and I am unsure which path to go.   Is it possible to major CompSi with an IST minor? I am really trying to figure this out and the NSO date is coming quickly.

I am acquiring 2 associates degrees from community college: Business Administration  History. I've been thinking about getting into the IT industry and noticed Penn State offers an IST and MIS degree. I was thinking about going down the MIS route, given I already have business credits from my associates and I can get an IT job with an MIS degree. Overall, if I did go to Penn State my plan was to either get IST or MIS accompanied by their Supply Chain  Information Systems degree (Basically dual major).  For the people that took either IST, MIS, or SCIS: 1. What was your \"timeline\" outcome from getting the degree(s)? 2. What is the course work/load like in terms of what is being taught and the level of difficulty presented in the course? 3. What should my expectations be when pursing these degrees? 4. Does my plan make sense of acquiring either the an MIS or IST, partnered with a SCIS?  Feel free to provide any other information that you feel would be helpful. Thanks! **Background Info** Like mentioned before I'm acquiring two associate degrees from a community college. As far as professional careers go, I started out working remotely for a small but established management consulting firm doing business/market research on all companies and industries the firm followed. I later transitioned into an executive assistant-project/office manager role where I kept track of all firm operations, which included research initiatives, internal IT, as well as client communication/services. Unfortunately the firm couldn't afford to pay me anymore (bankrupt), which resulted in me leaving. I did love the job and learned so much from it than I could have possibly imagined. I definitely would love to do something like that again and grow from it. I especially loved the research, analyzing and learning how companies/industries operate and what affects their business and growth. At the moment I'm working for a school district doing IT support and absolutely hate it. There are many management problems and bureaucratic nonsense that goes on constantly, as well as a whole list of other issues. Not to mention I'm part of a union which is one of the worst things I've ever experienced. I'm currently looking for another position now in either IT or something similar to what I did before, but I would like to try and stay in IT. Sorry for the mini rant. <eos> \n","<bos> I keep seeing that \"its really hard to get into the Smeal school of buisness\" But can't actually find out what that really means.

I just finished the summer session so I'm returning at the end of the week. I am a CS major and I was wondering what kinds of stuff I have to do to score an internship position for next summer? I know it's really really difficult (near impossible) for a freshman to get an internship but I'm determined to do anything and everything to get one. I took a year off before starting college to build up some work experience and I already have a bit before I came here so my resume isn't totally empty. However, most of the stuff I have done aren't exactly related to a programming internship which is what I really want to get into, though I'm fine getting an IT related internship as long as it pays well. I just really need to get money saved up over next summer so that I can pay for apartment rent when I'm a sophomore and I think an internship is the best way to pay for it. However, although I do have fairly light experience in programming languages (python and C++) I haven't really done anything spectacular and I'm not really good enough to program anything to put into a portfolio. I am willing to pick up some books and study like crazy to spruce up my programming skills if necessary for an internship position next summer since I'm only taking comp sci 121 this fall which is a really easy intro python course (which I feel I already know pretty well).  Anyway here's my resume with the personal stuff taken out.

Post a comment here **by Tuesday morning**, with: 1. How many people are coming, and 2. If you can provide a ride from downtown or campus. I'll be making the reservation on Tuesday. Don't forget to bring/wear Reddit swag if you have any. I'm looking forward to meeting you all! UPDATE: I made the reservation for 10-15 people at 6 PM. Looking forward to it! Also, I guess they're not even sure what the law is, but the manager told me that someone older than 25 has to be present. Then the people over 21 can drink at the same table where the under 21s are.

But since everyone has had to switch to 2 factor authentication for email now, it stopped working. Does anyone know how to make it work in Microsoft outlook with 2FA or am I SOL? I guess I could have it set up to Gmail since that seems to work and just have my gmail sent to outlook, but I don't really want to make Gmail the middleman.

From what I have read there are 80, but I am not too sure. 2.) How long is the summer bridge program? What is it like? I am considering not going home in summer since plane tickets are expensive. 3.) How is the work load? For perspective, I am use to taking at least 3 APs a year and at most 5 APs a year. Along with some honors classes. 4.) Do you enjoy being a millennium scholar?

I learned that other people had received this email too, and I wanted to warn people before they use the app: The app requires notifications and locations permission, it asks you to provide your full name, and to verify your psu email. Once you sign up a message says “absolutely no objectionable content” allowed. From what I saw, the message boards are heavily moderated in order to prepare the app for being advertiser-friendly. This actually means there is very little organic content generated and it’s highly exploitative in favor of the app creators. The curated posts are offensively bland and they use :( a lot, in case you didn’t get that they disapprove of something, which you definitely will. Of course this is all my perspective (and maybe I am not the best person for this, given that I’ve mentioned other apps), but the way that this was solicited to us en masse through our university emails is at least cause for concern. <eos> \n","<bos> I am looking for a Penn State League team that wants to participate in the collegian league or has a way to get one started.

It took a strange turn tonight when in desperate need of snacks and what not, we walked to the nearest convenience store, the Diplomart. Planning on a quick in and out, we immediately were confronted by a man standing in front of the customer side of the register. He was acting as if he was part owner of the store and repeatedly asked us what we were looking to buy. On top of that he was asking where we lived, what our jobs were, etc. At this point it seemed pretty clear that he was high on something. Disclaimer: I've partaken in many fun times, with many fun things, but I couldn't peg what this guy was on. He was acting uncomfortably friendly and asking us about every item we picked out. The man at the register who I believe to be the main owner had a strange smile throughout the whole encounter. When I was going to pay, the man in front of the counter said aloud all of our items and their prices to the owner behind the register, then the two had what seemed to be a discussion about me and my friend in their native language. The way he was acting was as if he was going to pay for our items. He even took his wallet out just before telling me I can pay for it at the register, then stepped aside. To be clear, he was standing directly in front of the register the entire time. The total came out to be what looked to be right, but the whole interaction was completely purposeless. We just paid and got out of there, but we were scratching our heads for a half hour trying to understand what actually just happened. Definitely one to remember.  <eos> \n","<bos> Right now I'm at a satellite, and not sure if I'll be going up to UPark this coming Fall or next Fall semester. I want to join a club sport at UPark but there are a few things I was wondering about teams up there. 1. Can anyone try out for a club sport team? 2. Should I contact the coach(es) about my interest to try out before any meetings/tryouts? 3. Do teams (in general, I'm assuming this varies) have a lot of students try out? Does everyone get to stay on teams in some form or are people cut? 4. If the team travels, is transportation provided? If there's anything else that anyone thinks I should know I would really appreciate it.

That is how there were plenty of people verbally attacking Penn State, JoePa, and the students online. These people talked about how horrible Penn State or JoePa is/was. If you remember any person that said this stuff or know of it, remind them that they are not welcome for State Patty's Day this year, no matter what they said/did before or after the events occurred. Those people don't deserve to be allowed at Penn State if they are going to criticize everybody affiliated to the school.

I always use a VPN, and have never been 'caught' or 'disciplined' in any way. Early this January I was conducting business as usual when my internet was taken down due to Rescom detecting that my computer was \"infected\" or \"compromised\" and was part of a botnet or some shit. It was obvious to me that they were just picking up the traffic my computer receives/sends via the VPN, but I obviously couldn't tell them that so I had to have my computer reformatted by them.  Since then I've done all my torrenting on my cell phone's data plan, but it can be a hassle. Has anyone had any similar experiences torrenting this semester (with or without a VPN)? When I was a freshmen I would just torrent directly before I switched to using a VPN, but since they detected the VPN I don't want to take any risks without any confirmation that it's safe.  <eos> \n","<bos> I was wondering if anybody could tell me what my chances are at making it into the main campus.

I went to tutoring and everything, are there any tips you could give me for doing better next time? there is still 2 exams and a final, the first exam is 15% of the final grade, but I dont want to brush it off. Im thinking about going to Lion Tutors weekly reviews, and continuing tutoring. I never took physics in high school, and Im kind of intimidated by the topics, I know I can pass I just need a strategy for this class. Any help would be appreciated.  <eos> \n","<bos> Wisconsin alumni here. I've never been in this subreddit before, and I probably won't be here again.

I putting together a Christmas gift for my wife this year. We tend to give each other sentimental gifts - stuff that doesn't cost much but has a deeper meaning. We have two kids and a lot of our gift budget goes to them and to family, so we try to keep it simple with each other. My idea i basically this. I am putting together a collection of glass bottles that contain \"pieces\" of things from where we spent time together. So, for example, I have a vial right now that is filled with grass and soil from our first home together. I also have a piece of cloth from the blanket that was used to wrap our first born in at the hospital. The reason I'm posting on here is because my wife and I went to Penn State University Park for 3.5 years. We absolutely loved it there, have amazing memories with friends, and overall is a very significant time in our lives.  I'm looking for someone that currently lives in State College to send me some small amount of dirt or gravel or something to that effect from campus. I know she wouldn't know the difference if I got soil from or backyard and SAID it was from Penn State, but I'd rather have the real thing.  If anyone is willing to help me out here, I'm completely ready to pay for the shipping costs for you to send it to me. With Christmas only two months away, I'm looking to do this as soon as possible. Please PM me if you are interested in helping me fulfill this gift for my wife! Thanks in advance to everyone who took the time to read this! EDIT: I really have to thank everyone for the outpouring of messages I've received for this gift idea!!! I've already had someone send me stuff and I couldn't be happier!! Thank you all so much for you support! I'll try to update this post after Christmas with pictures of the final product! Thanks again! <eos> \n","<bos> Gonna be starting grad school in the fall, and already found a place to live, but I am looking for advice on the following: * Where to buy furniture (ideally with delivery, don't think I'll have a car) * Where/when to buy winter clothing (I'm from CA and I've never lived in a place where the weather drops below 40 degrees) * Should I get a car? * Is the bus system efficient? * I'm really excited to live somewhere where it snows. Am I a moron? * I've heard about the PA liquor laws. How do I buy alcohol?

So last month, I was accepted into the graduate Acoustics program at your University, and it's very likely that Penn State is where I'm going to end up for grad school.

My focuses are audio engineering and ultrasound imaging, and I'm getting a minor in jazz performance as well.

Well I decided to do the same thing, but for THON! So for every upvote I receive, I will donate $0.20 to THON. If I reach 50 upvotes, I will double my total! Let the upvotes begin! EDIT: WOW!! I was not expecting this type of response so fast! With only 1,400 subscribers, I didn't think over 100 of them would already be upvoting this! So proud to be a Penn Stater! Let's keep this going and hopefully more people will start doing this! EDIT #2: Okay, so when this post reaches midnight I will see the # of upvotes (not rating) and calculate from there. I already got one redditor on here to hopefully match my total and another friend that will also match it. Right now, between the three of us it will be over $190! Let's keep it up everybody! FINAL EDIT: The highest total of upvotes I saw by midnight was....... 175!!! Which means $35. But since it got over 50 upvotes, I will double that to a total of $70!! Now because of how well this went, plus I am a stickler for clean numbers, let's throw in a $5 bonus, totaling to $75! I will be doing this again next year when I have a job for even more money.

I'm currently living in Alaska, will be 8 hours from State College (in VT) starting late July, and looking to move in at PSU around Aug 15th.  Here are my questions.  1) Is it possible to find something under $700 yet hygienic through online sources like apartmentsstatecollege.com, statecollege.com/apartments, craigslist, etc?  2) For an entering grad student, would you advise risking a random roommate as opposed to doing a studio or 1bedroom for the first year?  3) Is it generally difficult to get someone to sublet from you during the summer? I will be working outside of PA during the summers.  4) I saw a bit of how traffic can be when I visited campus last week. Is driving to campus (and buying a parking pass) ridiculous? I'd like to walk, of course, but since housing within walking distance may be more expensive, wanted to check if I should definitely rule out driving back and forth.  I really appreciate any and all input! Thanks! <eos> \n","<bos> I'm an upcoming junior at UP. I've lived on campus for the past two years and it's been quite a pain trying to \"sprint\" to class from one side of campus to another so I decided to invest in a bicycle.

I just had a few questions that maybe somebody could clarify on. From what I read, Penn State, at least the main campus (I'm not sure about the world campus), does not accept transfers for the IT program. My question is whether I would be able to transfer to a branch campus after a year at a community college and then use the 2+2 Program to switch to University Park for IT. Would this work? I was considering going to Penn Highlands in the case that I get denied from a branch campus. (I'm an adult student.)

However, I am not entirely sure because I am not sure whom I will room with and it is kind of far. If you already lived there, how'd you like it?  Is it easy to meet people and make friends there if you are new and don't know anyone there? What's the social life like at the retreat? The only problem I have is that this is my first semester at Penn State so I don't know a lot of people here. I am new here, and I haven't made a group of friends yet. I just transferred to Penn state this semester.  And also, someone told me that people there tend to keep the themselves and stay within their established friend group. So, I am afraid that if I am living in the Retreat I will be isolated from everyone else. I am having the same problem right now, on my floor everyone seems to be mostly upperclassmen and don't ever talk to each other. Because of that I am having tough time meeting people and making friends here. I am mostly by myself and honestly, it's kind of depressing.

I loved the atmosphere, the people and the idea of THON. So I took over 3 AP classes,two honors classes and joined a variety of clubs to help stand apart from the crowd and get in. Well,it happened and I got into Penn state Altoona (my #1 choice campus) and now had to deal with the next problem- affording Penn state. After A LOT of loans,we still had a **$2,000** gap,and had no option of housing due to a (literally) hundred long waiting list. My mom didn't know what to do,and advised me to look into other colleges. But I urged her to keep calling for me.and though a turn of PURE luck we got connected to Mr.Rick Shaffer,the director of admissions at Penn State Altoona. After telling him my problem he took down our information and told us he'd call us in a week. We hoped that maybe we may get a higher spot on the waiting list for housing,but instead got much more than that. Mr.Shaffer reserved a on campus dorm room just for me,waived my housing and acceptance fees,and gave me a scholarship of over **$7,000** (really for no reason,my mom didn't even tell him of our gap). My mom cried tears of joy,and I was dumbfounded this not only closed our gap,but gave me money left over for books and etc. I received this call today,and it's literally the nicest thing I can recall anyone ever doing for me. I love Penn state and can't wait to join you all in a couple months. Thank you.

Accusations of child abuse are enough to kill a career and are not something you should just throw around as if they hold no weight. He told his superior and also the head of campus police. He wasn't a witness, the witness met with these two people also. Is it so absurd to presume that your boss and the head of campus police did their jobs correctly?

ORIGINALLY, i was supposed to attend PSU from out of state, but tuition was way too high for me because my mom refused any help with loans whatsoever. Since i was moving here for good, I decided it would just be best to not enroll in this semester and go back next year (which would hopefully help for in state tuition.) So i have a job now, state ID, lease, health insurance, switched banks, and i have my drivers exam next month and i'll be getting car insurance for that. Then i would go back in 2018, either the spring or fall semester, (most likely fall). Would it be hard for me to get my tuition lowered? My mother was very abusive and does not support me in any way at all, and i was going to submit an appeal for lower tuition around next year if i do go in fall.  <eos> \n","<bos> locations please? crowd sourcing information here. <eos> \n","<bos> Does anyone know anything for sure about retirees and Office365?

All three have rejected me, claiming that they have no positions available but I think it's just because I'm a freshman. Am I doing something wrong? Help.

He and I are both third-semester sophomores at Penn State Harrisburg doing concurrent majors in IST and SRA. If we choose to go with the 2+2 plan, as many of you probably already know, we can go to University Park for our junior and senior years. However, we’re unsure of what to expect for a lot of what goes on up there, so we were hoping someone with experience could help us out. First, is getting good housing at UP as difficult to get as I hear? Here at PSH, it’s not difficult at all to get a [four-person off-campus apartment that’s walking distance from campus, and each of us have our own room and sink and we have two bathrooms]([url link] Are there dorms/apartments at UP like this? How difficult is it to get on-campus housing anyway? Another question of ours, how long is your commute to class, on average? Walking to class from our apartment as it stands is about a fifteen minute walk. We obviously expect a longer walking distance, but are also aware of alternative options such as public transportation. Does the time to get to class differ significantly from on to off-campus housing? In addition, are teaching assistants common at UP? They’re practically unheard of here, and I don’t know what to expect from a course with one. Maybe people just make an irrationally big deal of them for all we know. Neither of us are really into parties or sports. However, (much) more than one place to eat, facilities that were actually designed to be used as a university and not an Air Force base, better resources for our major and class selection, being with our friends that are also transferring, and more stuff to do in general is kind of drawing us there. But our biggest reasons for staying are concerns about commute time, housing, professors, and class difficulty. I realize I kind of rambled, but we would really appreciate any input anyone might have to offer. We've been mulling this over for almost a year now and are starting to run out of time. Thank you for your time. <eos> \n","<bos> See that text next to my name? Looks cool, right?

Temple is obviously the better choice for the college experience thab Harrisberg. Although Harrisburg is looked down upon because it is not main campus, the degree says Penn State and not Harrisburg. This means the the degree you get from there is just as good and held on the same pedestal as the degree from main campus. I want to go to Temple but I have read in many places that people with the Penn State degree have an easier time finding jobs and jobs that pay more compared to Temple. Is it that some people only come to party mess up those statistics or does the degree in the same major from two different schools matter? Should I go to Temple or stick out Harrisburg for 2 years and then go to main? (sorry for posting on a penn state thread but I love both schools) <eos> \n","<bos> I'm wondering if anyone knows some good parks around State College? I have a car available so that's not an issue (that might even be preferred). I know of a lot of nature trails, but I'm more looking for places that just have nice fields to sit down and have a picnic/run around. Basically, looking for less hiking and more just nature. I know about the arboretum and things like that but those are a little small and also can get pretty crowded with people. We're looking more for a space to just explore nature.  <eos> \n","<bos> Title  <eos> \n","<bos> Is it just senior staying in their apartments and going out to bars the week after graduation? <eos> \n","<bos> I am wondering what other people's branch campus experiences were/are.

I'm living in pollock on a completely anti-social floor, and my major is really small so I haven't really been able to meet anyone. I tried joining different clubs at the start of the year but nothing really stuck. I', moving off campus next year so I'll now have even less of a chance to meet people. I'm at a crossroads and I have no idea what to do. I'm not an anti-social or socially awkward guy by any means, just a regular dude. It seems like everyone still hangs out with their high-school buddies, or is only interested in making friend with people who have connections to parties. <eos> \n","<bos> When does the money normally get deposited in the checking account? <eos> \n","<bos> [Crosspost]([url link] Available to any cool redditors and/or alumni, shoot me a PM <eos> \n","<bos> A few of us planned that on this Sunday, May 20th, we are going to meet at Tudek Park (Location: 400 Herman Drive, State College) we are meeting there at 2 and leaving around 6.

I went to the ID office at the hub and they said nothing was wrong with my card and issuing a new one wouldn't really solve the problem. So I went back to rec hall to tell them what the ID office said and they said to bring a printout of my gym membership confirmation. No problem, right? Wrong. Webmail had me empty my trash folder almost 2 months ago so that confirmation was lost. Does anybody know ways to get around rec halls crappy card readers?

Because of this, my loans haven’t been posted to my account, yet. I’m just worried they won’t process everything before the date the bill is due (August 27).

This is my first semester here, but I have attended 3 semester at another college, I noticed on the qualification stated that: \"Second semester (or higher) standing\". Well technically I am a junior in term of credit, does that count as second semester or higher? I also (atleast at the moment) don't have a GPA from Penn State. However, for the courses that I want to tutor are transfered from my old school and have equivalent courses at PSU. I did really well in them and I have outside experiences as well. I don't know if that qualify as \"A, A-, or B+ grade (or equivalent experience) in any course you wish to tutor\".

We're on pretty friendly terms the other side of the house, which is also all guys.

Now, a couple weeks later, I just have this feeling that Penn State is right for me. I've done a couple of searches and found out that paying a deposit at one school and going to another is an unethical thing to do (who would've thought.) I've also found out that if one of the schools found out that you did this, one or both may take away your offer of admission. I honestly have no idea what to do. I know my parents will be mad if I tell them how I feel, but I would rather have that than feel like I missed an opportunity by going to another school. I just need some advice, and if I do go through and decide to attend Penn State, how do you think Pitt would react? (I would obviously send them an email first and explain the situation) I know this is a weird predicament but I would appreciate any help. Thanks  <eos> \n","<bos> Save the spiel that I should attend because I'll only do it once, do I have to attend to receive my degree?

I am really desperate for students and graduates 18 years or older to take a survey for my masters dissertation on rural Americans' knowledge of and attitudes about study opportunities abroad. If you are 18 or older, grew up in a rural area, and are either a current student, recent graduate, or about to start a new higher education program (Bachelor's or above), please please please take a moment to complete the survey. Even if you didn't study abroad and don't plan to, I still want your input! It won't take more than 20 minutes to complete. If you can, please share this with other rural students and recent grads. The more responses I get, the better my dissertation will be. Here is the survey: ([url link] I promise that you won't be asked for any personally identifying information, not even an email address or name, so you don't have to worry about being spammed or anything like that.

I've been told my numerous people that getting into Engineering at University Park as a Freshman is very difficult unless you have stellar stats, which I unfortunately don't (3.67 W GPA, 1230 SAT). But then I heard about some people going into PSU Main as undecided, and after completing their first year they applied for transfer to College of Engineering. I've tried googling for answers, but most of them are from 3+ years ago so I don't know if that information still applies now.  <eos> \n","<bos> Pretty much the title.

He is enrolled in main campus for the summer, but asked to be enrolled in the fall when he applied. He was accepted for the fall, and when he sent in his deposit he explicitly explained that he wanted to be enrolled in the Fall. Today, two days before we head on out to do some fitcap stuff or whatever he's been doing these last few weeks, he gets mail saying that his roomate is &lt;name and that he is able to move in yadda yadda yadda, We call and they tell him that he should be coming to school June 24th. NO He's working as an assistant manager at a job here which is why he asked to not be enrolled in the summer and now we have 12 days to either fix the problem, or my twin is being thrown into college, unprepared against his will. Edit: Thank you for the few comments. We have go it all straightened out. I guess he's leaving next week... No bills have arrived for summer sessions, and no letters have come warning him that he starts classes soon.

A friend of mine was working at an internship this semester and the company revoked the offer, immediately firing her because she went to Penn State. Other people have said they accepted full time job offers only to have them revoked. It is unclear whether they are related to the Sandusky case or the rioting, but some have given direct reasons of the students currently attending Penn State. As a graduating senior, this is terrifying. Not only do we have to fight to find jobs, now we have to overcome our school's controversy.

I go to the Abington campus and my major is IST. i'v been here for almost 3 years, but i'm considered a sophomore since i dropped a semester due to health issues. So i wasn't aware that i had to request a change of campus during my entrance to major, and i put in a request form yesterday for spring 2013 and got denied. The email said my opportunity was fall12, this current semester. So as of now my heart is heavy and very disappointed at myself because the friend i was going to room with has been accepted for spring 2013.

I'm currently a FL student applying to multiple other schools, but I really want to come to Penn State. What's killing me is the 47,000+ tuition fees over my head. I know financial aid isn't going to offer me much, so my next best bet lies in grants, co-op and scholarships, and I don't know how readily I'll be finding those. I don't want to lose heart in potentially transferring to Penn. Anyone here with similar circumstances? What do I need to know? How do I cover the costs on my own?

I'm just helping them get the word out... which makes me the self-proclaimed head of their marketing department lol. I figured you PSU redditors would appreciate the site as it is similar to reddit. It's pretty easy to use and convenient especially if you are looking for something like easy GH/GA classes, which I have been struggling to find myself. You can also use this site to find rides home or sell books, etc.  Everything is free. All you have to do is make an account and start posting!  It would mean a lot if we could get some help from you redditors. Also we need a lot of help marketing. We like to employ guerilla marketing techniques. For example, last year we had a group of students running around throwing paper airplanes into the large lecture halls. It was pretty cool seeing like 30 paper planes flying from the top of 100 Thomas all the way to the podium at the bottom. We also had about 50 shirts made last year. We distributed them by literally walking into classes before the professor arrived, told the students who we were, and just threw the shirts at the hottest girls in the room. So the marketing side of this site is pretty fun and unique. If you'd like to join just post here.

I just watched a YouTube video on the Paterno/Sandusky scandal and I remembered how the Penn State students were almost militant in their support for Paterno when it happened, and the outrage that started when his statue was removed.

Now that I don't need to travel anymore, I am thinking of switching to Main to get a \"college experience.\" Keep in mind I have done online classes since high school, and will be 22 years old when I start the second half of my junior year. I guess the main reason I want to do it is for social reasons (haven't been able to make friends or relationships too well with the travel), but also to tap into the resources a campus has to offer like clubs  forming a relationship with profs for LOR's.  Do you think it's worth it? <eos> \n","<bos> Can anyone recommend a good sports talk radio station for Penn State?

Now I'm in o-chem 2 and I have NO strategy on how to study the subject. All my friends in the class get decent grades and they tell me they don't read the textbook and just focus on memorizing all the reactions (I have been reading the textbook-- it takes up huge chunks of time to wade through the words and I still end up failing). Is this how the class should be approached? I'm just trying to pass (get a C) and I can't afford to fail this next exam. What did you do to pass O-chem 2?

[url link] If you don't have the time to watch, Stewart pretty much rips us apart for the Wednesday riot. He says all the students care about was some football coach and not the victims of Jerry Sandusky. He then makes an appalling metaphor that says we were raped by the administration, but we'll recover in later years (a la the victims). We need to show Stewart photos of the real Penn State. The one that took place on Friday night. The Candlelight Vigil represents the very best of us. Here are two ways we can contact the offices of Comedy Central.  Press Email Information [url link] Comedy Central Questions and Comments [url link] I consider Jon Stewart to be one of the most honest and honorable newscasters out there, although he will never admit it. His desire to report the truth exceeds that of the anchors on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. However, he fell in line with the mainstream media, took part in sensationalism, and portrayed the university as a place without morals. It is necessary that show him that we care about the victims of sexual abuse.   <eos> \n","<bos> I've tried Rag and Bone (close but didn't fit), Goodwill and the little thrift shop on Fraser and Beaver.

By that I mean, roommates are gone, and the other few close friends I have up here are also gone. Kind of going stir crazy, wondering if anyone else is around? I work at the Best Buy on Atherton, and I have to be here to work for the week and on Black Friday. Just to run through some basic stereotypes, I do drink, I don't smoke (weed or cigarettes or anything) and don't really like that stuff (not that I have anything wrong with people who do it, I just don't want to be around it), and I'm straight (if that makes a difference). Not socially awkward, I enjoy having fun, I play guitar, I have 55 hours in Skyrim already (that's what being alone for a break does to you, right?), and I play many other games as well. Guy(s), girl(s), I don't really care. Just looking for some fun and some distractions! This isn't a throwaway, but more of a lurker account. I'm a big-time redditor, if that matters. Regardless, everyone have a good break, and stay strong through all of the scandal bullshit! <eos> \n","<bos> Understandably reddit might not be the best means to conduct this opinion poll, but I just wanted to hear some thoughts.

It was one of the most moving experiences of my life so far. To see that many people coming together to show solidarity with one another and to stand and support the victims of that evil man was truly inspiring. I cried. And it takes a lot for me to cry. So I say, thank you, Penn State. The people here have restored my faith that we are bigger than this. We will get past it. And we are..

While the NCAA makes the claim that it \"is the oversight party of the Athletic community in which Penn State operates\", I do not believe that they have the jurisdiction to stray so far away from the field and issue these sanctions. If anything, this gives the NCAA the jurisdiction to control every on field and off field incident at just about every university that plays sports. If they don't like your mascot, sanction. If they don't like your fight song, sanction. This brings up the question to why Penn State accepted such harsh conditions, and the answer is publicity. If Penn State were to challenge even one of the many sanctions, they would surely look like a monster of a school still not taking the blame for past actions. 2. I believe that the punishment, while mostly deserved, was way to harsh. It's one thing to punish the people involved, i.e. the one that shall not be named, Curely, Spanier, ect. but it is a totally different thing to punish an entire university for the actions of some big wigs at Old Maine... The sanctions effectively destroys the football program for decades and punishes mot only the football team but the band, cheerleaders, ect. for the actions of a single man. 3. The punishment came out way too quickly and with out proper investigations and interviews. The consensus with most people is that the Freeh Report is the straight up truth, well that file is 500 pages of circumstantial evidence with no definitive facts. While some of the information supplied could be true, more time is needed. Before such ridiculous sanctions are put out, lets first finish the trials and more importantly gather all the possible evidence before we start going out burning witches and make such rash decisions that destroys the legacy of the greatest coach ever. <eos> \n","<bos> I went there today and it was delicious, definitely going back. <eos> \n","<bos> Are there any buildings on campus where I can go onto the roof? <eos> \n","<bos> Looking for good local food, breweries, and sites.

I am a writer for a website called “Armchair All-Americans”, a site consisting of primarily college students.

Where do companies usually outsource their drug screens to in town? Will it be somewhere I can take a bus or walk to? I am just assuming it will take place in State College because they had me put that down as a place of preference for the screen on my hiring paperwork.

I'd like to grow my campaign team. If you're interested in learning more about me and the campaign, please check out [url link] and [url link] The campaign team descriptions are listed below. You can apply at [url link] or via the campaign Facebook page, whichever you prefer.  We'll be hosting a campaign team information session on Thursday, January 18 at 7p in room 241 of the State College Municipal Building, 243 S. Allen Street. That's your chance to meet the existing campaign team, learn more about the campaign, and ask questions about the positions we're looking to fill. We'll have light snacks and drinks.  COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR A committed, highly-organized person with experience in professional communications. You will handle all of the campaign’s interactions with the media, which will require building and maintaining relationships with several dozen press outlets, serving as the campaign’s primary spokesperson to the media, and setting up interviews for the candidate.  SCHEDULER A detail-oriented, highly-organized, and logistically-minded person. You will serve as the point person for the campaign’s day-to-day responsibilities, and be responsible for coordinating the campaign calendar and assigning the candidate’s time between fundraising, travel, meet-and-greets, and other campaign opportunities.  TECHNOLOGY MANAGER A tech-savvy individual with experience across various web-based workflow management environments. You will coordinate the campaign’s web-based workflow, and must be available to solve technology-related issues either in person or remotely as they arise.

It's clear that the course is not making an effort to teach valuable skills or serve as part of the larger major curriculum; the professor is using it as a place to force the professor's personal, biased agenda on students. The nature of the course itself does not align with the official course description from the university. Additionally, the professor's grading scale is disingenuous and badly constructed...like nothing we've ever seen in college before, ever. Looking to have something done about this because this course should absolutely not be allowed to continue like this for future students.  <eos> \n","<bos> Hey.

I am giving a short speech about \"propaganda on campus\", a topic chosen by the professor, and I figured I would crowd source for some ideas. **I am not looking for an explanation as to why you think it is propaganda**, I want to do the actual thinking.

I would like to ask the Penn Staters here on which season (Fall or Spring) offers a better experience, taking into account the events held and things to do at PSU. I know that THON is a pretty big thing at Penn State and it is held during the Spring season -- would you say it is an integral part of the Penn State experience that an exchange student shouldn't miss?  I am currently offered Fall 2017 but I still have time to change it to Spring 2018 if I want to. My other considerations are the weather conditions during the respective seasons and which offers a better scenic view while I travel. Also, what are the things that you guys recommend an exchange student do at PSU or even in the state of Pennsylvania itself? I also intend to travel outside of Pennsylvania so recommendations on cool places in nearby states would be nice too.  <eos> \n","<bos> I know there is state patty's weekend and alumni weekend just passed but what others are there?

I plan to enlist in the Air Force July 2017. I'm currently set to enroll in the world campus this upcoming summer. I needed a online program due to the fact that I'm currently nowhere near able to physically go to the school.  If I just major in SRA I can finish before the end of summer 2017. However, if I double major IST/SRA and work pretty hard I would have about 6-7 classes left to complete after summer 2017. I ideally would like to work with networks(which is what I plan to do while I'm in) and after that go the security engineer route. Would it benefit me more to just get the SRA degree or double major to have a better chance at my career? <eos> \n","<bos> On both interviews, he referred to the top healthcare facilities available in Houston for his son.

Having a Big 10 team in the National Championship game will greatly improve recruiting some of the players that would never think to come to a team outside of the SEC.

To be honest I'm very surprised with how pricey they all are. Here in Europe I'm paying $12 a month for 1GB of data, unlimited texting/calling. It's a decent plan for me as that's all the data I need a month. In SC I'd probably need some more data a month - at least 2GB - to stay connected with my family even when I'm somewhere without WiFi.  I can't do Verizon or Sprint as my phone isn't compatible with those networks. I can do ATT and T-mobile - and probably many more, just haven't looked into any others at this point. Based on some previous posts here it looks like reception can be a bit tricky in SC...and I also need to go for one of those plans you don't need credit to get, as I naturally as a foreigner have none. Looked into ATT - 2GB, $30 + access charge (wtf?) $25 = $55 a month... seriously? What? Why? How? Isn't there anything cheaper out there? Is it normal to pay this much a month in the US?  <eos> \n","<bos> Tell us what things were like and what odd things happened when you first ended up at PSU (or in State College). Thought it'd be a good idea to see how things have changed (or stayed the same). I'll start with a few: * Facebook didn't exist. Angel was only used by a handful of professors, and it sucked just as bad back then. * The Mezzanine (formerly the Cell Block) was The Crowbar, and they brought in half-decent music acts. * The Men's BB team had double the win % of the Football team. Yet, the Women's BB team had better attendance than the Men's BB team. * To get under the Life Sciences bridge, you had to walk thru a dimly lit tunnel of scaffolding and plywood. * Geeks and nerds mourned the loss of Playland. * The Creamery was on Shortlidge Rd, and they (still) didn't mix flavors. * A girl fell to her death in an elevator shaft in Atherton Hall after trying to climb out of a stuck elevator. * You didn't need to be on a list, show a PSU ID, or even be a PSU student to get into a frat party. * Bill Pickle's Tap Room was a ~~clothing~~ shoe store. * A drunk guy died choking on his own vomit while being held down by bouncers in Calder Alley. * THON was in Rec Hall, and it was 48 hours. * Five Guys was a Wendy's. * Joe Paterno was head football coach. MORE: * Student IDs were horizontal, included a smart card on them (for laundry), and we used our SS# for test taking. * E-mail/PSUID only had 3 numbers and didn't start with 5. * The S-Zone and the band were in the endzone. Zombie Nation wasn't that popular. White Outs didn't exist...yet.

I've been researching and I'll be applying with the 2+2 plan (ending at University Park) but I'm having difficulty deciding the starting campus. I think I'll be choosing either Altoona or Behrend, but I'm open to changing my mind.

He's had 2 seasons at PSU: 8-4 and 7-5 , great for the circumstances PSU is in but not top caliber college football record. Plus there are many bad losses PSU had in those 2 seasons.  Houston paying his $6.5 mil buyout plus beating his $3.2 million salary for a coach who didn't even go ranked in his two season in college football seems a bit crazy to me. Also reports came out his agent reached out to PSU to try to lower his buyout after he was contacted by NFL teams....which means these teams probably told him his buyout was still to high.  We don't know what will happen until it does but that's my view on things. <eos> \n","<bos> I’m currently attending a branch campus and am required to take CAS100A for my major.

And, also, I went to the zone days in the fall semester, but I did not hear back from all the fraternities.  Is rush competitive at Penn State?

As a recent grad who was at Penn State for the fallout of the Football-Industrial Complex/Grand Experiment/Tarnished \"Old State\" I hope to occasionally hear about the evolving culture of the school. I suppose not much has changed; a compulsive longing for the way things used to be and a blinding obsession with the \"Football is Penn State\" mentality.  As this post relates to Onward State- come on! Your front page has nothing but up to the minute minutia about who is going to be the next celebrity head coach in town. I used to regard Onward State as a reputable and even ballsy news source for journalism that provided critical commentary and inquiry into what is going on at Penn State.  <eos> ', '<bos> Is it possible to take ECON 102 online?

I have a few people already, but I'm hoping to have 5-6 players who are actually interested and are wanting to play about every week for 3-5 hours. As far as players... if you are a beginner, great! I can send you some material to read and we'll be on our way. It will absolutely help you to actually read it if you've never played any kind of tabletop RPG before, because the interactions take some time getting used to. If you are not a beginner, here are some things I want you to keep in mind: 1. No min/maxing. Obviously you can try to make your character good, but the goal should not be to make a character that's stronger than everyone else's because you know more about the game. I'll probably use dice rolls for attributes. 2. No derailing, beyond what's reasonable. Be considerate of other people and what they want to do as the party. Obviously you can roleplay, but the majority of the session should not be taken up by you trying to come up with schemes that no one else wants to participate in. To enforce this, I'll generally just kill your character if you do anything stupid repetitively. 3. Be considerate. Obviously, people taking 5 minutes for turns isn't fun when you planned what you want to do three turns ago, but if someone is struggling, give them advice instead of getting impatient. <eos> \", \"<bos> I can't wait to be a lion!

This is your opportunity to tell us something about yourself that is not already reflected in your application or academic records. We suggest a limit of 500 words or fewer.

GPA is one of the top priorities for Grad Schools and I have heard that PennState is known to have a low average because of the rigorous classes.

Does this end up being cheaper, or are there an abundance of hidden surcharges, etc that make up the difference?

I loved O\\'Brien as much as the next guy, but everyone needs to understand that Penn State has entered a staunchly different Post-Paterno era.  O\\'Brien was one of the best hires in college football two seasons ago, especially for the situation that Penn State was in. His recruiting helped PSU Football get back on its feet and get past the murkiness of 2011. I\\'m seeing a remarkable amount of negativity towards O\\'Brien: People saying he\\'s not a true \"Penn Stater\" for leaving and that this is a selfish move that shows he wasn\\'t the right man for the job. I can\\'t agree with this logic. BoB was one of the best coaches in all of college football, so you\\'re simply wrong if you ever thought that he\\'d stay here for an extended amount of time.

Despite Beaver Stadium being packed once again--united--we couldn\\'t establish a solid foothold into our program\\'s new era. However, there was one moment which was genuinely heartfelt and magnificent--some may even say, *healing*. It occurred during the singing of our Alma Mater. Like many other universities, we rose from our seats, link arms, and sang our song before this football. But this time it was special. For those of you who don\\'t know (hopefully none of you) these are the lyrics to \"Raise the Song\": \" For the glory of old State, For her founders strong and great, For the future that we wait, Raise the song, raise the song. / Sing our love and loyalty,  Sing our hopes that bright and free  Rest, O mother dear, with thee,  All with thee, all with thee. / When we stood at childhood\\'s gate, Shapeless in the hands of fate, Thou didst mold us, dear old State, Dear old State, dear old State. / **May no act of ours bring shame,** To one heart that loves thy name. May our lives but swell thy fame, Dear old State, dear old State. \" Not that 90,000 of us chanting our Alma Mater is quiet by any stretch of the imagination, but during the singing of the emboldened line \"May no act of ours bring shame,\" we truly gave it our all. Here we were, at the moment the 3rd largest city in PA, gathered in unison, not singing, but proudly declaring (yelling, really) our misstep and our now-prerogative.  It was bellowing. It was magnificent. And once the game was over, and our players were walking off the field solemn and heartbroken, we gathered and sang it again.  I share this with you because the description \"proud\" simply doesn\\'t suffice. It was a defining moment of our university, and hardly any non-Penn Staters experienced it. It was a reminder that we are more than what happened to us this past year. We are a gigantic but great crowd of individuals who really contribute something to this world. We are. <eos> ', \"<bos> I was just curious as to whether or not I could get into Penn State for chemical engineering. I'm currently a junior in high school and really need some guidance.

We were surprised because everyone in our neighborhood and at her school (Philly exerbs) HATES Penn State. They refer to it as a cult and say that people who went there are awful. Last night a couple of friends told my wife that they would not send their kids there if it was free-- \"anywhere but Penn State\". They were like this even before the Sandusky business and have been talking for years about how they hope the scandal will destroy the school. I come from the Midwest, where passionate college fans are pretty common, so Penn State does not seem that unusual/awful to me. What is wrong with people who love their school well after college? We have not heard any rationale explanation for what I started calling Nittanyphobia-- Fear of Penn State.  Does anyone here have insight about the hatred in Philly about Penn State? Why do people in Philly hate the school so much? Is there a reason that I should be worried about sending my daughter to a \"blue and white cult\"?

It's a minor within the College of IST, and they're very strict about prerequisites. I have plenty of room in my schedule- it's not that. I could very easily fit 12+ IST courses before my normal graduation date but I hadn't picked this minor until fall of my sophomore year and my planning with my adviser didn't show any problems until this semester.. (study abroad and work experience have complicated things) I'd spoken with undergrad advising at IST semi-frequently and they were very adamant that there are no exceptions to the order in which they make you take the courses. No taking prereqs concurrently, no taking courses out of order, etc.  Anyway, I'm a techie that was enjoying supplementing my major with this minor, but I'm not clear whether I want to push back my graduation to take a single IST course.  edit: would probably be able to pick up a second minor in a foreign language if I postpone, as well, though I don't know whether even that justifies the cost <eos> \", '<bos> I\\'m a student from NYC who will be going to University Park soon.

None of them seemed to mind. I got to one stand, of 3d art (remaining vague on purpose). As I was taking pictures the artist herself came up to me and **shoved my camera away**, saying that I couldn't take pictures. Needless to say, it left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a fingerprint on my lens. I looked on the website and there's nothing that bans photography there.

I\\'ve gotten a few messages from people who are looking forward to tomorrow! I know I am! Here are the final details: * **What:** PSU Grad Student meetup! * **Where:** ZBar (113 Heister St in Downtown State College, PA). Same building as Saloon/Deli, across the street from Chipotle. * **When:** Friday, 10/17. 10 PM - Whenever we go home * **Why:** To give grad students a chance to meet other grad students outside of their department/lab, and hopefully make a few new friends! If this gets enough people, it can hopefully be a recurring thing. * **Who:** Any grad student at PSU (Masters, Ph.D, M.D, J.D, etc) who is friendly and willing to meet new people is welcome to attend! This offer also extends to our combined undergrad/masters students! * **How we will meet up:** I will be waiting at the corner of ZBar furthest from College Ave on Heister a bit before 10 PM. I am a male with brown hair, and will be wearing a black button down shirt. I will do my best to make sure I don\\'t accidentally get stuck in a crowd so that I\\'m visible. Once a few people show up, we\\'ll go inside. Alternately, you can shoot me a PM with your number, I\\'ll send you mine, and you can text me if you are having trouble finding us. We will most likely be at ZBar the whole time, so we should still be there even if you come after 10. If you arrive after we\\'re already inside, come in and look around. I\\'ll do my best to keep an eye out for anyone who seems \"lost\". Also, **even though we\\'re meeting at a bar, drinking is not a requirement.** So, please feel free to come even if alcohol isn\\'t your thing!

Right now we have a couple different Munchkin card games, the game of things, settlers of catan, and someone's bringing their magic cards (so if you have them and want to play, bring them!).

I‘m originally Ethiopian though. Coming here, I really didn‘t know anyone in the country let alone on campus. So I’m having a really hard time making friends. Don’t get me wrong, I was not the most confident/popular kid in school, however, I still had a close group of tight knit friends while also being generally open and sociable to people. I moved around a lot because my dad worked in the airline industry, and I never had any problems making friends no matter where I moved. But here, I’m in an uncomfortable situation where for the first time in my life, I have nobody I can all and say,”Hey, wanna hang out?” My roomstes are chill, but that’s about it, they're from PA, so they have already got a group of pals that they hang out with. Our room is the only one on the floor(becasue we’re on the 2nd block ground floor. ), so no floormates, meaning no point of an open-door policy. I joined a thon org, but people joined in groups so when I show up to a meeting alone, it’s embarrasing when the question comes up, “who did you come with?”. I don’t believe in race groups, but I still signed up for the black caucus just so I can try a make new friends. I‘m trying my best and it’s kinda depressing how I legit have no friends. My goal isn’t to know a lot of “hi/bye” , “How’s the weather?” type of small talk friends you see around. I only want to make a small group of meaningful, long lasting real frindships.

In 2013 I began my degree at a large public University. I had a 3.6 High school GPA and an 1870 on the SAT. I - and my parents - genuinely believed that if I worked hard and put in the extra effort, I would be able to get an engineering degree. For the next 4 years, I proceeded to take STEM class after STEM class and do poorly in it. Eventually I was academically dismissed from the public University and went on to do the exact same thing at Community College (with a better GPA, but still poor results).  At the end of all of this, my cumulative college GPA - of all the coursework I had ever taken - was a 1.9.  It took me an entire semester away from taking classes to re-evaluate my abilities. I worked odd jobs, I completed a ton of Edx/MOOC courses in those 5 months, and I discovered exactly what my strengths and interests really are.  It was after that that I took my last bit of savings and proceeded to enroll into Penn State World Campus as a non-degree seeking student. I am currently a full-time student through World Campus and am praying to every God ever that, if I continue to do as well as I've been doing (my projected GPA for summer session right now is trending towards a 3.0), the University will accept me as a degree-seeking student.  I was told when I started as a non-degree seeking student that, if I prove myself as a full-time student with the prerequisites for the major, the University will accept me as degree-seeking student.

Rush, for those who are unaware, is the time during which students can meet the members of prospective organizations and gain a better understanding of what the Greek system really is (I promise you it's much more than what you've heard or seen in movies). I've made best friends for life through the Penn State Greek system and advanced my professional career as well. It is an amazing opportunity for incoming freshmen, as well as returning sophomores. It is also common for Juniors to rush. If anybody is curious about the Greek system, ask me **anything!** <eos> \", '<bos> Sorry if this is a dumb question but i didnt know if there is some place i can look to see where graduates of a specific major are getting jobs at (specifically from Penn State, even by campus if thats a thing) <eos> ', \"<bos> Hey guys, I just got accepted to Penn State's Abington Campus I live in Philadelphia [(19125)]([url link] I'm hoping some of you guys can weigh in your opinion on whether I should commute or find somewhere close by to live. It's about a 45 minute to 1 hour drive. Throw in some traffic. I'd still have to live at my parents house. Long story short: I already live like a poor college student with loud and disruptive people. Small room, pay for rent, no food, can't study/sleep etc. It'd only be 2 years but it'd be hell. Besides the obvious costs, I can't foresee any problems that may come up if I live on off campus housing / apartment. I wouldn't mind a room mate as long as we get along. My grades would be better, I'd enjoy being home, and I'd be on my own. I don't party, drink, or smoke. I just want a place for peace and quiet, minimal driving, and a place to get work done. Sorry if I sounded like a complaining teenager; I tried hard to leave the details in without sounding ungrateful. Any questions, please ask and if you have any advice at all, please. I'm aware of the April 6th housing event and I'll be there. Thanks again.  <eos> \", \"<bos> I doubt anyone from the NLF is on Reddit but worth a try.

Penn State was number one on my list, so I am certain to attend in the fall. I've just been curious about a few things. I'm a Non-Pennsylvania Resident, so I had to change my campus to Berks to have a dorm. Now, they had to change my major to Undeclared, and I'm not sure why I couldn't go into Berks with a major intended, but she didn't seem to want to explain further. I am also curious as to what do the dorms look like. I need a visual so I know what to buy and bring with me. (Storage furniture, wall decorations, personal products, etc.) I am aware that Berks is particularly small, and I have a bike. Would it be useful to bring, or should I leave it home/sell it? Is getting a job on campus recommended more than to work off campus? If I don't pay my Deposit Fee early enough, could I really be out of luck with finding a dorm room? How is looking for a place to live off campus?  Thanks in advance!

I'm currently a 3rd semester standing student at Penn State Abington looking to transfer to University Park in the Fall of 2017. I was originally an engineering student however during this semester I realized it's really not for me and I don't enjoy the material. I'm heavily looking (Fairly decided) to switch into the IST program because that looks to be far more up my alley in terms of what I enjoy (Tech and Communications). The prerequisites to get into the major are not hard, they consist of IST 110, 210, and 220 with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 (I have a 3.20). I have not completed any of the three prerequisite courses however I'm taking all three during my fourth semester and I will be passing them. Do any of you know if there is a policy that will not allow me to gain entrance to the college of Information Science and Technology at University Park even though I have completed all of my entrance to majors and have the cumulative GPA high enough to enter?

Very excited since Penn State is where I wanted to go, but I\\'m curious what the culture is like for graduate students on campus. 1.

How does Penn State (admin/faculty) regard there graduate students, are we well respected and treated as a student population with a voice in campus events? 4.

The projects are way over my head and I don't know if I should continue with CS here at Penn State. I've heard that the higher level CS courses make 311 look like a cakewalk, so again, I don't know if it's right for me. I wouldn't want to switch into IST because the job prospects aren't as good as a CS major. That and if I were to go into IST, I'd double major in SRA but I wouldn't graduate on time. So, that leads me to the Data Science major, I did some reading on it and honestly it sounds really interesting. From what I've heard there's a somewhat decent demand for data science grads right now. I believe I would still be able to graduate on time if I switched but I'd have to check with my advisor to see if that's true. Here's what my question is: what are the higher level Data Science courses like? I don't know if I would be able to handle the higher level CS courses, so I want to make sure I could be able to handle higher level DS courses before I switch. Are they impossibly hard? What are some of the professors like? I'm an okay programmer at best, so are the higher level DS courses programming heavy? I know it's ironic that I'm a CS major looking to stray away from programming, but again, most of it is over my head and I'm not sure what to do. If anyone has any advice for me, regarding higher level CS courses and/or higher level DS courses, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks! EDIT: I would also love to stay in Comp Sci, switching would be a worst case scenario. If anyone has any advice for me on how to tackle higher level CS courses I would also greatly appreciate that. <eos> \", \"<bos> Hi. My brother is a student at PSU, and I'm trying to get him to attend more hockey games.

Then we see a busted looking hoopty speeding away from a police cruiser. The car hit the median, ramping off of it and bottoming out, in the process getting a flat tire. They drove another few hundred yards before crossing over to the other side of the street and ditching the thing on Atherton outside of Red Lobster. It didn't appear that the cops had caught him. It actually seemed that the officer tailing him had mistaken another police cruiser in the lot of Red Lobster as the hoopty he was chasing (just in a routine stake out, watching the road for speeding, drunk driving, etc.). Honestly, at the speed he was traveling, if he had not hit the median, he would have gotten away. <eos> \", \"<bos> Hey I posted a couple months ago about simple first date ideas in the area.

On LionPath I can't remove the minor from my degree or make any changes. I talked to an advisor for my major (not my assigned advisor) during walk-in hours, and she told me that this isn't a big deal. She said I would just receive an email from my minor's department stating that I didn't complete the requirements, and then it wouldn't show up on my transcript. She pretty much said I don't have to do anything about it. But right now the minor is still listed on my graduation application, my academic requirements, and in other places on LionPath. Is this a problem if I don't complete a minor that's still showing on my degree? Or is there a way to have it removed from my degree even after I've applied for graduation? As long as I can graduate, I don't mind having an unfinished minor on my record.

We have 3 options going forward: 1. Continue to allow buying/selling threads (with users downvoting posts if they get annoying) 2. Ban buying/selling threads 3. Create a dedicated buy/selling/trading thread to contain posts. **However:** This may not be a feasible option given that there is little we can do to prevent scamming. This post has been put in contest mode to facilitate discussion. In the meantime, we can issue a moratorium on buying/selling posts. We value your input! Discuss.

Personally, I think it's a really bad time/location for a bachelor party, but its what they want and therefore its what I (my brother's best man) want!

Naturally over the course of a few weeks, whenever people got drunk in the apartment we would put more holes in the door using our fists, elbows, feet, heads, etc. Not trying to sugarcoat it, the door was pretty mangled. Last week we get a notification that they\\'re coming to inspect the apartment. My roommate got the brilliant idea of taking a flag and taping it on the door - and it worked perfectly. She even walked through the door without noticing. However, we did state that we had a couple of other problems in the apartment, including a faulty stove. ARPM then decides to surprise us the next morning with a maintenance guy, and the flag fell off the door. He sees the door and says \"Well this isn\\'t good.\" Tells my roommate that he\\'s taking the door immediately and replacing it.  When my roommate asks \"Can we just go to Home Depot and replace it ourselves?\"  \"You might have been able to beforehand but now that I\\'ve seen the door I\\'m gonna have to replace it immediately.\"  \"How much is that going to cost us?\" \"It\\'ll be $500.\" Outrageous. We checked our lease agreement and there\\'s no destruction of property clause that says they can fine whatever they want, it just says that we\\'re responsible for the costs of replacing whatever property we damage. I could probably replace 10 doors with $500. Has anyone else had to deal with this kind of bullshit? Were you able to get out of it?

Especially something that might easily make me a target (to get my ass kicked by upperclassmen or whatever). Are there any do's that I should follow? What is something that you wished you had known as an incoming freshman?  Also what good places for studying have you found? Either quiet or just nice soothing environment. And lastly, when not in class or studying, what things are there to do around campus when you're bored?  **EDIT**: Thank you so much for everyone's bit of information. There are really great tips and advice throughout here. I did *not* think that I would get so many responses.

Im a materials engineering major, a C or better isnt required for chem 110 but I dont know if I should retake it. The only reasons I would think to retake it is to do better in 112 and for future prerequisite reasons (chem 202 requires chem 110 as a prerequisite), but I feel like I would be sitting through material I already understand if I do that. I have heard from many people that chem 112 is easier than 110 and doesn't have that weed out feel. any advice as to what I should do guys?

The current rental runs out at end of July, and we think we can live with a friend for one month. I feel like we will be in a better negotiating position if we can just get to the other side of August before signing anything. Is this possible or am I just dreaming?

I am acquiring 2 associates degrees from community college: Business Administration  History. I\\'ve been thinking about getting into the IT industry and noticed Penn State offers an IST and MIS degree. I was thinking about going down the MIS route, given I already have business credits from my associates and I can get an IT job with an MIS degree. Overall, if I did go to Penn State my plan was to either get IST or MIS accompanied by their Supply Chain  Information Systems degree (Basically dual major).  For the people that took either IST, MIS, or SCIS: 1. What was your \"timeline\" outcome from getting the degree(s)? 2. What is the course work/load like in terms of what is being taught and the level of difficulty presented in the course? 3. What should my expectations be when pursing these degrees? 4. Does my plan make sense of acquiring either the an MIS or IST, partnered with a SCIS?  Feel free to provide any other information that you feel would be helpful. Thanks! **Background Info** Like mentioned before I\\'m acquiring two associate degrees from a community college. As far as professional careers go, I started out working remotely for a small but established management consulting firm doing business/market research on all companies and industries the firm followed. I later transitioned into an executive assistant-project/office manager role where I kept track of all firm operations, which included research initiatives, internal IT, as well as client communication/services. Unfortunately the firm couldn\\'t afford to pay me anymore (bankrupt), which resulted in me leaving. I did love the job and learned so much from it than I could have possibly imagined. I definitely would love to do something like that again and grow from it. I especially loved the research, analyzing and learning how companies/industries operate and what affects their business and growth. At the moment I\\'m working for a school district doing IT support and absolutely hate it. There are many management problems and bureaucratic nonsense that goes on constantly, as well as a whole list of other issues. Not to mention I\\'m part of a union which is one of the worst things I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'m currently looking for another position now in either IT or something similar to what I did before, but I would like to try and stay in IT.

I just finished the summer session so I'm returning at the end of the week. I am a CS major and I was wondering what kinds of stuff I have to do to score an internship position for next summer? I know it's really really difficult (near impossible) for a freshman to get an internship but I'm determined to do anything and everything to get one. I took a year off before starting college to build up some work experience and I already have a bit before I came here so my resume isn't totally empty. However, most of the stuff I have done aren't exactly related to a programming internship which is what I really want to get into, though I'm fine getting an IT related internship as long as it pays well. I just really need to get money saved up over next summer so that I can pay for apartment rent when I'm a sophomore and I think an internship is the best way to pay for it. However, although I do have fairly light experience in programming languages (python and C++) I haven't really done anything spectacular and I'm not really good enough to program anything to put into a portfolio. I am willing to pick up some books and study like crazy to spruce up my programming skills if necessary for an internship position next summer since I'm only taking comp sci 121 this fall which is a really easy intro python course (which I feel I already know pretty well).  Anyway here's my resume with the personal stuff taken out.

I learned that other people had received this email too, and I wanted to warn people before they use the app: The app requires notifications and locations permission, it asks you to provide your full name, and to verify your psu email. Once you sign up a message says “absolutely no objectionable content” allowed. From what I saw, the message boards are heavily moderated in order to prepare the app for being advertiser-friendly. This actually means there is very little organic content generated and it’s highly exploitative in favor of the app creators. The curated posts are offensively bland and they use :( a lot, in case you didn’t get that they disapprove of something, which you definitely will. Of course this is all my perspective (and maybe I am not the best person for this, given that I’ve mentioned other apps), but the way that this was solicited to us en masse through our university emails is at least cause for concern. <eos> ', '<bos> I am looking for a Penn State League team that wants to participate in the collegian league or has a way to get one started.

It took a strange turn tonight when in desperate need of snacks and what not, we walked to the nearest convenience store, the Diplomart. Planning on a quick in and out, we immediately were confronted by a man standing in front of the customer side of the register. He was acting as if he was part owner of the store and repeatedly asked us what we were looking to buy. On top of that he was asking where we lived, what our jobs were, etc. At this point it seemed pretty clear that he was high on something. Disclaimer: I've partaken in many fun times, with many fun things, but I couldn't peg what this guy was on. He was acting uncomfortably friendly and asking us about every item we picked out. The man at the register who I believe to be the main owner had a strange smile throughout the whole encounter. When I was going to pay, the man in front of the counter said aloud all of our items and their prices to the owner behind the register, then the two had what seemed to be a discussion about me and my friend in their native language. The way he was acting was as if he was going to pay for our items. He even took his wallet out just before telling me I can pay for it at the register, then stepped aside. To be clear, he was standing directly in front of the register the entire time. The total came out to be what looked to be right, but the whole interaction was completely purposeless. We just paid and got out of there, but we were scratching our heads for a half hour trying to understand what actually just happened.

I always use a VPN, and have never been \\'caught\\' or \\'disciplined\\' in any way. Early this January I was conducting business as usual when my internet was taken down due to Rescom detecting that my computer was \"infected\" or \"compromised\" and was part of a botnet or some shit. It was obvious to me that they were just picking up the traffic my computer receives/sends via the VPN, but I obviously couldn\\'t tell them that so I had to have my computer reformatted by them.  Since then I\\'ve done all my torrenting on my cell phone\\'s data plan, but it can be a hassle. Has anyone had any similar experiences torrenting this semester (with or without a VPN)?

I am going to be starting my SRA degree soon and was just curious about job field associated with the SRA degree with Intelligence Analysis and Modeling option. Little bit about me for reference: I am a current security contractor with an active security clearance working in the Middle East. There’s a lot of down time so finishing out here won’t be an issue. I would like to hang up the guns and vests for a “better” job pursuing something with this degree. I was wondering if me having a clearance already would help. Also what the difference between the two options means in terms of job opportunities. Any insight or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

However, I am not entirely sure because I am not sure whom I will room with and it is kind of far. If you already lived there, how'd you like it?  Is it easy to meet people and make friends there if you are new and don't know anyone there? What's the social life like at the retreat? The only problem I have is that this is my first semester at Penn State so I don't know a lot of people here. I am new here, and I haven't made a group of friends yet. I just transferred to Penn state this semester.  And also, someone told me that people there tend to keep the themselves and stay within their established friend group. So, I am afraid that if I am living in the Retreat I will be isolated from everyone else. I am having the same problem right now, on my floor everyone seems to be mostly upperclassmen and don't ever talk to each other. Because of that I am having tough time meeting people and making friends here. I am mostly by myself and honestly, it's kind of depressing.

I loved the atmosphere, the people and the idea of THON. So I took over 3 AP classes,two honors classes and joined a variety of clubs to help stand apart from the crowd and get in. Well,it happened and I got into Penn state Altoona (my #1 choice campus) and now had to deal with the next problem- affording Penn state. After A LOT of loans,we still had a **$2,000** gap,and had no option of housing due to a (literally) hundred long waiting list. My mom didn't know what to do,and advised me to look into other colleges. But I urged her to keep calling for me.and though a turn of PURE luck we got connected to Mr.Rick Shaffer,the director of admissions at Penn State Altoona. After telling him my problem he took down our information and told us he'd call us in a week. We hoped that maybe we may get a higher spot on the waiting list for housing,but instead got much more than that. Mr.Shaffer reserved a on campus dorm room just for me,waived my housing and acceptance fees,and gave me a scholarship of over **$7,000** (really for no reason,my mom didn't even tell him of our gap). My mom cried tears of joy,and I was dumbfounded this not only closed our gap,but gave me money left over for books and etc. I received this call today,and it's literally the nicest thing I can recall anyone ever doing for me.

Accusations of child abuse are enough to kill a career and are not something you should just throw around as if they hold no weight. He told his superior and also the head of campus police.

ORIGINALLY, i was supposed to attend PSU from out of state, but tuition was way too high for me because my mom refused any help with loans whatsoever. Since i was moving here for good, I decided it would just be best to not enroll in this semester and go back next year (which would hopefully help for in state tuition.) So i have a job now, state ID, lease, health insurance, switched banks, and i have my drivers exam next month and i'll be getting car insurance for that. Then i would go back in 2018, either the spring or fall semester, (most likely fall). Would it be hard for me to get my tuition lowered?

He and I are both third-semester sophomores at Penn State Harrisburg doing concurrent majors in IST and SRA. If we choose to go with the 2+2 plan, as many of you probably already know, we can go to University Park for our junior and senior years. However, we’re unsure of what to expect for a lot of what goes on up there, so we were hoping someone with experience could help us out. First, is getting good housing at UP as difficult to get as I hear? Here at PSH, it’s not difficult at all to get a [four-person off-campus apartment that’s walking distance from campus, and each of us have our own room and sink and we have two bathrooms]([url link] Are there dorms/apartments at UP like this? How difficult is it to get on-campus housing anyway? Another question of ours, how long is your commute to class, on average? Walking to class from our apartment as it stands is about a fifteen minute walk. We obviously expect a longer walking distance, but are also aware of alternative options such as public transportation. Does the time to get to class differ significantly from on to off-campus housing? In addition, are teaching assistants common at UP? They’re practically unheard of here, and I don’t know what to expect from a course with one. Maybe people just make an irrationally big deal of them for all we know. Neither of us are really into parties or sports. However, (much) more than one place to eat, facilities that were actually designed to be used as a university and not an Air Force base, better resources for our major and class selection, being with our friends that are also transferring, and more stuff to do in general is kind of drawing us there. But our biggest reasons for staying are concerns about commute time, housing, professors, and class difficulty. I realize I kind of rambled, but we would really appreciate any input anyone might have to offer. We've been mulling this over for almost a year now and are starting to run out of time.

Temple is obviously the better choice for the college experience thab Harrisberg. Although Harrisburg is looked down upon because it is not main campus, the degree says Penn State and not Harrisburg. This means the the degree you get from there is just as good and held on the same pedestal as the degree from main campus. I want to go to Temple but I have read in many places that people with the Penn State degree have an easier time finding jobs and jobs that pay more compared to Temple. Is it that some people only come to party mess up those statistics or does the degree in the same major from two different schools matter?

He is enrolled in main campus for the summer, but asked to be enrolled in the fall when he applied.

Other people have said they accepted full time job offers only to have them revoked.

I'm just helping them get the word out... which makes me the self-proclaimed head of their marketing department lol. I figured you PSU redditors would appreciate the site as it is similar to reddit. It's pretty easy to use and convenient especially if you are looking for something like easy GH/GA classes, which I have been struggling to find myself. You can also use this site to find rides home or sell books, etc.  Everything is free. All you have to do is make an account and start posting!  It would mean a lot if we could get some help from you redditors. Also we need a lot of help marketing. We like to employ guerilla marketing techniques. For example, last year we had a group of students running around throwing paper airplanes into the large lecture halls. It was pretty cool seeing like 30 paper planes flying from the top of 100 Thomas all the way to the podium at the bottom. We also had about 50 shirts made last year. We distributed them by literally walking into classes before the professor arrived, told the students who we were, and just threw the shirts at the hottest girls in the room. So the marketing side of this site is pretty fun and unique. If you'd like to join just post here.

[url link] If you don't have the time to watch, Stewart pretty much rips us apart for the Wednesday riot.

He then makes an appalling metaphor that says we were raped by the administration, but we'll recover in later years (a la the victims). We need to show Stewart photos of the real Penn State.

While the NCAA makes the claim that it \"is the oversight party of the Athletic community in which Penn State operates\", I do not believe that they have the jurisdiction to stray so far away from the field and issue these sanctions. If anything, this gives the NCAA the jurisdiction to control every on field and off field incident at just about every university that plays sports. If they don\\'t like your mascot, sanction. If they don\\'t like your fight song, sanction. This brings up the question to why Penn State accepted such harsh conditions, and the answer is publicity. If Penn State were to challenge even one of the many sanctions, they would surely look like a monster of a school still not taking the blame for past actions. 2. I believe that the punishment, while mostly deserved, was way to harsh. It\\'s one thing to punish the people involved, i.e. the one that shall not be named, Curely, Spanier, ect. but it is a totally different thing to punish an entire university for the actions of some big wigs at Old Maine... The sanctions effectively destroys the football program for decades and punishes mot only the football team but the band, cheerleaders, ect. for the actions of a single man. 3. The punishment came out way too quickly and with out proper investigations and interviews. The consensus with most people is that the Freeh Report is the straight up truth, well that file is 500 pages of circumstantial evidence with no definitive facts. While some of the information supplied could be true, more time is needed. Before such ridiculous sanctions are put out, lets first finish the trials and more importantly gather all the possible evidence before we start going out burning witches and make such rash decisions that destroys the legacy of the greatest coach ever. <eos> ', '<bos> I went there today and it was delicious, definitely going back. <eos> ', '<bos> Are there any buildings on campus where I can go onto the roof? <eos> ', '<bos> Looking for good local food, breweries, and sites.

I would like to ask the Penn Staters here on which season (Fall or Spring) offers a better experience, taking into account the events held and things to do at PSU. I know that THON is a pretty big thing at Penn State and it is held during the Spring season -- would you say it is an integral part of the Penn State experience that an exchange student shouldn't miss?  I am currently offered Fall 2017 but I still have time to change it to Spring 2018 if I want to. My other considerations are the weather conditions during the respective seasons and which offers a better scenic view while I travel.

I plan to enlist in the Air Force July 2017. I'm currently set to enroll in the world campus this upcoming summer. I needed a online program due to the fact that I'm currently nowhere near able to physically go to the school.  If I just major in SRA I can finish before the end of summer 2017. However, if I double major IST/SRA and work pretty hard I would have about 6-7 classes left to complete after summer 2017. I ideally would like to work with networks(which is what I plan to do while I'm in) and after that go the security engineer route.

Having a Big 10 team in the National Championship game will greatly improve recruiting some of the players that would never think to come to a team outside of the SEC. I'm sick of hearing about how the Big 10 isn't what it use to be, maybe teams like Ohio State can help bring us back to a top conference.

To be honest I'm very surprised with how pricey they all are. Here in Europe I'm paying $12 a month for 1GB of data, unlimited texting/calling. It's a decent plan for me as that's all the data I need a month. In SC I'd probably need some more data a month - at least 2GB - to stay connected with my family even when I'm somewhere without WiFi.  I can't do Verizon or Sprint as my phone isn't compatible with those networks. I can do ATT and T-mobile - and probably many more, just haven't looked into any others at this point. Based on some previous posts here it looks like reception can be a bit tricky in SC...and I also need to go for one of those plans you don't need credit to get, as I naturally as a foreigner have none. Looked into ATT - 2GB, $30 + access charge (wtf?) $25 = $55 a month... seriously? What? Why? How? Isn't there anything cheaper out there?

Thought it'd be a good idea to see how things have changed (or stayed the same). I'll start with a few: * Facebook didn't exist. Angel was only used by a handful of professors, and it sucked just as bad back then. * The Mezzanine (formerly the Cell Block) was The Crowbar, and they brought in half-decent music acts. * The Men's BB team had double the win % of the Football team. Yet, the Women's BB team had better attendance than the Men's BB team. * To get under the Life Sciences bridge, you had to walk thru a dimly lit tunnel of scaffolding and plywood. * Geeks and nerds mourned the loss of Playland. * The Creamery was on Shortlidge Rd, and they (still) didn't mix flavors. * A girl fell to her death in an elevator shaft in Atherton Hall after trying to climb out of a stuck elevator. * You didn't need to be on a list, show a PSU ID, or even be a PSU student to get into a frat party. * Bill Pickle's Tap Room was a ~~clothing~~ shoe store. * A drunk guy died choking on his own vomit while being held down by bouncers in Calder Alley. * THON was in Rec Hall, and it was 48 hours. * Five Guys was a Wendy's. * Joe Paterno was head football coach. MORE: * Student IDs were horizontal, included a smart card on them (for laundry), and we used our SS# for test taking. * E-mail/PSUID only had 3 numbers and didn't start with 5. * The S-Zone and the band were in the endzone. Zombie Nation wasn't that popular. White Outs didn't exist...yet.

I think I'll be choosing either Altoona or Behrend, but I'm open to changing my mind.

He's had 2 seasons at PSU: 8-4 and 7-5 , great for the circumstances PSU is in but not top caliber college football record. Plus there are many bad losses PSU had in those 2 seasons.  Houston paying his $6.5 mil buyout plus beating his $3.2 million salary for a coach who didn't even go ranked in his two season in college football seems a bit crazy to me.
