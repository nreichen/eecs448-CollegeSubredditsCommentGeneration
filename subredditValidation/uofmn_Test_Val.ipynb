            "<bos> Hey so I have just received my acceptance to attend Carlson school of management on exchange (I am from Australia) in the spring semester next year. I have the options of either middlebrook, centennial or university village for my accommodation. I am quite a social person and wouldn't mind attending regular parties etc. I was just curious as to what would be the best option of those 3 for what I am after. Also how do the meal plans and that work? Plus any further general advice I should be aware of. I want to fully immerse myself in the whole college life/atmosphere. Cheers  <eos> \n",

What are your opinions or experiences with the course, the difficulty, usefulness of knowledge (I am considering a future career in health or research), and the fairness of grading. Also, for cell biology BIOL4004 what professors did you have and what are your thoughts on the criteria I listed above. Any help would be greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Moen was one of my most beloved professors, and he was developing a new functional language called Orson on GitHub, and I was attempting to learn it. However, his profile ([@jamesbmoen]([url link] and repos now give 404's. He seems to have left around the same time that Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, but he never struck me as someone who would just up and leave without so much as a note. Does anyone know if he said anything about it? UPDATE: I sent Moen an email! Here's the relevant part of his reply:  I deleted my Github site the day after I'd heard that Github was acquired by Micro$oft [...]. They have been historically hostile to free software in general and Linux in particular, and I suspect their purchase of Github is just the latest attempt to exclude these competitors.  [...]  I haven't moved Orson yet, so it's not available online, unless someone other than me has an old copy somewhere. I looked at some sites that seem to do the same thing that Github does, but I haven't made a decision about them.  [...]  I'll probably just get a faculty website from the CSci department here at UMN and put my code up there, if that's appropriate. If I do that, then you can get it through the CSci department website. This probably won't happen until Fall semester though. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Good evening **best** subreddit in the world! I am a freshman right now (Well I did PSEO at a community college so I have a little over 100 credits after summer semester, and I'm two years from graduation (Just switching to CSCI after making a stupid first major choice)) and this year I have been living at home due to the fact that I didn't want to take out loans and I get scholarships to pay my tuition. The issue is that my mother suddenly told me she wants me to move out for fall, which means I'll need to take out that one ~$5000ish dollar loan that's offered on the FAFSA and use it to pay for housing. I'm a pretty frugal guy, and I would like insight for those who are in the know about how and if I can and should go about looking for housing, and what my cheapest option would be. I'm sure there's someone I could talk to about this on campus, but everyone on reddit seems to know a lot (I'm gullible) and I'm sure a majority of you know about how on campus housing works from a consumer's standpoint and will hopefully share your insight with me. My research so far has lead me to believe that my best bet would be to try and go with a double in Bailey or Centennial. I'm a pretty quiet, solitary guy, but I have no friends on campus, so I'm hoping I meet some people while I'm at it, but I also enjoy studying too. I also recently left a cult that was big into the no drugs/alcohol thing that I was in for awhile, so I kinda want to figure out what like \"night life\" or whatever is about but I think it might be a little freaky for me. So /r/uofmn, considering my predicament, do you have any advice for me? Do you think that this late into the gambit all hope is lost? Lol /u/OhBoyImScrewed go fuck yourself, find a gay sugar daddy instead? I'm sorry if a post like this is against the rules, but since I just have begun thinking about this so late I thought I could make my own post because I genuinely would like some advice. I have read though the housing information threads on here and stuff, so no need to repeat information that's there.  Thank ya'! Tl;dr: I have never thought of living on campus until today, and now I don't have little pamphlets and orientations to hold my hand, so now I need reddit to give me a slap in the face.  <eos> \n",

Does anyone know if there are payment plans for big technology purchases? Or if it's charged to my student account would it have to be paid in full by the end of this semester? I could pay some monthly until I get spring semester tuition and then I could pay the rest off. I'm working 40 hours/week and taking 16 credits, I'm desperate for a computer that just works, I waste so much time trying to get my computer to cooperate. Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm currently a freshman at the University of Minnesota. So a couple friends and I (four people) were planning on living in a 2 bedroom apartment next year. However, we decided not to live with them next year and found two different people to live with.  They had done all the planning and such, so I guess I'm kind of panicking about my living situation for next year. I would appreciate any sort of advice on: -Where to live (location wise - I would prefer near a light rail or bus stop - just so I could get to West Bank easily but it's not a huge deal, I enjoy walking across the bridge and also plan on getting a bike next year) -Reasonable price ranges (we are thinking about $600-750 range) -Whether or not I am screwed by not having a place this late -We kind of want a 4-bedroom place, but 2-bedrooms isn't out of the question either. -management! -anything else that you feel is important  Thanks so much in advance!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello everyone, I am a 23 year old masters student from the Netherlands. I am currently making the last arrangement for my internship in Minneapolis at the Masonic cancer institute. I am starting there coming May and am currently looking for housing. As I will be arriving there shortly before the start of my internship I have no oppurtunity to explore the housing opportunities myself. I will be staying in Minneapolis for 6 months, the current plan is from 03-07-2016 up until 09-06-2016. As I am coming from the Netherlands I will require furnishing to be present. What are my best options for housing during my stay? As in dorm or non-dorm housing, and which location. Thank you for any help and tips. <eos> \n",

But does that include the courses at Institute of Technology? Because I don't see why say Electrical Engineering or Physics wouldn't be part of CSE :D Googling didn't really help...

Easiness and low time commitment are definitely the priorities. Fun and interesting would be a nice bonus, but overall I'm just trying to spend as little time as possible on that extra credit, so I can focus in on my big classes. Open to online options, if anyone has experience there. Thanks a ton! EDIT: Thanks for the input. Fairly set on either PUBH 1001: Success Over Stress, or PUBH 1005: Sleep, Eat, and Exercise. Anyone else have experience with these? Any reason to take one over the other? <eos> \n",

I'd really like to avoid this in the '16-'17 schoolyear, but my friends are getting a place in Dinkytown which looks like it would be even worse than my current situation. Does anyone have experience living in places with soundproof walls  quiet neighbors that they would recommend? Also, what's the best way to find quiet roommates?

However, we reached a point int he development where it is essential for us to have a programmer or someone who can program the app. So, if you are a computer science major at the U of M that is a Junior or Senior or someone who has some interest and knowledge in programming apps (or willing to learn it soon), please send us a message or post here!

We have a midterm coming up in a week or so, and I'm just confused, It's not that I'm stupid or anything considering I'm doing really well in my calc 2 class, our lecture is 3 hours and our professor just says a lot of things but when attempting to do HW, is almost completely irrelevant, I cant learn like this. so a few questions for those who have taken microecon 1). Is there someplace or someway I can a list of equations to know for the midterm 2)is there a list of concepts I should know to prepare for the midterm (I'm going to read through all the chapters since the lectures have been no help at all). Also 3)Are there graphs on the exam like on the HW, in other words is the exams like the HW? <eos> \n",

I'm interested in chemistry and sustainable polymers, but I'm open to other areas within my major. I'm a freshman (will be a sophomore in the fall), and this will be my first time at a research lab ever. I have not zeroed in on what exact research area to focus on, and I'm willing to apply broadly and experiment over the summer to find what I truly like. Is it too late to find a research mentor? I will be emailing professors over the next week. What kind of position can I expect to get? Also, I have an undergraduate research scholarship (URS), so funding wouldn't be a problem. Given that I haven't taken any serious coursework in my major (chemE and chemistry double major), will I be considered seriously? I'm also interested in bio related applications of engineering, so anything within the biomedical engineering department or CBS is also an option. <eos> \n",

Do I leave after they take attendance if it stays full or stay the whole time? Anyone else who has done this, please help me out! It seems so weird :P <eos> \n",

Myself and a subset of the Rocket Team here at the U are currently working on a rocket for an upcoming competition next fall. We have (and will continue to) been capturing pictures and video of our stages of progress, including test launches.  Next fall, we need to submit a video containing this content for judges to score. Scoring relies heavily both on the rocket itself, but also in the quality of the video. The video should be a promotional/hype type of video, so it should be a fun project to work on!

I have used it at the obvious places: the Coffman restaurants, the convenience stores, and coffee shops; but the prices there are all definitely jacked up to some extent and the restaurants are hardly ever open at a time where my meal plan cannot provide the same thing (to some extent). Does anybody know of any super hidden secrets where I can spend all of this useless currency to salvage as much value as I can? From my experience, I've probably gotten the most satisfaction out of Papa Johns but that's about it, and it's only because it was open late. Anything else would be peachy. <eos> \n",

One of which is at the same time as a required comp sci class that only has one lecture time, so that time period is out of the question. The second time has 4 open spots left and I don't get to register until 3:25 pm tomorrow (the 25th). So my question is what are permission codes? and if the class that I need to take is filled how should I go about trying to get one? Should I email the professor and explain my situation or is there a different way? How likely am I to get a permision code? Thanks for any answers and sorry for the wall of text. <eos> \n",

One review said that if you miss one small thing in your report, you automatically fail.  I'm assuming that a lot of these reviews are exaggerating (after all it is RateMyProfessor, where pissed students go when they have a bone to pick)... so I am hoping to hear from some U of M redditors who will better describe what their experiences with this laboratory course was like.  How is the workload? Is the grading system fair (i.e. did you ever feel cheated or completely jaded by this class)? Any advice/thoughts/potential warnings are much appreciated! <eos> \n",

So I recently got denied an apartment because of my criminal history check. I have a misdemeanor on my record which I am in the process of getting expunged. The attorney that I'm working with told me he's almost certain he could get it expunged given that it was 10 years ago, no crimes since, me getting my education (A.A.S and now starting at the U as a transfer student), and me being a parent but said the process could take up to 6 months. I am in a scholarship program that pays my rent up to 1000$ a month and the security deposit. I have been renting now at two different places for the past 5 years on good terms as well. It would be only me living there, my kids are staying with their mother while I go to school.

None of the admissions people seemed to know anything about the anthro department and only a couple of them knew where it was.

All I have is weird 1-2 hour blocks. Should I change my schedule or are the profs flexible enough to let me work evenings? I don't want my schedule to prevent me from doing productive research, with actual progress by the end of the school year. This is my first time doing formal research, and I hope to achieve something tangible (I know this sounds extreme), but all I want is for my research to be meaningful, rather than being made to assist in a lab cleaning dishes (no offense intended on people whose first lab job was cleaning dishes. Also I'm not sure if all labs make you do such work in the beginning before giving you more responsibility?) (I'm a sophomore planning to be in chemical engineering.) <eos> \n",

I really liked the campus and the surrounding areas, and I like the fact that there are Big 10 athletics (especially hockey). However, I am nervous about what daily student life is like at The U. I have heard bad things about the campus food (that it gets boring, that there is a lack of healthy options), and I am worried that there is nothing to do during the winter months. As a student, can someone either confirm or dispute this? How is the food? How is the greek life? And what is there to do to stay active and entertained? <eos> \n",

The campus rec center looks awesome and like there would be tons of other people my age, similar to the gym at my school. I talked to them today and they only give out memberships to students though, and I'm only here for my internship; not to take summer classes. Do you think it would work if one of my roommates (who goes to UofMN) bought a membership and gave me his card? Or would that be cheating the system? I would be willing to pay any fee to get in but they seemed really stubborn about it... anyways I was wondering if somebody could tell me the options I have.

            "<bos> Hey people, I am searching around the internet(mostly cragislist) for housing options. I thought moving back home for my last year was a great way to save some money, relax, etc.  Long story short, the 2-3k I would save in a year is not worth the trouble for me. In the long run it isn't that much money, especially when a career is to be had.  So I am looking for ideas of places I can live. I don't really care how nice it is, or really where it is(b/w 5-10 miles from MPLS campus is my max). I just want a room with enough room for a bed and a desk. I would like the rent to be &lt;$350 or so.  So where do you guys suggest? My ideal situation would a co-op where I would more or less, work for my stay. EDIT: thanks for all your help guys. I managed to find a room for $350, and I found out about some awesome coops that I applied for. <eos> \n",

I’m curious if anyone has any details about the store and why they moved into the building across the street.

            "<bos> Im a Sophomore right now finishing my 4th semester, in CLA with intended major being BA Comp Sci Since I didnt come in with many prereqs as a freshman Im applying for my major Fall semester next year. I am a bit worried however, because my tech gpa is going to come in around 2.8, plus im already applying late. Im trying my best to graduate in 4 years, but with a tech gpa like that am I just screwed if I dont get in since Im applying so late? If not, how do classes beyond these I am taking right now affect my tech gpa? Will it still be possible to raise it? Just confused on how some of this works. EDIT: Also just occurred to me that I'm applying for the major while I'm taking CSci 2021, so I'll have a chance to boost it up some more. Most of my Tech GPA being low was caused by Calc, so I'm gonna try my best with the time I have left in Calc 2 and 1913 (which has been easy) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I have lived in other countries and other American cities, and I have never seen so many people being so disgustingly inconsiderate on buses. Maybe one or two uneducated, drunk, crazy people, but not half a bus of college students. First day I take a bus at UMN, practically everybody had his or her feet over the free seat on front. Is this a Minnesota thing? Is it because so many students are not used to take public transportation? I really don´t get it.  <eos> \n",

I will take pretty much anything and I'll get along with anyone, really.  If anyone is also looking for a roommate it would be great to let me know. If anyone has any suggestions for the best way to find somewhere to live/roommate, that would also be very helpful. I'm currently not having a lot of luck and I'm out of the country and that's making it even more difficult.  <eos> \n",

Looking for someone who was either walking or also biking at the time of the crash. I would really value having your perspective for the story!

            "<bos> I’m transferring into the U starting this semester as a sophomore. My roommate is also transferring here, so we decided to get an off campus cheap apartment right near some people we know. I didn’t tell my parents about my living situation until I left, and they were completely furious about it. They want me to go move into a dorm before classes start. I haven’t signed the apartment lease yet, but I’m assuming the dorms are finalized. If I don’t move out of the apartment, they’re threatening to drop me off of everything (family relations, financial assistance, health insurance, taking and selling my car, etc). Any advice on what I should do? I would also hate to leave my roommate in a bad situation also. I chose an apartment for the financial reasons, but they don’t seem to care about that. I would hate to cut ties with my family, but I also want to do what’s best for me.  <eos> \n",

I've been climbing at the various VE locations for most of my life, but plan on climbing more at the U gym once on campus.

            "<bos> This folder has pictures of actual tests from my physics and CSCI 1933 Class. Note that many professors have different tests and although they technically cover the same topics they tend to differ in how the questions are asked. They're better used for general understanding. Also some of them ARE NOT CORRECT as you can see by the score on the page, or I just don't have the answers. I'm not that organized, sorry. But overall I got a B+ in the course with an overall B- average for the class. Hopefully you will be able to pull some useful tips to solve problems and get a better understanding of phyiscs [Edit] Added my CSE MATH 1371  1372 with Chester Miracle to the dropbox. If you take Calc 1 or 2 with somebody other than Chester Miracle I've heard the tests and problems are wildly different, but if you have it with Chester Miracle then the test will be 95% similar with the same type of problems, just different numbers.

            "<bos> So I posted to Craig's List, but I feel like I might have better luck on this sub. Long story short, my roommates and I have lived in our house about a month and two of us have small cars and one doesn't have one at all. We still need a lot of furniture to fill the empty spaces, but we don't have the room to move it and we can't get a trailer or truck.  So, I am wondering if anyone has old furniture or a TV (must have HDMI hookup) that they would be able to drop off. I promise we are not creepy or anything, we just really don't have any better options at this point.  We are especially looking for chairs or recliners, a coffee table, and a decent size TV with HDMI hookup. We can pay you cash if you'd like as well.  Please comment or message me if you have any serious offers. Thanks much!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So the university made an error when they charged me for the semester which made me believe I needed less loans than I actually do and now that they fixed their error I am currently about $2000 short for the entire year. I didn't accept the full amount of a Parent PLUS loan for this reason but I/my parent already submitted the loan application. So my question is, is it possible for me to request that I get the $2000 of the parent loan I previously turned down? I am definitely going to contact the financial aid office as soon as I can but if anyone has input that would be great. Thanks <eos> \n",

Any insight is much appreciated for my peace of mind. <eos> \n",

I have two roommates right now, but one of them is planning on moving out in less than a week and we desperately need to find someone to sublease. We had someone that was planning on moving in, but unfortunately she bailed on us a few days ago.  Unfortunately the roommate will need to be a female. Sorry guys, it's a strange rule my landlord has.  Anyway, please message me if you are interested or know anyone who may be! I can give you more info on what the house and my roommate and I are like, and if you would like to you could come take a look. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm kind of worried about a few things next semester, and I was hoping someone could help ease my worries for the summer. The first question I have is about financial aid. I filled out my FAFSA a few months ago, and am mildly worried about the financial aid status on MyU showing that \"Step 2: To\\-Do Items\" is not completed yet. What could I be missing/am I missing anything at all? Second, when I go to the Degree Progress page of MyU, it shows that I have 11 credits \"in\\-progress\" rather than 16, which I have registered for. Since 5 credits are missing, I'm guessing it is excluding the Japanese language class that I registered for. Should I be worried about that?  <eos> \n",

This is one of the busiest intersections on campus, especially during an event, so I realize that statistically, this would be the place where most accidents occur. Just about every accident that has happened here was due to a car trying to turn left onto Fulton, after getting off the 94 exit, then getting t-boned by another vehicle trying to get on 94. So far this week there has been three accidents, and I actually witnessed a hit and run a few weeks ago. So everyone driving, please be cautious on Huron and Fulton! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So here's my quandary: I'm trying to locate a copy the tapes of the \"nine-hour confrontation,\" as Rogers put it, between psychologists Carl R. Rogers and B.F. Skinner at the University of Minnesota in Duluth. Specifically, the discussion mentioned in Rogers's 1974 article *In retrospect: Forty-six years* on page 118. The only information Rogers gives is that it was at U of M, Duluth and that it was taped. So far the Internet has only been able to tell me that the library at Stanford has U of M dialogues from 1976, two years after the publication of the article. I don't care what medium they're on, I'm just looking for the recordings. If anyone can help, or if anyone knows anyone who could help, I'd greatly appreciate it. <eos> \n",

Their prices ranged from $9/hr to $850. You can read about everyone else on this thread. ---  I'm being totally serious. My parents and sister are coming to visit. In highschool they always made fun of me for not being able to hold down a steady relationship. I started dating a guy here welcome week and two weeks ago he cheated on me with 4 different girls (in one night.) I haven't told any of them and they still think I have a boyfriend. If anyone wants to pretend to be my boyfriend of a couple of months on Sunday, awesome. I'm willing to pay. Qualifications: You must be sociable and good at high-pressure situations. You must be generally attractive. Not a model, but above average. At least 6' tall, slender build preferred.

I was just wondering about all other transfer students who do here: How was your transfer experience? Socially, was it easy to make friends? Academically, how difficult was your new course load compared to your former college? How was orientation? How would you rate your first year overall? Thanks for any who respond!!

They said they prayed that they would find someone wearing a red scarf, and apparently that entitled me to a prayer of my choice. When I declined, they informed me that I am blessed, and they still like my outfit. I really don't know what just happened. It was weird. Just sharing my experience.

            "<bos> Hello everyone! I am a new transfer student accepted to the U of M College of Science and Engineering. I will be attending this Fall. I am in a dilemma with housing. Back in January after I got my acceptance letter, I payed my enrollment fee and applied for housing. I applied to the CSE Transfer house as my first choice. My problem is that I could either dorm or drive from home. Pros of going from home: - Dont live too far from my home (20-35 min drive) -Save money from buying housing/meal plans(big one since I have to pay for school mostly on my own.) Pros of living on campus: - New experience - Help in adjusting to campus culture - Might make it easier to meet new people and make new friends(big one since I am very shy and have trouble making new connections) I really am having a tough time deciding. I found out I got a $3750 scholarship for two years, which helps a lot, but still makes the decision tough. Can anyone give me any advice as to what they would do in my situation? Do you think it would be worth it to dorm? I know for a fact that if I do dorm, I will definitely have to make an effort to meet new people (join a club, go to events, etc.) Any advice is much appreciated. <eos> \n",

Anyways, I was wondering if as a freshmen, I should include stuff from high school or take all of that off. On another note, for textbooks, I may not need them for all my classes. My class's Facebook group is saying to ask the profs on the first day of classes. However, this seems like a bad idea to me, as there will suddenly be hundreds of students looking for the same book that I am looking for. Do you guys think it would be appropriate to email the professor about a week before asking about textbooks or would this just annoy them? <eos> \n",

I feel like people has their\u001b own clique and it is really hard to break through the bubble to join and being a friend. I think my problem is I am very quiet, socially awkward and doesn't know how to talk with ppl. Moreover, I am not from MN, so I don't have anything in common with ppl around here to say, so it is hard for me to talk about something. I know this question may be asking a lots times, but I am still can figure out the solution for me. I am joining some clubs but after meeting, nothing really happens. (Maybe I am too quiet during the meeting?) So anyone has any ideas for me? Cause this very sucks, every weekend I feel bad about myself and looking ppl having fun in Dinkytown make me more depressed. School is hard and sometimes I need someone to hang out and release stress.  About me: asian, EE major and playing LoL. <eos> \n",

I'm currently a senior (well, summer) at the College of William and Mary with the following: * 3.18 GPA :( * probably a very good GRE (I scored a 166/155 on diagnostic before studying), so I'm hoping for cumulative 320/330s * Some computer science research experience with a professor (and also quite a lot in high school if that means anything) * I'm pretty good at writing, so probably a pretty decent letter I know that my GPA is pretty low, but do you think I have any chance of getting in? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, incoming freshman here. Like many of you, I got my housing info today. I was placed in an expanded housing room (one of the study lounges) in Comstock with three other guys. I'm rather confused as to how the expanded housing program works. Is it just a temporary assignment until people move out during the year? Are you able to move out? Are the rooms even fit to have 4 guys living in them? Anybody had to live in expanded housing? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm curious to get people's inputs on why they chose a house or apartment. It seems to me like there are generally two options for me: 1) House = low rent, no furniture, your own room, generally a 10-15 bus ride away from campus  2) (Near campus) Apartment = higher rent since there are few options that aren't \"luxury\", shared room, furniture For those of you who chose a house, I'm curious - do you feel a sense of community at all? I always hear that the places with houses are generally all students, but what does that really mean for you? Do you like see your next door neighbors at all? Is it possible to have to deal with loud house parties a lot or is that not really something you notice? Does the 10-15ish minute bus ride ever get annoying to you?  And lastly, this may seem kinda ignorant, but just since the houses are generally farther away, I'm curious if you still really feel like you're in college? I'm a freshman, so it's hard to imagine what it's like coming back to an \"isolated\" house with just my roommates every night and then just going to classes and my job during the day. I'm kind of afraid of feeling too separated from college if I opt to do the house, though that seems to be the smarter financial option for me. Any thoughts?  I also don't know anyone super well, I'd probably end up rooming with someone from one of those Facebook listings. If I did a house, I'm a little afraid of feeling \"trapped\" with 5 or 6 other people for the whole year as opposed to potentially doing an apartment where at least I might meet other people in the same building? Or is that not really a good assumption to make? And of course then I'd be sharing a room with someone I don't know, but it's not like I've never done that before. Basically just ranting my thoughts on here to see if any kind hearts have any input to share.  ALSO: Do any out-of-staters have advice on how to get furniture for the school year??  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I'm pretty worried about getting in, I heard CSE has like a 8% acceptance rate. I'm hoping to get as near to a 30 on ACT as possible. Do I have a decent chance of getting in?  Edit: Just to add I passed APUSH last year, and I'm currently in AP Gov and AP Chem, so by graduation hopefully I'll have 4-6 AP credits.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Campus elections are this week! Polls are open Wed, 4/2 till Fri, 4/4. Vote online at vote.umn.edu. And here's my plug: I'm supporting Joelle Stangler and John Reichl for MSA President and Vice President. These two are the most qualified people there are for the position. They both have extensive experience working with campus administrators and the Board of Regents, and they have a great platform that covers tuition, financial literacy, sexual assault awareness, transportation, and more. Even better: they have the ambition to get it done. You can find their full platform, as well as a place to submit your concerns, at jjformsa.com. So why not their competitors? The other pair on the ticket is made up of two newcomers to campus - Abdisamed Awed and Miguel Morales. These two have a little political experience, but NOWHERE near the same clout and reputation among the administration as their competitors. Awed and Morales would be at a disadvantage when trying to get things done, and if they win, MSA will lose a lot of power it has built over the last few years through extensive lobbying. They also have a severely underdeveloped platform and have been unclear on a number of issues, or provided very general answers. TL;DR Vote Joelle and John for MSA, because they know what they're doing (find their platform at jjformsa.com).  Their competitors don't even have a website for me to link (please, someone prove me wrong, but I really haven't been able to find one). <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, the titles pretty self-explanatory, I'm a transfer student coming in from Saint John's this spring and I really want a Classy, Clean, Modern 1BR/1BA apartment, preferably somewhere close to campus. The reason for the single is not because I am some social hermit, it's because my girlfriend lives nearby and will most likely be visiting me frequently. Which would just be less complicated with no roommates. Also, that I'm a clean freak and it drives me crazy when roommates mess up/dirty things.  So far I've tried FloCo, 412 Lofts, Stadium View, Dinkydome  Solhaus. All of which are either full or don't offer singles. So I'm wondering if you guys can help? Point me in the right direction? It would be greatly appreciated!  <eos> \n",

Is the first one just online? They're the same price. How do I learn who my profs are too?

And whenever I'm in here, there's a periodic beep that lasts several seconds and then goes away. I have not timed how long it lasts, or the time between beeps, but neither one seems to have any regularity. Can someone please explain to me why this does what it does?? It's slowly driving me crazy! Edit: Asked a physics professor who lectures here, and he told me that it's because of the two clocks in the room. The beeping has something to do with them synchronizing with each other.  <eos> \n",

I’m from a small town in Wisconsin and I’m really looking forward to life in the twin cities. I love to run. I do cross country and track, and I’m going to join the running club. Other things I like to do include skiing, going to concerts (I like alt rock and indie pop) and some occasional gaming (mainly Civ 5). I’m kinda introverted and I’m not much of a partner. As for dorms, I think I’d like to be in Comstock. Send me a PM if you’re interested. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Since I know a lot of Freshmen are going to be living in a residence hall this year which have a lot of stigmas: I just finished up two years of being a Community Advisor (An RA/Person who will be watching over the floor you live on) and can pretty much answer any questions about when it comes to Housing and the various attitudes of CAs, especially in terms of alcohol, pranks, hallway activities, and drugs. More or less, there's a lot of loopholes within policy and incredibly easy tricks to avoid getting into trouble. I'll gladly answer any specific questions you have in terms of policy, dorm life, and sticking under the radar. Spoiler Alert: There's very little power CAs have and there's very rarely a situation you'll be kicked out of the dorm. I had a guy who got arrested for a drug issue (not talking just smoking a joint, bigger) and he managed to stay in housing. And remember, your CA is probably brand new at the job, has only been in training for less than 2 weeks, is human, and guaranteed has no clue what they're really doing. We always tended to overlook those residents who treated us nicely and probably gave them a free ride for the year if they didn't screw up too badly.  <eos> \n",

Luckily it hasn't cost me too much yet, but it is still something that is frustrating to deal with.  I know it clearly says on the key (For Resident Hall Students) that duplication is prohibited, but is it possible or even remotely allowed to go an duplicate a key for a case like this?

            "<bos> Hey all, as the title said I'm applying to the U for fall 2017 after being out of college since 2010. I'm a resident of Minneapolis and have been for a couple years now (from WI originally). I really prefer the city/region of Duluth to the Twin Cities, and I'd love to live up there while I'm in school. However, I'm confident that I'll be accepted to the U and, since I'm looking at computer or chemical engineering as a major, I really don't want to sell myself short of education, intern/research opportunities, grad school prep, etc. by going to UMD. I only say this because it sounds as though nothing much can really compare to the TC campus in terms of those things. Cost is not an issue because I have the GI Bill. I'd like to figure this out without asking faculty from either campus because I feel like they will give me a biased answer. I know the curriculum of both schools is almost identical on paper and that they're both part of the same \"school,\" but how true is that really? Should I go to UMD instead just because I like the city better? Will I regret that for the rest of my career? <eos> \n",

Ideally I would like a job in a library but I do not have work study. Thanks for any replies! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just transferred here this past spring semester and lived in Dinkytown. I found that transferring mid year was quite...isolating socially. I've never had the first year \"dorm experience\" or have any fun bonding moments. But now, I am commuting from home and even on a tighter schedule than before or I'll end up missing the bus home.  I'm a good student academically, but when it comes to the ability to make friends, it's really difficult for me considering I am much more of an introvert. I think I come off as boring or unapproachable to most people (I'm weary and hesitant to share too much about myself). I have an on campus job and get along with my coworkers well. In group projects, I do well. But I never make it past the point of just acquaintances. I occasionally pop into the Queer Student Cultural Center, but I found that I don't exactly mesh well in there.  Is there anything I can do about this? In such a big school, I feel so alone and isolated. Any tips would help.  <eos> \n",

I've heard mixed opinions about the difficulty of the 2011 final (I was hoping it'd be the same as the weekly quizzes) and at this point I'm not sure what to expect. A couple of weeks ago I saw many redditors were familiar with him. Does anyone know what his finals are like?

I entered the contract lottery for parking and got accepted to the Minnesota Lot in the east bank, and I'm unsure whether I should accept or decline it.  Any other recommendations for a fellow commuter student? Another thing I should note is that all of my classes are held in the east bank. The campus is a bit nerve-racking for me ATM.

I kinda f-ed up by not applying earlier, so im really scared im not gonna get my decision until like the end of March. Would that be too late?

            "<bos> Hi. I'm looking and have been applying to some work study jobs. I'm wondering if anyone knows how necessary a cover letter is? Does it depend on the job? Do I hurt my chances by not having one? I have a resume but it's very plain- a bulleted list of previous experiences and the skills I learned from them/responsibilities. I've applied to a couple and have only heard back from one, which was to say they chose not to extend an interview.  Also, will more jobs be posted closer to the school year/during? My financial aid relies pretty heavily on work study and I don't have any way to cover the cost if I don't find a job, but the selection seems to be pretty slim. Thank you!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> My roomates[25M, 21F, 20M, 21?M] and I [19F] have a room in our future house that is available to rent . It is a 6 bedroom house - 3 large bedrooms on each level - and each floor has a full bath. The house is located north of University Ave right off of Raymond - from visiting the area, the neighborhood seems nice. There is a washer and dryer on site and quite a bit of storage space. Rent is $333/month and we would ask that you place the same amount down for the deposit. The landlord has said in the past the utility expenses have been around $270/ month in total. There is a no smoking policy and a strict pet policy.  My roommates and I are relatively quiet people and are looking for someone who is relaxed and easy to live with. We are all either in school, working full time, or just getting back from basic training.  Here is a webpage posted by the landlord with pictures and a video walkthrough of the home. Please feel free to message me with any questions. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Title should explain it. Big chains (Pizza Hut/Domino's) don't count. Here are some reviews of the places that I've been to: **Punch Pizza:** My current favorite. Perfect portion size, plus their stuff is just straight up delicious. Soft  chewy crust, pretty traditional-style pizza cooked in a wood oven. Topping selection is solid too. Only gripe is that the cheese/oils/sauce are kind of slick and tend to run off the pizza if you hold it wrong. I opt to hold the slice folded in half, like a pizza taco. Verdict: 8.5/10 **Mesa Pizza:** Decent when sober, fucking incredible when wasted. Can be great sober if you order an entire pie instead of the \"by-the-slice\" option, since the slices tend to get left out for a while. Also, the Mac n Cheese pizza is usually lauded there. I thought it was underwhelming, but I was also sober when I had that, so your mileage may vary. Verdict: 4.5/10 w/ no alcohol  single slice, 7.5/10 w/ no alcohol  whole pie, 9.5/10 w/ alcohol **Blaze Pizza:** A relative newcomer to campus. Haven't had a fresh one here yet, but there is a franchise in my home town that I ate at. It was pretty damn good, about as tasty as Punch but with a more average feel to it (not the super traditional old-style pizza). Especially good if you get a dash of sea salt on it. You'll thank me later. Verdict: 8/10 **Pizza Luce:** Pretty good. Pizzas are solid; middle of the road crust, pretty great variety of pies, all-around pretty tasty. They're pricy though. Just avoid the cheesy garlic toast, gave me the shits last time. It's a great place to go out to eat if you have family in town that offer to pay for it. Verdict: 9/10 if you're not paying for it, 6/10 if you are. Share your experiences! <eos> \n",

That's stress that I don't want to deal with. Does anyone know of anyway to get a reduced price from the bookstore? Do they price match or have any coupon codes or discounts? I'm planning on ordering a Surface Pro 3, and it would be nice to avoid paying full retail price. Would it be worth calling? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Realizing that my plan was to go undecided into CLA,(I got accepted there to be a 2016 incoming Freshman in October), I emailed admissions and asked them to change my application to College of Design majoring in Graphic Design. My logic here would be that: if I decided later in my career at U of M that I wanted to do graphic design, transferring into the 4-year program would be much more difficult than transferring out of it and into CLA. I figured if I transferred out of CDes into CLA, I would have already taken my lib ed requirements and maybe some additional art classes that could be applied towards my new major in CLA. Was this wise? Should I cancel this re-application into College of Design, and just stick with CLA until I am sure I want to go into graphic design? (If I don't get into CDes I would still be able to go to CLA, regardless.) <eos> \n",

Now it looks like he might actually be living in the dorms and the idea suddenly looks less enticing. Does anyone need a 4-6 month subleaser for fall semester (i.e. going abroad)? I figured I should ask this first before I look into securing a yearlong lease of my own and deal with finding someone to take over the second half (I am pretty dead set on moving away from MN upon completion of college).

I also can't get onto the VPN, but I can't tell if it's because I'm doing it wrong or because alumni access is blocked. It would definitely be a reasonable restriction, but the policies are completely opaque. I have active access to the computer science VPN, but apparently this is not sufficient for getting onto moodle. Anybody have any ideas for getting this to work?

Is that true? What do frats do? Do you make the initiates do satanic rituals (which frat is that) also, I know there are no keggers involved, but are there sex cults? I heard that GW bush went to a frat, so you must get really good connections. I would like to get to know your ladies. I always bike past (work at chipotle in stadium village). Also, I am partially trolling, but if you would tell me about how to get into a frat and if there are frats on the st. paul campus, I would love you forever. thanks.  <eos> \n",

I'm asking honestly. It's not like reddit invented memes. It's not like advice animals and such are really all that sacred. It's the internet, and it makes people laugh, so why not let them have fun with it? Personally, it's really annoying when everyone keeps saying \"You don't know memes! I knew them first!\" Yes, you know the internet. Cool. So does everybody else. You weren't the first one to trololol on 4chan. I just don't get where the hipster rage comes from. tl;dr let them enjoy it. Be nice.

I'm truly trying to understand this. **EDIT2**: So it seems as though most of the hate I've picked up on is from a select few. I just overheard students/classmates of mine being really negative towards everything/everyone involved. I think you all have helped me see that the majority just doesn't care and chooses to just ignore it. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Sorry, it's just that I've been looking online for a due date but I'm only finding the fees to apply and I can't get a hold of housings' billing office. So I came here. Is it added to the tuition? Do I get some sort of letter? I just really need to know because my aunt might pay which is awesome and sweet. However the longer I have to wait to pay, the more likely and longer she could hold against me. It's complicated to keep it simple <eos> \n",

Google maps can't quite provide me with the insight current students may have, so any info on nearest/best (as in best value, customer service, overall cleanliness, etc.) grocery stores would be appreciated! In addition, what are your thoughts on purchasing a U-Pass? I understand getting around campus is free with the campus shuttles, but is a U-Pass worth it for off-campus excursions? How often do you use it, and is it more valuable to have that as opposed to purchasing a fare for each individual ride? Thanks! <eos> \n",

Right now, I've narrowed down my choices to several options: * 2 BR 2 Bath at The Venue, with a roommate that I think I click really well with. * 4 BR 4 Bath at The Marshall, with three others that I don't really know.  I am from out of state and won't be able to tour any of these places. My three most important criteria are:  * proximity to grocery stores * proximity to east bank campus * integrity of management The cost is not a concern to me. Can anyone give me some feedback on these three places? What you liked or didn't like? What you've heard? In particular, I'm struggling to identify which place has a better management; I really want to go with The Venue but I have not been able to identify positive reviews about it and the Marshall seems to have more feedback.

            "<bos> So I was accepted CLA early action my senior year of high school, around Christmas 2016, at the time with 3.6 weighted and 32 ACT. I badly fucked up my spring semester with PSEO courses and ended up getting A, C+ in AP Chem and World Affairs respectively at my suburban Minnesota public high school and then at RCTC D, F, F in 3 general ed courses. The people from the U I talked to as they rescinded my offer of admission were hopeful about my chances to transfer fairly quickly as I had completed 28 credits at RCTC in high school. I've spent a semester and a half at Minnesota State Mankato. First semester was a little rough not going to lie, between adjusting to life and Mankato as a party school. C+ in Philosophy 101, B+ in 4-credit History 250, D in Calc 1. This semester is going great now, with grades that after midterms look like I'll very likely finish with 29 post-HS credits, 57 overall credits: A - Health 101 3cr A - Health 240 3cr A - Sociology 294 3cr A - Urban Studies 150 3cr A- - Human Performance 330 1cr B - Chemistry 111 5cr These are also my current grades immediately after midterms. My extracurricular involvement includes pledging a fraternity fall semester (I dropped right before initiation when I decided to transfer and I've been accepted to Iowa State), a leadership position in Sociology Club, volunteering in setup and refereeing with Anthony Ford Pond Hockey charity tournament and Rake the Town and Rochester Festival of Trees, work experience of 2 years with Caribou Coffee, as well as attending the Midwestern Sociological Society annual conference in Minneapolis. I can get a shining letter of recommendation from one of the upper division sociology professors at Mankato. My responses to the essay questions will also be extremely strong, I got a perfect ACT writing score. My stats broken down a variety of ways would be 3.04 MSU GPA at the end of spring semester/if midterm grades are used (2.21 fall semester) 2.78 cumulative college GPA 57 credits, after this spring semester (2.47 with just fall semester 2017/39 credits overall) 32 ACT (not sure if that'll factor in) 3.2 overall HS GPA How likely is it that I get admitted to CLA for Fall '18 as a sociology major now or at the end of this semester? Should I wait until spring semester ends ~May 4 to send in my application, or ask them to consider my midterm grades?  <eos> \n",

The Formula SAE team is a student group that designs, builds, and races a formula-style race car every year in a competition which includes more than a hundred schools from around the world. The team is looking for members of all majors, including mechanical, electrical, and aerospace engineering.

Team experience looks great on a resume, and there are many oppourtunities to network across a number of industries.

Hope to see a lot of you there! <eos> \n",

We have a cat and two chinchillas, but the chinchillas will be in my bedroom.  Roomate can't be a clean-freak, because our apartment now gets fairly messy. We're weird, so we do and say weird things at times. We're basically just looking for someone who's pretty laid back. Rent is super cheap, it's 980 a month plus heat and electricity split between three people. I don't have exact sizing, but the bedrooms are really big, there's a small living room upstairs and a den in the basement. There's only one bathroom that is pretty small, but the kitchen is really nice and there's a big yard. If interested, let me know. Reply to the post and I can give you my information to discuss things further.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Wondering if anybody would like to describe their experiences with asl.  I'm currently taking spanish and really struggling with it. I think it's totally possible to pass it as of now but I just don't enjoy learning the language, and am worried about how I'll do in the next level classes if I'm struggling this much in the intro class.  I've thought about doing asl as I feel there's less to worry about (i.e. writing and speaking), just signing. To me that sounds pretty simple as compared to spoken languages. Additionally, I feel more interested in learning asl than spanish and I feel asl would complement my learning style as I am a visual learner, and enjoy using my hands for other activities such as playing music, digital editing, crafts, etc.  TL;DR: I'm struggling with spanish and thinking about switching to asl. What is your advice/experience with asl? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi there guys, Incoming freshman here, just wondering if laptops are allowed in class. I always thought they were, but my mom and a couple of my coworkers have told me some professors won't let you use them in class. I don't want to drop a grand on a laptop if I'm not going to use it in class. All the best! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am an incoming freshman and I recently got an email with the newsletter for the class of 2021. It said that I should have received an email on the 1st of August regarding information about how to take the three mandatory classes about drug and alcohol education. I never received it. I emailed them about it and haven't gotten a response. I also asked some of the people I met at orientation about it and they said they didn't get the information either. Is there a way to take the classes without getting that email? I don't want to be behind the game before classes even start.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Title. So I have come all the way to sophomore spring without a graphing calculator. I went to an international high school where calculators weren’t allowed so I just have a basic Casio scientific calculator which has served me well for the classes I’ve taken so far. But I’m in Linear Algbera now, and my calculator is unable to handle large matrices. I’m in the market for a good (non programmable) graphing calculator that will serve me well for all my future engineering classes. I’m hearing TI-84 is one of the best. Before I make the splurge, I just wanted you guys’ opinion. (Budget $100-150 max) For reference, I’m a ChemE major. <eos> \n",

I get [this email]([url link] saying delivery would be 115-125 minutes, or around 2 HOURS. This puts delivery time at 3:42am. I've tried to call to see what's up with this delivery time and no one has responded to the 12-13 calls I've made. The worst part is that I paid via credit card so I'm still going to be charged for the pizza. I'm planning on filing a charge-back on the transaction, but it's still upsetting that I have to go through all of this and still end up with out food. **TL;DR**: Don't order from Papa John's at night if you expect to get your pizza. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm thinking about dropping my 5 credit spanish class. However in order to remain a full time student I would have to add another 3 credit class to replace this one.  But would any instructors allow me into their class so late into the semester? Also since the deadline is Monday, would it be ok to just email the instructors asking if I can join their class?  Lastly, online it says dropping a class will affect my queue time for classes next semester? Is that a big deal or is it just to dissuade kids from dropping classes? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I have a lot of midterms falling consistently in the same week, and in the very last week of classes I will have two physics \"quizzes\" as well as two exams. First off, anyone who has had this before, how did you cope with studying and preparing? Second of all, for that last week, is it possible to reschedule at least one? One of them is in Biochemistry, for which there is no cumulative final, so I am really hoping that I can reschedule that last exam for final's week. This seriously terrifies me, please help. My Physics and OChem finals are scheduled for the same time on the same day, but obviously I can fix that, no questions asked, but consistently having most of my exams within two days of each other is not something I think I can get a real exception for. Edit: After careful consideration I've decided that I can make this work, but damn it sucks a lot. Anyone else have this before? It's not like it's unlikely to happen given common exam scheduling. <eos> \n",

Preferably not needing cleats (I have indoor soccer shoes that'd work well enough for turf or if just playing for fun) or shin guards. I've seen some people playing a few times in the mall... Is that part of any regularly scheduled league or something? I'd love to get in a couple of games before it gets too cold to play. <eos> \n",

As the season draws to a close we are attempting to work out the logistics of actually making this happen and we are having a difficult time finding info on it. (Probably to deter exactly what we are trying to do but I digress) If anyone knows about the process or what is required that info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks   <eos> \n",

I'm practical, sensible, generous to a fault and can cook a mean dish and bake an even meaner cake. I pay my bills on time and can overlook human flaws as long as you can overlook mine. Please contact me through pm if you have anything reasonable available. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Do I need to speak to the advisor about this? Moreover, if you have the Global Excellence Scholarship, is 12 credits enough to maintain your scholarship? On the website, it says: \"This includes maintaining full-time enrollment of at least 13 credits per semester and completing at least 30 credits per year. Exceptions can be made in some situations where a student can take a reduced course load and still be on track for on-time graduation.\" <eos> \n",
            "<bos> When considering the University of Minnesota, the term Minnesota Nice has come up a lot. I've heard a mixed bag of responses from people who have moved to Minnesota about it. Some say it's great and people are really polite, while others say it's tough to make friends and find many people to be very passive aggressive. As an out of state student, I'm just wondering how you feel about Minnesota Nice and whether or not it is less exacerbated by being on campus. Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, I know this might be a stupid question but I feel like I've never really gotten a solid answer. At orientation, I believe they told us to spend 2 hours outside of class for every credit hour per week. I'm taking 17 credits, so this means I would spend 34 hours a week studying/doing homework, and 51 hours of total schoolwork a week. I know college is supposed to be hard and time-consuming, I was just wondering if these numbers are accurate. Thanks! 👏👏 <eos> \n",

It's pretty chilly in the room even with my roommates in here too... But it's absolutely freezing in the hallways, especially early in the mornings. If you stand underneath the vent by the elevators, there's always cold air being blasted (despite it already feeling like the antarctic at 6am). I feel like there's a really simple reason behind this but I'm just baffled. Has anybody else been experiencing this too?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So, I'm about 90% sure I'm going to the U for my Master's. Yay! I went to a residential-only liberal arts college in a different state, so finding a place to live is a little overwhelming for me. I'm unmarried, no pets, and ideally want to live in a 1 bed 1 bath on the East Bank. My parents will be helping me out on rent because it's a school expense, so I could afford to live close, possibly in a nicer place like The Marshall or The Knoll (neither of which I saw on the off-campus housing guide, which is why I'm posting). While the amenities seem awesome at these kinds of places, I'm afraid that they'll be full of undergrads who want to party at 8 AM on game day. I'm not a hermit by any means, but my idea of a good time is a little more low-key, i.e. sitting around and drinking and talking.  Is there any way to reach a middle ground, where you have nice amenities and close to campus but without too many drunk underclassmen? Any suggestions would be much appreciated! <eos> \n",

I struggle with using the math book to learn the material and would like someone that could work through problems with me and identify some areas to work on. The class I am in is test and quizzes only and the first mid-term is on the 26th of feb. If you know somebody and or looking to tutor let me know. I am hoping schedules and such will work out.

So my friend and I have already gotten admitted and submitted housing applications for the 17/18 year.  We just aren't sure where we would fit the best. We have decided to room together (We plan on meeting new people together and not just keep to ourselves like some people warn when rooming with a friend) and we are pretty social people. We both party but we're not the type that HAS to party. We look forward to it though. Haha. Anyways, we are both open to meeting new friends and creating relationships and like social atmospheres. We are incoming freshmen and look forward to joining clubs and going to sporting events. Any suggestions? Again, sorry about the repetitive content and long post. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I'll be an international student so I have no frame of reference for the living costs. My husband will be coming with me and will be looking for a job there but we obviously don't know how long it might take to find a job, so we'll both need to live off my stipend for a while at least. We will of course be careful with our money, but I need to be sure we can at least cope. What would you say your overall cost of living is? <eos> \n",

I just realized that 1933 uses Java instead of python and was wondering if you are assumed to have any experience with Java prior to the class?

Each category has its own page, and there is a table of contents type deal on the main page to link to each category. The main page also includes instructions on how to format the text for your review, it's pretty simple stuff. So whenever you're bored, just help out your fellow classmates and write reviews about your classes! I will make reminder posts about the class reviews at the end of every semester. Edit: Oh, and please don't vandalize the pages. We can see all edits, and since we can't only ban people from editing the wiki, you will be banned from the subreddit. <eos> \n",

Is there a poker group I can join or is there just cash games every now and then in the dorms.  Thanks  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I had a hell of a time registering for a class on My U. I had no holds on my account, the class said it was open, had the green dot, and there were seats available. When I went to check out with the class in my \"shopping cart\" I was denied access. I couldn't figure out why.  I visited with my advisor to figure it out, and it turns out that My U doesn't show students which classes have reserved seating, and for whom. Although there were 8 seats open in the class I wanted, nowhere did it tell me the class's remaining seats were reserved. My advisor had to check in PeopleSoft, a service students don't have access to, to find that information. It's a pretty lousy user interface for students trying to register. There should really be some sort of notice letting a student know a class has only reserved seating left. My advisor says he's had quite a few confused students having the very same problem.  So if you're having similar issues trying to register for an \"open class\" this fall, check with your advisor and try to find a back up. It's probably reserved even though it won't tell you.  Hope this saves someone from some stress, even though it's still frustrating. <eos> \n",

If you didn’t know, we are going to have a reddit meet up in the **lower floor** of the [cube]( [url link] from **1:00 PM to 2:00 PM tomorrow** Tuesday Oct 25th. If there are some people that want to meet up a little earlier, feel free to post it. I’ll reddit meet up with you! How will you know which person I am? Look for the person with XY chromosomes and holding this [sign]( [url link] . While I’d love just to talk to you guys about my new favorite memes (not really… unless you are super cute.), bring **people and stuff to the meet up**! The more the jollier (plus it will give us something to do)! Have a favorite game you like to play? Bring it and share the fun will all of us! Have a girlfriend with two legs, two arms, and a symmetrical face? Bring her, and get her to know us! Also I want to bring snacks for this reddit meet up. So post what your favorite snacks are and post if you are coming so I can figure how much I need to bring!  . TL;DR Meet up bottom of the cube. Vote for what snacks you want. Bring stuff you want to do, and friends! . P.S. I might not be able to make the next next Wednesday meet up, so someone may have to hold the banner. And yes the banner is in comic sans. Deal with it.  <eos> \n",

I understand that transfer students are really only up for scholarships from their academic college (mine would be CFANS), but are there any other opportunities I should know about?

            "<bos> So, my freshman year, in '05, I started a MTG club in Middlebrook that [flourished]([url link] We played every Friday night and it was a blast.  Since then, we have been able to stay in Middlebrook and play, but last year, our youngest member moved out of the dorms (whoops, res halls). So we are looking for a new place to sling cards.  Various game stores have been suggested, but, as you probably already know if you care about this sort of thing, no game stores are near campus, and as I am the only one with a car, more or less, the res halls and college itself are integral to keeping us together, as they are so central to our locations. So, friends, this is a [call to arms.]([url link] If you want to play with us, let me know! We're fun people. If you live in the halls and have a place with a lot of tables where we can aggregate more people, even better! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi! I may be bringing a moped to campus this Fall and had a question about storage. My house doesn't have a garage (nor did I expect it to), so I was wondering what most people did with their mopeds once winter rolled around. Is there any cheap storage around? I think my last resort may be asking some friends who live close by, but I would prefer to not do that. I know some apartments have storage in their parking structures, but those all require contracts and are at least ~$25 a month.  Let me know if you have any ideas, they are greatly appreciated! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I told her I was going to make this ad for her on the UofMN subreddit, and she hasn't stopped me so here are the details. My girlfriend is lonely from a lack of friends besides her live-in boyfriend. She's shy and has little to no ego. She's not aggressive at starting friendships, and frankly the opportunities don't come around for her too often because of her personality (she isn't a bad person, but she doesn't get along with the average mind). I figured Reddit itself and especially the UofMN subreddit would be a nice place to put up a \"personal\" ad because of the type of people that frequent here (vs. the general population on campus). My girlfriend is a Computer Science major and a self-described \"gamer\" who plays mostly World of Warcraft. She can smoke a pot, drink an ethanol, and munch a shroom. She is turned off by superficial, egotistical, drama-seeking personalities which we feel the average girl is mostly composed of. If you're unique, geeky, open-minded, not overly attention seeking, and way laid back, then I think you should meet her. She is thin, has two arms, two legs, and a symmetrical face, but that shouldn't even matter. Her boyfriend is (I am) a Computer Science/Computer Engineering major, so you'll be dealing with techy gamer peeps all over the place if you want to meet her. Does this friend-offer stand out to anyone? I'm accepting questions and date-offers. :) (Girlfriend has proof-read and agreed to this post) <eos> \n",

I'm working on the first assessment and I'm a bit baffled that it has to be handwritten. I'm questioning if all assessments are like this because I'm working full time and doing this course. It takes a long time to hand write all this out. Seems a bit odd... <eos> \n",

I finished my last topic, but I did not master it, so I have 89 mastered topics and 1 learned topic. However, I cannot find anywhere to master that one topic. Can I just leave it as a learned topic and still be considered to have 100%? The placement test site is vague in this regard; it only says I have to \"improve my learning mode score to 100%.\" <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have a couple questions about the parking, but it basically boils down to what are the differences and dis-/advantages of the different types of parking, besides cost. I'm especially unclear of the differences between ramps and garages, as I've only ever heard those terms used interchangeably. As for lots, my main concern is how they deal with snow. Do they have set times that they plow, at which your car has to be out of the lot, and if so, can you temporarily park elsewhere? Or do they just plow the main aisles? <eos> \n",

They were visiting Duluth and met a Rabbi Rothstein. The only mention I found of him is in a dissertation that was written at your university. It should be online accessible with an University of Minnesota library account. It was hoping one of you could help me out and access the thesis for me and send me a screenshot/copy of the part concerning Rabbi Rothstein. I would be really grateful!

I absolutely love Geology as well as chemistry so I'd like to do both ChemE and ESci. I'd like to graduate in 4 years, as money is hard for my family, but if I absolutely have to I'll take out student loans if I have to stay another year.

I am a national merit semi-finalist and will almost definitely be a finalist. I'm an ap scholar, I have a pretty good gpa, top 15% of the class, I have many extracurricular activities, like band, academic competitions, government related stuff. Blah blah blah. I'm looking at a few other colleges. UChicago, if I can swing it, Yale, as a total pipe dream, Alabama, Ole Miss, maybe a liberal arts college or two. I have no idea what I'll major in. I'm pretty interested in economics and political science and maybe chemistry. I like almost everything I study, except for physics... I just like to learn. Can you tell me what majors or departments are especially strong at Minnesota? To be completely honest, a significant factor in deciding where I want to go to college is its acceptance of LBGT folks. I'm gay, but I'm not out, because hello, I live in Mississippi. Minnesota's pretty tolerant, right? And I know it's a little colder there than it is in Mississippi. We get snow twice a year at most. Can I survive Minnesota winter? **tl;dr** do you think I have a shot at some of the merit scholarships? what are the strongest departments? is it cool if I'm gay? does the sun shine there? edit: thank y'all for your responses. I feel pretty reassured now and I'm definitely going to come up for a visit. <eos> \n",

FYI, I didn't go to school last fall so I'm basically a first semester sophomore this spring. Weird right. Anyway here are the housing options I'm considering: 1. Attempting to get a single in 17th or Sanford 2. Finding random roommates for renting an apartment or house in Dinky area (!!) 3. Hoping I make friends this semester and finding a place with them (this is dependent on the future however and my social skillz) 4. Possibly joining a sorority Questions: Would it be weird for a junior (credit-wise a second semester sophomore) to get a single in a traditional dorm hall? Would I be able to meet people at all this way? What are your suggestions for off-campus housing? I'm a bit lost with all of this. Is there a place I can go to on campus to ask for more information? **Feel free to answer any or all of the questions! I'm just looking for a bit of insight :) Thank you!!! **Edited <eos> \n",

Some of the class reviews on ratemyprofessor cite Professor Smith as one to test from class notes, but I did all of the assigned reading last semester and am nervous about skipping assigned readings. Can any students with past experience with this class confirm that not all of the reading is truly required? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I feel it is worth to get the experience at the company, as it would look good on a CV/Resume, but my parents are opposing the decision, saying it's not worth taking time off of school for an internship/co-op. What does the sub think? Should I take the co-op or not? I appreciate your opinions. Btw, I am a CLA student studying Computer Science <eos> \n",

I looked at the website and they do a terrible job of explaining what exactly is critical parking.

If not, do you happen to know of any professors who hire freshman undergrad CS students as TAs?

Well, unfortunately for us, the two of them who were not on the lease backed out. Now we're desperately looking for one person to share and one to have their own room. The rent would be around 320 to share and 530 for your own room. If you or anyone you know or even a friend of a friend is looking for a place to live (its brand new and super nice), message me!! p.s - we are girls, we would be fine with a guy having his own room but the girl sharing doesn't want a guy to share with. :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Tomorrow is my first day as a transfer student to the U! :) I have a sizable break between my morning and afternoon class. I am a commuter so I can't go hang out at a dorm/apartment. What do you usually do during larger breaks between classes? I am taking BBE2201 online so I was thinking of bringing some earbuds and listening to the lectures for this class and getting ahead on assignments in the library... but are there better options for something to do? Also, another quick question - if i bring some slightly crunchy snacks (baby carrots, crackers, etc.) to the library while I am working will there be dirty looks given by other library goers? Should I find somewhere else on campus to eat and study simultaneously? (I am on West Bank all day if you have any suggestions for better locations) <eos> \n",

(If it won't let you vote right now, check back later. There are some issues with the site that are being investigated.) It has basically come down to Hedberg  Griffin or Mike + Fiona.  My vote will go to Hedberg  Griffin, who truly are some stand-up guys with solid goals layed out to benefit the undergraduate community. (Adam + Mark, two other candidates, withdrew from the race last night and now fully endorse Hedberg  Griffin!) Learn more about Hedberg  Griffin's specific plans: www.hedbergandgriffin.com or visit their facebook page: [url link] Visit Mike + Fiona's facebook page: [url link] Honestly, both of these pairs have great ideas, but please VOTE. The voter turnout last year was 15%. Help change that.  <eos> \n",

I'm especially interested in the rigor of the coursework, the practical applicability of the curriculum, and how successful grads are in the job market afterward. Any information you guys could give me would be great! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, fellow gophers! I'm an avid guitar and piano/keyboard player and I've been playing music ever since I was 10. Let's cut straight to the chase, I'm trying to form a band on campus, but my past efforts haven't amounted to much due to low commitment from myself, and my fellow bandmates. I think it's time to change that. I'm looking for a bass guitarist, a drummer, and a vocalist. The music I play is mainly rock/blues, so feel free to leave a comment if you're interested in joining! <eos> \n",

I have a 3.7 Cumulative GPA (4.0 Calc 1 and 2, 2.7 Calc 3, 4.0 Calc 4, 3.0 Physics 1) and from high school I had a 32 on the ACT. Do I have a good chance into CSE (Looking into aero or mechanical)? Also how does the U view transfers? My school only accepts transfers from community college unless you have a really good reason and hates 4 year college transfers <eos> \n",

It has 4041 as a prerequisite but I'm in 2011 and not exactly loving it. I would much rather take some web-based class or something than 4041 but if that will prohibit me from taking 5115, I'll just suck it up and take it. Any insights?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> **TL;DR Be on the lookout for people breaking into houses/apartments/fraternity houses over spring break!** In the past 5 days, my fraternity has been broken into twice by the same people. On Friday, they broke in and stole two laptops, an iPad, and a backpack at 10 am (in broad daylight!). This morning at 9 am, I had someone come into my room and start digging through my belongings. He didn't see me at first, but I confronted him before he ran away. The first break in was performed by two African American males, early 20's. One was approximately 5' 9\" with a normal build, and unshaven face. The other male was approximately 5' 6\" with dreadlocks. The first male (5' 9\") was the one that was in my room this morning. He was wearing a grey hoodie sweatshirt and a green stocking hat. He did not steal anything this morning. I know it's a long shot, but if you hear of these people trying to sell any of these items on craigslist or on the street, please PM me as soon as possible. We have locked the iPad, but could not recover the location because location services were turned off. We have filed two different police reports for both incidences. **More importantly, protect yourselves by being watchful. I would never want something like this to happen to any of you!** Missing:  White iPad 2 16GB Wifi only,  15\" MacBook Pro Model Number MD104LL/A (serial number c02j58m0dv35) 15\" Dell Inspiron 15r with a i7 processor 8gb ram 1TB HDD <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey Gophers.  Like many freshman, I am trying to figure out where I will live next fall. Strongly considering the Marshall at the moment but wondering if I should look beyond the \"big name\" apartments that surround the U. I want to try to avoid spending a bunch of money on a \"nice apartment\" if the apartment isn't actually going to turn out to be that nice. (Have heard a few things about \"luxury apartments\" being cramped, loud, and poorly managed.) Is it better to look a farther off campus/beyond the big corporate apartments? I am hoping to live with three other people, and would love to spend five-hundred or less a month. I would appreciate hearing any of your advice and experiences. Thanks!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Just wondering if anyone has park at oak street parking ramp for over 24 hours. If so was the fee $12? Or does it exceed $12? I would assume it would go over $12 since at that point it says \"$12.00 daily maximum.\" <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently going into my last semester here at the U and have to say I'm worried about the political climate here on campus. I came to the U to escape the conservative echo chamber of rural Texas. But it has become apparent that the U of Mn is just as bad but it's opposite. I think our student body pres. Abeer has created a climate where no one can voice their opinion without fear of being chastised unless it agrees with the agenda of the far left. Let me make this clear, I'm not a conservative in any sense of the word. I just feel that all sides should be able to feel comfortable voicing their opinions about campus goings on without fear of chastisement or being labeled a racist/bigot.  <eos> \n",

Seemed like they were assessing a situation and then called an ambulance too. They are taking a lot of time and the paramedics haven’t come out either for around 20 minutes.

I was just wondering if I should be an RA my sophomore year. I am worried about money, and I figured this would save me some.

Somehow I lost my wallet today in the morning on campus, in less than an hour, I received an email from the University Lost  Found saying that someone returned it there. All my cash and my cards untouched. Definitely something that I can confidently say not everyone would do, so thanks to that someone as they saved me from a stressful day to my already stressful week. <eos> \n",

But to my knowledge, housing for Fall 2019 opens soon (November 1st?) so prospective students should put in a deposit asap. I was wondering, what hall should a freshman attending the CLA (psych major) apply for? Is there one hall in particular that's closest to CLA buildings? I'm kinda a quiet, nerdier type--not too big on sports, but I don't mind them, either. Are there halls with different personalities and stuff? Also--are roommates randomly assigned? Or can you get matched with similar people? It'd be cool to be boarded up with someone who has a couple of mutual interests. Also, I'm lgbtq and don't want to make a random roommate uncomfortable by that fact.  Thanks so much! <eos> \n",

I was such a naive freshman who thought he'd be best friends with the first people he met... I couldn't get a contract release. I'm going through phases of acceptance, tolerance, frustration, anxiety, sadness... I mean I'll live... I just wanted to see if anybody had any opinions/experiences/advice for me.  Also, if I couldn't get a contract release, am I allowed to sub-lease? For part/entire year? <eos> \n",

This is a crucial medical device that is not of any use for anyone without a lung issue, or any market value (cannot sell). These are extremely expensive to replace and he needs it to keep his lungs healthy.  Please DM me if anyone has any details regarding the situation. Edit: Happened in Como, not on campus. My apologies. Thank you <eos> \n",

Unfortunately I might have to give up my spot, as i may leave the U after this spring semester. The place has a great location in Dinkytown, right by the Marshall and Target. It's a short walk to campus and has all the benefits of the Dinkytown businesses. Another major plus is that it's cheap at $400 a month, which is a great price for Dinkytown apartments.

My three friends and I are looking to sign a 12-month lease at [Stadium View Apartments]([url link] with a move-in date of August 31.

To start, I'm super bad with math, and I can do it while taking the course, but won't remember it right off the top of my head once I'm done with it. Therefore, I'm worry that I will not go far in my computer science course bc I'm not smart enough in math. Could I receive some tips and maybe stories of others who had a hard time, but found success? I'm afraid to go to the TA's bc they might look down on me when I ask for help and can't do simple math at the top of my head. Taking 1133 (currently).  <eos> \n",

Cash games maybe $.02/$.05-$.10/$.25 range? I'm open to different scenarios... just throwing my exact preferences out there in case enough people are interested enough just to start our own game. Let me know if you're interested or have an open spot in your regular game. Thanks! EDIT: I have heard from 2-3 interested people. It looks like we might be just trying to start our own game.

            "<bos> I'm a transfer student looking at the U for the fall. I just have some questions! Where do you think is a good dorm for transfers to live? NOT the transfer house please, I just prefer elsewhere. Also, as far as dorms go... are there any that are in between a party dorm and a super quiet one? I don't want to be living with \"boring\" people but also don't want to live where it's crazy. I visited a friend in Comstock which I think sophomores can live in (that's what I'll be coming as)? I liked it overall, I also heard Yudof is good if I'm not looking for a full on dorm. I want to be in the East Bank although all my major courses would be in west, so I liked those two cause they were on the edge. Thanks for all suggestions! <eos> \n",

My thought is that I should attend, because students are supposed to treat internships like jobs. However; I really don't want to commute tomorrow during the cold.  Also, she was totally fine with me taking off spring break, which to me seems like she is treating it in some accordance with the school.  Thanks <eos> \n",

I feel like an old man saying this, but the whole thing is just immature and entirely catered to the frats (I know, that's what it's meant to be, but still). <eos> \n",

What I'm curious is how much does BIOL refer to the lecture? Since I am not taking the lecture for BIOL 2005, will it be harder for me since I'm only taking the lab? What should I be expecting to do in this lab and what tips would you guys have for me in order to succeed in this lab? Thank you! <eos> \n",

I just have some questions I'd like answered if anyone here has taken it before.  Do you need your own transportation? (assuming yes) Can you go off on your own or do you stay by your instructor? Are there any additional fees? Like paying for a pass from the place you go. Thanks all! <eos> \n",

I'm a bit of an introvert, and don't really have a whole lot of chances to get out of my dorm because of it, and also because I've been a bit swamped with homework. Don't let me being an introvert scare you off: I'm definitely up for meeting new people, especially people with similar interests. I just don't really know how to deal with some situations, and I'm perfectly fine being by myself. Anyway, to get to the point: I'm a HUGE video game person, so you'll generally find me in my room, gaming on my pc and talking with some of my friends back home over skype. If you're interested in getting to know me, and want to game together over steam (or even over 3DS), just send me a friend request! thanks!   TL;DR: Freshman, that doesn't have friends on campus yet, looking for people to game on PC with.

            "<bos> Hey all, My friend is teaching a cool new class this coming semester and is looking to get a few more students for it. It's ENT 1480: Topics in Entomology. The theme for the course is \"Insects: The Good, The Bad, and the Bugly.\" It will cover how insects have influenced human society, and will touch on: * insects in film and literature * insect art * insects as perceived by cultures around the world * insects as food * pest insects * beneficial insects * and a bunch of cool insect biology (including kinky bug sex) My friend's a phenomenal teacher, and the course syllabus looks really fun. It's designed to appeal to everyone, from liberal arts students to science majors. So if you need a cool class for next semester, consider this one. And spread the word if you know someone who might be interested! It's 3 credits and will be from 09:45 A.M. - 11:00 A.M on Tuesdays and Thursdays. No prereqs required. There's also a Facebook page where the course instructors post cool insect-related news from time to time: [url link] <eos> \n",

If any of you are on this subreddit, I'd love for you to give your insight either here or through a message. Thanks!! What is your biggest piece of advice for applicants? What is one thing you think everyone should know about your program that isn’t included on the website? What kind of student does the admissions committee typically look for? What is the biggest mistake applicants make? What is one thing you wish you would have known before you started the program?

As I'm preparing to buy stuff for my dorm, I wanted to know if the wifi/ethernet, specifically in Frontier, is strong enough to support watching netflix, HBO Go, etc through a roku, or if it's even allowed since netflix and other online streaming takes so much bandwidth. Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was lucky enough under a grant between Melrose and Boynton to receive care for eating disorders at Melrose with no out of pocket costs. But the therapist there has told me that most of my issues stem from depression/anxiety and Melrose would prefer if I could find someone else. I already tried Boynton, and honestly, the therapist I had constantly emphasized how she couldn't treat me effectively until I got a handle on my eating disorder. So you can see the loop I'm stuck in. What are some affordable, good quality therapists/mental health services near campus that aren't a part of Boynton? No eating disorder clinic suggestions, I'm still receiving care from Melrose.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm looking for info anyone can give me who has a) done this b) worked for HR and can tell me the process/reasons accepted to get out of the housing contract for living in the dorms for spring semester?  I've made friends here and I'll keep them but the drain on my and my parent's finances, coupled with the fact that my room is terrible and extremely difficult to live in, means I want out of this contract for the spring semester. I'm not happy here, and functioned a lot better at home. If you know about the contract you need a really good reason to get out of the contract such as military duty, verifiable medical issues, or marriage. So anyone who knows about the process- can you give me any advice on how to successfully get out of my contract? Any reasons that they will take, who to talk to, etc. I really don't want to live here. I'm in a single in centen. My parents also had some unexpected expenses- with the house, car, etc. and so they would really like me to move back. I am getting no where near my money's worth for the meal plan and would function much better if I had more control over my life, which the dorms do not give me.  <eos> \n",

Are there low pressure, decent quality amateur groups playing it with all the rules of the game ? I guess, football will be more difficult to manage than baseball. Where do people usually play by themselves ? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have been accepted into CFANS for Animal Science and am looking at my housing options for next year. I was just notified of my acceptance to the honors college and am considering the Honors LLC in Middlebrook, but have also been looking at the Prevet LLC in Bailey since I would be around students who are also interested in vet med. Has anyone experienced either of these LLCs? I feel like the Honors LLC would be cool, but I don't know if I'd be missing out on making important connections with other prevet students. I also don't know which residence hall would provide a better overall living experience. Though I would be in CFANS, I heard that most first year classes would take place on the East bank campus... so maybe living in Middlebrook would actually be more convenient? I would appreciate any insight/feedback, thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I'm failing all my classes this semester due to depression + paralyzing anxiety + financial issues that are making me work too much. I suck, I've ruined my life, etc.  I only have about 30 credits to go till I graduate, and up till now my GPA wasn't terribly low (3.2).

Anyone know if there's anything in particular I should be doing to keep the road back open?  Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Some of my best friends from freshman year who are living together have begun flaking on me and are not available to meet whenever I text them. For context, I live in a dorm while they are living together in an apartment. Is it just me, or does everyone go through this? I have Asperger's syndrome and I'm afraid that this social interaction is causing this relationship to fizzle. I really would like for us to be good friends like freshman year, but I don't see that happening in the near future and its making me anxious.

I am currently enrolled for BIOL 1010, but I heard that this class has a heavy I workload. I don't mind a hard class, but I would just prefer it if I would not be spending a majority of time towards a general class. Is BIOL 1055 less heavy? And also, I am waitlisted #8 for the lecture for 1055, is there any hope I'll get in or is it a lost cause? Thanks <eos> \n",

All proceeds will help fund our group's public outreach program, public guest speakers, and professional development activities.

The sale is from 10:30am-3:30pm at two locations: Hodson Hall (3rd floor, right outside the Natural Resources Library) and the St. Paul Student Center (lower level, near the services desk).  Come stop by and grab a truly unique holiday gift for someone special, or a sweet treat for yourself (you deserve it)! :-) It's a great way to buy local and support an awesome student group. More info can be found on the FB event page: [url link] Frenatae is a registered nonprofit organization. Our mission is to foster a better understanding and appreciation of insects and their kin in the greater Minnesota community, as well as to promote the professional development of entomology students at the U.

            "<bos> So about two-three weeks ago. my computer started having issues whenever I opened the lid; the right side of the keyboard seemed to be coming loose and would make a horrid cracking sound every time I opened it past halfway. So I brought it in to the Coffman bookstore, seeing as it was the closest option, and here's where the fun began. The guy behind the counter looked at it for about 3 minutes, noticed that two main screws were missing, and then informed me that the sockets were stripped, and that I would need to have a whole new keyboard panel ordered for roughly $250. At that point I was shocked with that price tag, so I asked if they had any of those small screws to just attempt to see if that would work. That was met with a stern \"No.\" I walked out the door, computer in hand, very frustrated with the experience. After some searching in some local computer stores I found the screws, put them in, tightened the other screws across the entire laptop, and what would you know it's as good as new.  I then went back, with the screws out, inquiring about the same problem to see if maybe that one guy I got the first time was new or something. The second time I get quoted $310 for an entire repair. I then proceed to take out the screws, screw them in gently, and show him like magic my computer is fixed. They didn't have much to say after that.  So, fellow Gophers, if you have any computer problems, try local computer repair places, or if it seems to be something somewhat simple like my problem, give it a shot yourself. Don't give those assholes in Coffman a cent of your money. <eos> \n",

Does anyone have any advice on this? Anything from getting in to U of M as a transfer to easing myself into Twin Cities (if I get in, of course) would be much appreciated. I'd love if some transfers chimed in, but i'd also like to hear from any student on why they like the school.  Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just looking for some suggestions. My roommates and I are looking at places to live next year and trying to find good deals. We will have 4 or 5 people trying to live together and are currently paying 422 per person plus around $20 for electricity/laundry, so we would like to keep it around there or lower if possible. Some of my roommates would like their own rooms and personally, I would like to be within like 15 minutes walking distance of Northrop mall area. I know that's asking a lot, but anyone know of any places like this? <eos> \n",

Would they be able to get into the game using their UMD U Card? I just don't know how closely they look at your ID when you enter the game! They look very similar, just slightly different font/background color!  <eos> \n",

We are confused on how we can know which houses will be available for the next school year.

I have AP credit for Math 1271, 1272; Physics 1301, 1302; Chemistry 1061, 1062, 1065, 1066; and Writing 1301. |Course|Credits| |:-|:-| |CHEM 2331H|3| |CHEN 2001|4| |CSE 1001|1| |MATH 2573H|4| |MATS 3011|3| I'm also considering adding HSEM 3075H: Humans and Rights in Historical Perspective.

            "<bos> I've read a few of the posts on here regarding housing, but most are pretty dated (2-3 years old). I've been accepted into CLA, and I'm looking to apply to housing once it opens, yet I don't have a first choice yet. 17th Ave looks nice, but I feel as though freshmen will not be prioritized. I've looked into Sanford, seems nice. Heard the athletes (many of which who live there) can be obnoxious, is this just a stereotype? I've heard many positives but just as many negatives about Comstock as well. Which is the best hall in the Superblock for someone who wants to go to parties but also get sleep? I hear some of the superblock halls are ridden with drunks and partiers every night, and I can't see myself fitting in with that scene nicely. I see value in living with lots of freshmen though. Basically, what dorm is good for someone who is simultaneously studious but very social and appreciates the party scene as well?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> How prevalent is skateboarding on campus, particularly as a means of transportation? Is it practical, assuming you can ride one well? I thought about a bike, but thought it would be more of a hassle to store and maintain.  I have hardly touched a skateboard in my life, but I think I could learn pretty quickly. I am seriously considering picking up some sort of portable, short, cruiser board (perhaps a penny board or similarly sized wooden deck) for use next fall. I read in some old regulations that skateboards aren't actually allowed on campus, but I was wondering if this was something that is really followed. I am not looking to do any tricks. Really, I would just use one to get myself to class and wherever else I'm going. Seems like it would be especially nice for getting across the bridge, as I'll be living in Middlebrook. Let me know what you think based on your experience on campus. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I also looked him up on Facebook but he has a fairly common asian name. What else should i try? Also, do they allow a fridge that's over 4.3 cubic inches (i saw one that is 4.4 and i figured that they wouldn't care that much if it was 1 in. over) Would they allow that? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello Reddit, I’m a graduate student (male) coming to UMN this Fall. I’m looking for two, three or even four more students who are interested in living off campus for the next academic year. I’m not looking for graduate students in particular, and am open to living with undergraduates as well.  About myself; I’m patient, tolerant, pragmatic and cheerful. I would like to consider myself as tidy, but I’m definitely not a clean freak. I’m into Movies, Novels and Anime. I do spend a lot of time on video games, mostly RPG and Strategy games. Although I’m not much of a party person myself, I have no issues with drinking/smoking, as long as there is no smoking inside the house.  I would like to mention that I have not found housing yet. I’m hoping that I could find three or four roommates and we all could find a place near campus that best suits all our needs. I would prefer living with three or four people over the traditional two person house.  So if you’re interested, PM me and we can discuss more.  <eos> \n",

I'm pretty much only taking courses for my major this semester: 3 journalism classes worth 9 credits. 1 public health class worth 1 credit and a music history class worth 3 credits. Theoretically, if I fail my music class but get B's or A's in my other classes, how will that look? Is it possible to be put on academic probation just for failing the music class? <eos> \n",

Either I'm trippin or people are super cliquey in Minnesota... why can't anyone look up from their phone when they're going to class? Why can't people look me in the eye?

I love art..painting writing poetry, talking about deep weird stuff. going to improv, finding new things to do!  <eos> \n",

And also if the syllabus states that tests are all multiply choice or mix of that, short answer, etc? I am not in the class but am considering switching into it, unfortunately the syllabus seems to only be accessible for students currently enrolled.

I looked at previous final exams and they didn't compare to the types of problems on my midterm. The review the lecturer gave us is a compilation of bad wording, making everything confusing AF. After the exam i don't know what I'll do...I'll probably go home and get drunk to try to forget why I listened to my advisor in taking this course. <eos> \n",

Are the showers in the locker rooms private stalls or are they the open communal type? I'm considering renting a locker for the semester but it's only worth it to me if the gym has private shower stalls. I'll be living in superblock so it's not a huge deal to walk back there to shower. Any other tips or info I should know about the recwell center? Thanks for your help :)  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently looking at the MS in CS program at the U, and I was wondering if anyone here has gone through the program/knows anyone else who has. Specifically, I'm curious about timeframes: for the different plans, it seems the general consensus that the program takes about two years, but I've heard in general that thesis based masters programs (not necessarily at the U) can drag on past that point because of the intensity of writing a thesis. Does anyone know if that commonly happens for folks in Plan A or B? Conversely, is it common for students to finish the program in less than two years? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> In 2012, the most recent data I could find, the highest paid professor in the college of design was Professor Mary M. Guzowski, who made $98,870. The college of liberal arts fared a little better, where Professor Eugene Borgida made $205,680. It seems the university does not recognize the importance of the art of design, but even worse, if you look at the college of science and engineering, it is clear the university has a completely inappropriate STEM bias, as Professor Frank Bates made $293,343. The university has claimed it believes in a liberal education. Did you know our school motto is, \"A common bond for all the arts\"? Yet, at the same time, it clearly holds a STEM bias. I petition that we end this bias and create a pay schedule based exclusively on experience (eg: 50yrs teaching makes more than 1yr teacher) and title (eg: regents professor makes more than adjunct professor) - not discipline (eg: CSE professor makes more than CDES professor). <eos> \n",

We are provided with .csv files and then have to copy and paste the command inputs and outputs to a word doc and send it to the professor...  Surely the other stats class doesn't have this same homework method, does it? Today is the last day to switch classes so if I hear that STAT 3011 sounds better than what I'm currently taking, I'm going to switch. Anybody take STAT 3011? <eos> \n",

Listen, I'm as happy as the next guy that both the amendments failed, but it's been three weeks since the election and much of the \"vote no\" defacement is still up. I'm talking about the stuff on Tate, Walter, Jones Eddy circle and surrounding areas, and wherever else it might be. We're lucky enough to have a beautiful campus, let's keep it that way. You put it up and beat the amendment, now clean up after yourself.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Does this area of computer science research take in undergraduate researchers? I find myself drawn into this, rather than some of the applied areas of research, but it seems so daunting. Would they even want an undergraduate to join them?

            "<bos> Hi, So I applied to a masters program (Water Resources Science) back in December. Fast forward to early March and I was invited to tour campus and meet with faculty (I talked to other folks involved in graduate recruitment at my undergrad university and they said that less than 10% get invited to tour and meet faculty). Visited campus and talked specifically with two faculty who were interested in me joining their lab, both meetings went really well and left feeling I made a good impression. Yesterday, I received an email from one professor that competition was tough and they couldn't offer a spot in their lab. The other professor has not gotten back to me despite me sending a polite/friendly email about 10 days ago, saying that I enjoyed meeting with him and that I would like to go to this particular university and another email yesterday, inquiring about status of applications. This professor did seem very interested in having me join his lab as he asked what other schools I was applying to and to let him know that I was interested in going to this particular school. My question is would it be seen negatively to call the professor to get a hold of him, as he has not emailed back after two emails? Thanks for all your help. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am a CS major about to take CSCI 2021 next semester. I've always heard from upperclassmen that CSCI 2021 is basically a nightmare in terms of difficulty. What are factors that contribute to the difficulty of this course? Is it C/Assembly programming, math, low-level concepts, bad professor, confusing lab, difficult exam, or an unholy mixture of all of them?

Thus, I have two questions.  Can I buy components in person, or do they only do online ordering?   Are their services for class projects and research only, or do they also supply for personal projects?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So last semester was a complete flop with 16 credits. I had 2 languages (Arabic and Chinese, 5 and 6 credits respectively), Calc 1271 and a one credit class called Success Over Stress. I was failing calc so bad that I had to drop out, but it was not so bad for my first semester in college. I learned a lot about time management, and with these new found skills, I have deluded myself into thinking that 20 credits is absolutely fine.  CHN 1012 (6 credits), ARAB 1102 (5 credits), PE 1044 (Self-defense, 1 credit), CSCL 1101 (4 credits), and ECON 1101 (4 credits). I’m kinda set on taking these classes so I’m mostly looking for tips on the classes or insider information or literally anything to help me survive. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

Anyone of you in Grandmarc? Thanks! <eos> \n",

We only really need one top-level comment for each dorm, but the more reviews the merrier. Here are the dorms on campus in no particular order: Frontier Hall - Superblock - Freshmen only Pioneer Hall - Superblock - Freshmen only Territorial Hall - Superblock - Freshmen only Centennial Hall - Superblock Sanford Hall - Close to Dinkytown Middlebrook Hall - West Bank Comstock Hall - Close to Coffman Bailey Hall - St. Paul Campus [List of halls on UMN housing page]([url link] The plan is to put a link to this in the comments so we have one central place to direct questions about housing. <eos> \n",

I am in Physics 1301W and my grade is much lower than I expected with the effects of a curve. My letter grade reflects how my grade would be without any curve at the moment, so I am not sure if the course was just not curved at all or if they are still waiting to do that. <eos> \n",

I'm not a TA or anyone affiliated with the college, it just helped me so much through an incredibly stressful semester and I highly recommend it. It's offered online only, and is only 2 credits workload. The instructors care a lot about how you are doing and the grading is fairly easy. Each week the assignments are to learn about a new wellness practice, try it out, write about what you did, and take a short easy quiz to make sure you went over the principles. It covers really important wellness areas like coping with negative emotions, meditation, mindfulness, time in nature, wellness models, and tons of other things. The class discussions are a great way to talk through how you are doing and what the weekly practice is like for you. In my last very stressful semester I thought I was going to simply snap from the stress, but this class helped me learn how to move forward despite it.  It's full for Fall 2018, but if you have the opportunity to take it in the future I recommend it. If you have any other questions, please let me know! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Kind of a weird question but basically, what is the best way to get around the Minneapolis campus? Last year I just walked which was ok, but a little time consuming and tiring. I live at home in Lakeville so I can't easily bring something big like a bike there on the bus/in my car.  Would something like a longboard work? I assume I could just bring that into class without issues, but I'm not sure.  Thanks for any help I receive! <eos> \n",

I don't have any friends or know anyone IRL who is or was a student of UofMN, so I'm just a clueless guy. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

It's information used to be at this link: [url link] However, that link seems to be down, and I think that since the event has happened, they took down the information.

I don't really have any good friends so idk if anyone had any suggestions on meeting people?  I'm already in 4 clubs and a fraternity, but I have a hard time meeting people that are as accepting as my old friends were (I've got some pretty bad anxiety and on and off depression which most people just stop talking to me once they find out...)

            "<bos> Hey, just looking on some opinions on whether I should take 1061 or 1015 for chemistry. I've taken an intro to Chem course in high school freshman year and that's about all my experience. Taking the pretest I've had to look up most of it to be able to answer the questions. Overall, how difficult is 1061/65? I would like not to have to take 1015 because it would put me behind in terms of requirements. Just wondering if I'm going to have a tough time keeping up in 1061. I've heard from a few people 1061 is pretty easy and they go into it with no experience. Just want to know of this is accurate for people who recently have taken the course. Any advice would be appreciated. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I am graduating this semester with my family social science degree (CEHD) and I was under the impression that I could attend a different schools commencement since CEHD doesn't have one in the fall. I thought that CLA walked this semester but apparently they don't either (just an event in McNamara). Does anyone know of a college that has a commencement ceremony this semester and if people from other colleges can walk? Or am I going to have to wait for spring semester? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello everyone. Like many of you, I will be attempting to sublease my apartment for this upcoming summer. Due to financial reasons, I cannot afford to stay in Minneapolis and pay rent at my apartment. It will be nearly impossible to do so without a subleaser, as well, seeing as my loans will run out at the end of the semester. I was curious as to just how hard subleasing is. The details: I live in Sydney Hall. Yes, it is owned by Doran and yes, it is a full years lease. I actually really enjoy living here and would recommend the hall due to its proximity to campus. Anyways, I would rent from mid May to Sept 1st and would only charge for 3 months of rent. I pay around $525 a month for a SHARED bedroom. Obviously, I understand people do not want to pay the full price, especially for a shared room, so i'd drop rent to about $315 a month for those 3 months. I'm a male and live with another guy in my room and two females in the other. The other guy would also probably be subleasing, but there is no guarantee. I'm just curious, because I know a lot of people start placing their ads now. I'm worried about the situation already, and i'm really hoping someone is willing to pay that low rent to be so close to campus. I'm desperate to find someone, because I can not shell out $1500 in rent over the summer when I will be employed at home. For those of you who bash Doran: Sydney is actually a really nice hall. I've contacted the CEO of Doran and he has been very helpful with the process of either getting employed to earn some extra cash, or helping me find someone to sublease.  Thanks for the help guys!  <eos> \n",

I also want to study Computer science, as I believe it will be extremely beneficial for job placement and useful with a graphic design degree. I have no experience with computer science, but I have read that many compsci majors did not have any experience prior to college.  Would the workload of a Graphic Design major and a Computer Science (BA at CLA) major be too much? I considered just minoring in computer science because that might be more manageable. Any thoughts from current students of either or related fields would be appreciated.  <eos> \n",

I'm deciding between the STEM Diversity House (my major will either be Chemistry or ChemE) or the Environment House since I'm into sustainability and the like. The main superblock that I'm looking at is Frontier. In terms of my habits, I enjoy going out to the occasional party and socializing but I do also enjoy to bunker down and study in a quiet place whether that be a library or my dorm. IF you guys have any suggestions, they'd be really appreciated. TL;DR: Frontier Superblock vs Environment House LLC vs STEM Diversity House LLC. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> When I was a senior in highschool (3 years ago, am a transfer student at the U now as a junior), I took German through the U of M for two semesters, and both semesters I got a B. This is my first actual semester at the U, so obviously I don't have grades yet in any of my classes.  What's bothering me is that my GPA is a 3.00 from 3 years ago when I was in highschool and took German classes offered through the U. I guess what my question is, is there any way I can get a clean slate for my GPA, considering my current GPA is from 3 years ago? It's bothering me a lot because I don't want this current GPA to fuck up how it will turn out after this semester.  Sorry for the stupid question :/ Just had to ask. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This post might get me some flak but it is an observation that I have made about the student body here at the U. Bear in mind that I am one of you as well. I recieved my degree from NDSU, have a few close friends and family from Luther College, SDSU, and UW-Lacrosse. I have visited all 4 and lived in 1 of the colleges in the previous list. I have visited those campus multiple times and have stayed the night at those colleges over the weekend and also weekdays. This gives me a fairly good sample of campus life during lax and school days. One thing that I have noticed about the student body here at the U is that the majority is by an order of magnitude more serious or for a lack of a better word up-tight. Why is this? Is it the fact its a bigger U/College? Greater competition to make it passed \"benchmark years/classes\"?  Tuition costs arent the issue as a Luther student will end up paying 50K/yr room, board, and tuition.  Moreover, where and when can I see the less serious side of things the U' student body has to offer that wont bring about an \"Oh, heres a creepy 30 y/o guy trying to be young again\" social stigma thought? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Typing from my phone.  Sorry for typos. Mini background -- was a non traditional (22 year old) freshman at UMD. Super involved on campus (class president, u of m senate, other groups, etc.) I got sick and had to dropout after 2.5 years. Moved back to the cities with my (now) wife and after a 2 year break, I'm going back to school at the u of m twin cities starting this fall as a 26 year old marries guy.  The physical size of the campus worries me. Worried about convenience in terms of getting from one class to the next. As such, while I'm at my transfer student orientation tomorrow... I want to stick around and check out as much of it as I can. So what do I for sure need to know? What places should I definitely check out? I'm a polisci major and since I only have about 3 semesters left... the vast majority of my classes will be polisci. I assume/hope most polisci classes are in the same building? Is anyone else here in a similar situation as me? What questions do you wish you asked at the orientation?  Anyone here going to be at tomorrow's orientation or on campus at all and feel like grabbing a coffee and showing a newbie around? Shoot me a pm. I'll check throughout the day.

I don't have optical insurance and plan to order my glasses/contacts elsewhere, so I just need the exam done. Does anyone have any experience with places near or on campus?

            "<bos> hey i just got my financial aid package and im panicking just a little?  [this]([url link] page lists tuition as being 14760.00 and my assumption is that this is per semester, but that is such a large jump from the ~6,000 it was last year when I was a freshman. is this a correct assumption?  I am only going to get 13,532.00 a semester in my package, and 1,750 of that is work study(so only 11,782.00 will go towards the bill right away). I have a job that pays relatively well on campus and I have a little bit of savings, but not enough to pay the remainder of the bill (14k+everything else) off when it's due at the beginning of the semester.  It leaves me having to come up with about 3,000 out of pocket to pay my bill when September rolls around, plus whatever else will be on the bill, books, rent and food. I have 0 financial support from parents and thus the PARENT loan isn't an option.  I guess what I'm asking is if I'm completely misunderstanding this, or if I should start arranging to drop out. Sorry if it doesn't make any sense or doesn't belong here. I'll move it/delete it if so!   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! I am a VA senior in high school and I need help with my college decision! I am trying to decide between Virginia Tech and University of Minnesota. Virginia Tech has offered me a scholarship which covers the full cost of attendance for all four years and includes a $7,000 enrichment fund. University of Minnesota has given me scholarships that bring my total cost down to $12,000 a year. I was accepted to the Honors College at both schools. I want to study sustainable agriculture and international development. Both schools have Colleges of Agriculture, but UMN has a major that's closer to what I want (Food Systems) as well as a minor that I love (International Agriculture). I am a lesbian, and it is a top priority of mine that I feel welcome and accepted at college. A huge concern of mine is that VT may not be very liberal or accepting of who I am. I also want to make sure I have plenty of opportunities to do hands-on work in my field during college. Community outreach/projects, internships, study abroad, the whole shebang. I was thinking that UMN would have more of those kinds of opportunities than VT because of its location, but I'm not sure about that. I also don't know how well a degree from either VT or UMN is regarded in the professional field of agriculture, which I plan on going into after college. At the moment I am hoping to attend Cornell CALS for graduate school. My situation is even more complicated because I am going to be taking a gap year to live in Senegal on a State Department funded program. I will not be receiving college credit during that year. Right now I am thinking about deferring from Tech, but continuing to research UMN and possibly reapplying to the U while I'm in Senegal next fall. Basically, let me know what you think and give me reasons why I should choose UMN CFANS! I need every bit of information I can get! <eos> \n",

For me, it's a toss up between Raising Cane's in Stadium Village and Tony's Diner in Dinkytown. The latter beats the shit out of Mesa on a Friday/Saturday and there's never a line and the food's always good. The former just produces the most orgasmic food ever.  <eos> \n",

I took them because I thought they would qualify as writing intensive courses. Now I found out they don't count and now I am really bummed out(I now that was a super dumb move but I was mislead by someone). I have completed my General Eduction/MN Transfer Curriculum at a community college. I haven't applied for the College of Science and Engineering yet.

I've done a lot of research on new member fees and its something I can finally afford this year. Will any sororities be open to accepting a senior? Is it too late for me?

I do not have access to Moodle anymore, and they don't usually post the syllabi online publicly, so I was wondering if there's some new website or resource that the U has to allow alumni like me access to past course materials. Back up is just to email the professors, but I was just wondering if there's anything useful in place already.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Every semester or so I pop in here to see if there are any other CSGO. There are a couple reasons why I keep coming back to see if there are any new players. The first reason, is that it is fun to play with people from the U and maybe try to get some LAN parties going on during the school year. Right now we have a small community and it would be sick to make it bigger! The second reason I post here is because my team and I compete in a couple college leagues every semester and some of the team has graduated and so we need some fresh meat! There are two divisions for two of the collegiate leagues (NCeSPA and CSL), one for lower ranks, and one for higher ranks. The prize pool for division 1 in CSL is $50,000 this year! It would be great to get into both leagues this upcoming semester if possible. The third league that we compete in is AVGL (although I am not sure they are doing one this year).  All three of these are college only leagues and we actually took tied for 8th in two leagues, CSL and NCeSPA, and 3rd in AVGL, and I am confident we can do better with some new players! The final five have not been set for the division one team, so let me know! So feel free to join our [steam group]([url link] or [Facebook]([url link] and chat one of us up (I am BlubberNugget)!  If you are reading this and do not play CSGO but would like to, it is only 15$ and it is definitely a fun game! If you know people who play please recommend them to the steam group! Or if you don't play CSGO but want to join the group, do that too! I will probably be back here near the start of the next semester but until then, have a great first semester of the year! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm not sure how widely known this is, but an organization called College Works Painting is currently trying to recruit students at the U of M for the summer to work as \"interns.\" This internship forces students into managing kids painting houses for very low pay (it's a set pay for the whole summer, but if you take into account the hours, the pay is less than $5/hr). I met up with one of their recruiters, Tom, earlier today, and the whole thing felt very sketchy. He makes you read a very vague pamphlet and tries to convince you why painting houses and managing painters over the summer is ideal for \"leadership skills in the business place.\" Even had to fill out paper like its a worksheet to get his point across. How did I get in contact with them? They go around to different classrooms and pass out small sheets of paper for students to fill out their contact info, asking if they're interested in summer internships. They did this in my class about a month ago in Physics 1. If you get a call from them, decline the offer to meet up, or cancel any meetings with them you planned. And I repeat, DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING. This is one of the many scams that happens to college students. Tell your friends, especially freshmen and sophomores. They are much better off finding real internships in the Career Center this spring. They have all the tells of a scam including group interviews, promising high wages in the future, using the phrase \"work hard, play hard\", and being vauge about how you make money saying \"its complicated\". Do not fall for this scam. Interestingly they have an entire section of their website explaining why they aren't technically a scam. [Link]([url link] <eos> \n",

I have toured both campuses and loved both. I love the city feel of The U. I prefer it to FSU's campus. The problem comes down to money in the end. The tuition for me at The U is not cheap for my family, even though it is our instate school. At fsu the tuition may be 10,000 a year less, unless The U comes with a scholarship. The fafsa was not so nice to my family and projected way to much than my family can afford . I really would like to attend. I would like to know what you love about Minnesota, and what not so much. And if you think it is worth the extra tuition money.  <eos> \n",

I've never set foot in Erik's and had never heard of AX Paris until this morning. I suspect PayPal may be to blame for the AX email, but since the only retail-related application my U of M email address has is my PayPal account, I don't know how Erik's could've gotten my information unless 1) They searched the U's Directory, or 2) The U sold our email addresses.

I have the options of either middlebrook, centennial or university village for my accommodation. I am quite a social person and wouldn't mind attending regular parties etc. I was just curious as to what would be the best option of those 3 for what I am after. Also how do the meal plans and that work? Plus any further general advice I should be aware of. I want to fully immerse myself in the whole college life/atmosphere. Cheers  <eos> \", '<bos> I am considering taking Animal Diversity or Human Physiology.

However, his profile ([@jamesbmoen]([url link] and repos now give 404's. He seems to have left around the same time that Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, but he never struck me as someone who would just up and leave without so much as a note. Does anyone know if he said anything about it? UPDATE: I sent Moen an email! Here's the relevant part of his reply:  I deleted my Github site the day after I'd heard that Github was acquired by Micro$oft [...]. They have been historically hostile to free software in general and Linux in particular, and I suspect their purchase of Github is just the latest attempt to exclude these competitors.  [...]  I haven't moved Orson yet, so it's not available online, unless someone other than me has an old copy somewhere. I looked at some sites that seem to do the same thing that Github does, but I haven't made a decision about them.  [...]  I'll probably just get a faculty website from the CSci department here at UMN and put my code up there, if that's appropriate. If I do that, then you can get it through the CSci department website. This probably won't happen until Fall semester though. <eos> \", '<bos> Good evening **best** subreddit in the world! I am a freshman right now (Well I did PSEO at a community college so I have a little over 100 credits after summer semester, and I\\'m two years from graduation (Just switching to CSCI after making a stupid first major choice)) and this year I have been living at home due to the fact that I didn\\'t want to take out loans and I get scholarships to pay my tuition. The issue is that my mother suddenly told me she wants me to move out for fall, which means I\\'ll need to take out that one ~$5000ish dollar loan that\\'s offered on the FAFSA and use it to pay for housing. I\\'m a pretty frugal guy, and I would like insight for those who are in the know about how and if I can and should go about looking for housing, and what my cheapest option would be. I\\'m sure there\\'s someone I could talk to about this on campus, but everyone on reddit seems to know a lot (I\\'m gullible) and I\\'m sure a majority of you know about how on campus housing works from a consumer\\'s standpoint and will hopefully share your insight with me. My research so far has lead me to believe that my best bet would be to try and go with a double in Bailey or Centennial. I\\'m a pretty quiet, solitary guy, but I have no friends on campus, so I\\'m hoping I meet some people while I\\'m at it, but I also enjoy studying too. I also recently left a cult that was big into the no drugs/alcohol thing that I was in for awhile, so I kinda want to figure out what like \"night life\" or whatever is about but I think it might be a little freaky for me. So /r/uofmn, considering my predicament, do you have any advice for me? Do you think that this late into the gambit all hope is lost? Lol /u/OhBoyImScrewed go fuck yourself, find a gay sugar daddy instead?

Note that many professors have different tests and although they technically cover the same topics they tend to differ in how the questions are asked. They're better used for general understanding.

But overall I got a B+ in the course with an overall B- average for the class. Hopefully you will be able to pull some useful tips to solve problems and get a better understanding of phyiscs [Edit] Added my CSE MATH 1371  1372 with Chester Miracle to the dropbox. If you take Calc 1 or 2 with somebody other than Chester Miracle I've heard the tests and problems are wildly different, but if you have it with Chester Miracle then the test will be 95% similar with the same type of problems, just different numbers.

So, I am wondering if anyone has old furniture or a TV (must have HDMI hookup) that they would be able to drop off. I promise we are not creepy or anything, we just really don't have any better options at this point.  We are especially looking for chairs or recliners, a coffee table, and a decent size TV with HDMI hookup. We can pay you cash if you'd like as well.

The first question I have is about financial aid. I filled out my FAFSA a few months ago, and am mildly worried about the financial aid status on MyU showing that \"Step 2: To\\\\-Do Items\" is not completed yet. What could I be missing/am I missing anything at all? Second, when I go to the Degree Progress page of MyU, it shows that I have 11 credits \"in\\\\-progress\" rather than 16, which I have registered for. Since 5 credits are missing, I\\'m guessing it is excluding the Japanese language class that I registered for.

This is one of the busiest intersections on campus, especially during an event, so I realize that statistically, this would be the place where most accidents occur.

So far this week there has been three accidents, and I actually witnessed a hit and run a few weeks ago.

Rogers and B.F. Skinner at the University of Minnesota in Duluth. Specifically, the discussion mentioned in Rogers\\'s 1974 article *In retrospect: Forty-six years* on page 118. The only information Rogers gives is that it was at U of M, Duluth and that it was taped.

I will be attending this Fall. I am in a dilemma with housing. Back in January after I got my acceptance letter, I payed my enrollment fee and applied for housing. I applied to the CSE Transfer house as my first choice. My problem is that I could either dorm or drive from home. Pros of going from home: - Dont live too far from my home (20-35 min drive) -Save money from buying housing/meal plans(big one since I have to pay for school mostly on my own.) Pros of living on campus: - New experience - Help in adjusting to campus culture - Might make it easier to meet new people and make new friends(big one since I am very shy and have trouble making new connections) I really am having a tough time deciding. I found out I got a $3750 scholarship for two years, which helps a lot, but still makes the decision tough. Can anyone give me any advice as to what they would do in my situation?

I always hear that the places with houses are generally all students, but what does that really mean for you? Do you like see your next door neighbors at all? Is it possible to have to deal with loud house parties a lot or is that not really something you notice? Does the 10-15ish minute bus ride ever get annoying to you?

Polls are open Wed, 4/2 till Fri, 4/4. Vote online at vote.umn.edu. And here's my plug: I'm supporting Joelle Stangler and John Reichl for MSA President and Vice President. These two are the most qualified people there are for the position. They both have extensive experience working with campus administrators and the Board of Regents, and they have a great platform that covers tuition, financial literacy, sexual assault awareness, transportation, and more. Even better: they have the ambition to get it done. You can find their full platform, as well as a place to submit your concerns, at jjformsa.com. So why not their competitors? The other pair on the ticket is made up of two newcomers to campus - Abdisamed Awed and Miguel Morales. These two have a little political experience, but NOWHERE near the same clout and reputation among the administration as their competitors. Awed and Morales would be at a disadvantage when trying to get things done, and if they win, MSA will lose a lot of power it has built over the last few years through extensive lobbying. They also have a severely underdeveloped platform and have been unclear on a number of issues, or provided very general answers.

I have not timed how long it lasts, or the time between beeps, but neither one seems to have any regularity. Can someone please explain to me why this does what it does?? It's slowly driving me crazy! Edit: Asked a physics professor who lectures here, and he told me that it's because of the two clocks in the room. The beeping has something to do with them synchronizing with each other.  <eos> \", '<bos> I’m a high school senior who’s been accepted to the U and I’m looking for a roommate.

More or less, there's a lot of loopholes within policy and incredibly easy tricks to avoid getting into trouble. I'll gladly answer any specific questions you have in terms of policy, dorm life, and sticking under the radar. Spoiler Alert: There's very little power CAs have and there's very rarely a situation you'll be kicked out of the dorm. I had a guy who got arrested for a drug issue (not talking just smoking a joint, bigger) and he managed to stay in housing. And remember, your CA is probably brand new at the job, has only been in training for less than 2 weeks, is human, and guaranteed has no clue what they're really doing. We always tended to overlook those residents who treated us nicely and probably gave them a free ride for the year if they didn't screw up too badly.  <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm a reporter at the Minnesota Daily, and I'm looking for students who want to tell others what it's like to be on adderall, ritalin etc. I'm looking for students who have ADHD/ADD and students who don't but take the medication for it.

So I really enjoy class with Prof. Sturtivant. I've done fairly well in the class so far, but for the first time ever I'm extremely worked up about a final. I've heard mixed opinions about the difficulty of the 2011 final (I was hoping it'd be the same as the weekly quizzes) and at this point I'm not sure what to expect.

I'm wondering if anyone knows how necessary a cover letter is? Does it depend on the job? Do I hurt my chances by not having one?

It is a 6 bedroom house - 3 large bedrooms on each level - and each floor has a full bath. The house is located north of University Ave right off of Raymond - from visiting the area, the neighborhood seems nice. There is a washer and dryer on site and quite a bit of storage space. Rent is $333/month and we would ask that you place the same amount down for the deposit. The landlord has said in the past the utility expenses have been around $270/ month in total. There is a no smoking policy and a strict pet policy.  My roommates and I are relatively quiet people and are looking for someone who is relaxed and easy to live with.

Big chains (Pizza Hut/Domino\\'s) don\\'t count. Here are some reviews of the places that I\\'ve been to: **Punch Pizza:** My current favorite. Perfect portion size, plus their stuff is just straight up delicious. Soft  chewy crust, pretty traditional-style pizza cooked in a wood oven. Topping selection is solid too. Only gripe is that the cheese/oils/sauce are kind of slick and tend to run off the pizza if you hold it wrong. I opt to hold the slice folded in half, like a pizza taco. Verdict: 8.5/10 **Mesa Pizza:** Decent when sober, fucking incredible when wasted. Can be great sober if you order an entire pie instead of the \"by-the-slice\" option, since the slices tend to get left out for a while. Also, the Mac n Cheese pizza is usually lauded there. I thought it was underwhelming, but I was also sober when I had that, so your mileage may vary. Verdict: 4.5/10 w/ no alcohol  single slice, 7.5/10 w/ no alcohol  whole pie, 9.5/10 w/ alcohol **Blaze Pizza:** A relative newcomer to campus. Haven\\'t had a fresh one here yet, but there is a franchise in my home town that I ate at. It was pretty damn good, about as tasty as Punch but with a more average feel to it (not the super traditional old-style pizza). Especially good if you get a dash of sea salt on it. You\\'ll thank me later. Verdict: 8/10 **Pizza Luce:** Pretty good. Pizzas are solid; middle of the road crust, pretty great variety of pies, all-around pretty tasty. They\\'re pricy though. Just avoid the cheesy garlic toast, gave me the shits last time. It\\'s a great place to go out to eat if you have family in town that offer to pay for it. Verdict: 9/10 if you\\'re not paying for it, 6/10 if you are.

My logic here would be that: if I decided later in my career at U of M that I wanted to do graphic design, transferring into the 4-year program would be much more difficult than transferring out of it and into CLA. I figured if I transferred out of CDes into CLA, I would have already taken my lib ed requirements and maybe some additional art classes that could be applied towards my new major in CLA.

I badly fucked up my spring semester with PSEO courses and ended up getting A, C+ in AP Chem and World Affairs respectively at my suburban Minnesota public high school and then at RCTC D, F, F in 3 general ed courses. The people from the U I talked to as they rescinded my offer of admission were hopeful about my chances to transfer fairly quickly as I had completed 28 credits at RCTC in high school. I've spent a semester and a half at Minnesota State Mankato. First semester was a little rough not going to lie, between adjusting to life and Mankato as a party school. C+ in Philosophy 101, B+ in 4-credit History 250, D in Calc 1. This semester is going great now, with grades that after midterms look like I'll very likely finish with 29 post-HS credits, 57 overall credits: A - Health 101 3cr A - Health 240 3cr A - Sociology 294 3cr A - Urban Studies 150 3cr A- - Human Performance 330 1cr B - Chemistry 111 5cr These are also my current grades immediately after midterms. My extracurricular involvement includes pledging a fraternity fall semester (I dropped right before initiation when I decided to transfer and I've been accepted to Iowa State), a leadership position in Sociology Club, volunteering in setup and refereeing with Anthony Ford Pond Hockey charity tournament and Rake the Town and Rochester Festival of Trees, work experience of 2 years with Caribou Coffee, as well as attending the Midwestern Sociological Society annual conference in Minneapolis. I can get a shining letter of recommendation from one of the upper division sociology professors at Mankato. My responses to the essay questions will also be extremely strong, I got a perfect ACT writing score. My stats broken down a variety of ways would be 3.04 MSU GPA at the end of spring semester/if midterm grades are used (2.21 fall semester) 2.78 cumulative college GPA 57 credits, after this spring semester (2.47 with just fall semester 2017/39 credits overall) 32 ACT (not sure if that'll factor in) 3.2 overall HS GPA How likely is it that I get admitted to CLA for Fall '18 as a sociology major now or at the end of this semester? Should I wait until spring semester ends ~May 4 to send in my application, or ask them to consider my midterm grades?  <eos> \", \"<bos> If anyone is looking to join an awesome student group this year, Formula SAE is having a meeting for new members tomorrow night!

I couldn\\'t figure out why.  I visited with my advisor to figure it out, and it turns out that My U doesn\\'t show students which classes have reserved seating, and for whom. Although there were 8 seats open in the class I wanted, nowhere did it tell me the class\\'s remaining seats were reserved. My advisor had to check in PeopleSoft, a service students don\\'t have access to, to find that information. It\\'s a pretty lousy user interface for students trying to register. There should really be some sort of notice letting a student know a class has only reserved seating left. My advisor says he\\'s had quite a few confused students having the very same problem.  So if you\\'re having similar issues trying to register for an \"open class\" this fall, check with your advisor and try to find a back up. It\\'s probably reserved even though it won\\'t tell you.

I may be bringing a moped to campus this Fall and had a question about storage. My house doesn't have a garage (nor did I expect it to), so I was wondering what most people did with their mopeds once winter rolled around. Is there any cheap storage around?

My girlfriend is lonely from a lack of friends besides her live-in boyfriend. She\\'s shy and has little to no ego. She\\'s not aggressive at starting friendships, and frankly the opportunities don\\'t come around for her too often because of her personality (she isn\\'t a bad person, but she doesn\\'t get along with the average mind). I figured Reddit itself and especially the UofMN subreddit would be a nice place to put up a \"personal\" ad because of the type of people that frequent here (vs. the general population on campus). My girlfriend is a Computer Science major and a self-described \"gamer\" who plays mostly World of Warcraft. She can smoke a pot, drink an ethanol, and munch a shroom. She is turned off by superficial, egotistical, drama-seeking personalities which we feel the average girl is mostly composed of.

To do it I would need to push my graduation by a year probably, since it is a 6 month full time position.

I looked at the website and they do a terrible job of explaining what exactly is critical parking.

I have always found it difficult to talk in front of groups of people concerning any matter-it stems mainly from my social anxiety. In an effort to combat this, I thought maybe taking a public speaking class would help me.

On Friday, they broke in and stole two laptops, an iPad, and a backpack at 10 am (in broad daylight!). This morning at 9 am, I had someone come into my room and start digging through my belongings. He didn\\'t see me at first, but I confronted him before he ran away. The first break in was performed by two African American males, early 20\\'s. One was approximately 5\\' 9\" with a normal build, and unshaven face. The other male was approximately 5\\' 6\" with dreadlocks. The first male (5\\' 9\") was the one that was in my room this morning. He was wearing a grey hoodie sweatshirt and a green stocking hat. He did not steal anything this morning. I know it\\'s a long shot, but if you hear of these people trying to sell any of these items on craigslist or on the street, please PM me as soon as possible.

Abeer has created a climate where no one can voice their opinion without fear of being chastised unless it agrees with the agenda of the far left.

The theme for the course is \"Insects: The Good, The Bad, and the Bugly.\" It will cover how insects have influenced human society, and will touch on: * insects in film and literature * insect art * insects as perceived by cultures around the world * insects as food * pest insects * beneficial insects * and a bunch of cool insect biology (including kinky bug sex) My friend\\'s a phenomenal teacher, and the course syllabus looks really fun.

So I brought it in to the Coffman bookstore, seeing as it was the closest option, and here\\'s where the fun began. The guy behind the counter looked at it for about 3 minutes, noticed that two main screws were missing, and then informed me that the sockets were stripped, and that I would need to have a whole new keyboard panel ordered for roughly $250. At that point I was shocked with that price tag, so I asked if they had any of those small screws to just attempt to see if that would work. That was met with a stern \"No.\" I walked out the door, computer in hand, very frustrated with the experience. After some searching in some local computer stores I found the screws, put them in, tightened the other screws across the entire laptop, and what would you know it\\'s as good as new.  I then went back, with the screws out, inquiring about the same problem to see if maybe that one guy I got the first time was new or something. The second time I get quoted $310 for an entire repair. I then proceed to take out the screws, screw them in gently, and show him like magic my computer is fixed. They didn\\'t have much to say after that.  So, fellow Gophers, if you have any computer problems, try local computer repair places, or if it seems to be something somewhat simple like my problem, give it a shot yourself.

Is it practical, assuming you can ride one well? I thought about a bike, but thought it would be more of a hassle to store and maintain.

I’m looking for two, three or even four more students who are interested in living off campus for the next academic year. I’m not looking for graduate students in particular, and am open to living with undergraduates as well.  About myself; I’m patient, tolerant, pragmatic and cheerful. I would like to consider myself as tidy, but I’m definitely not a clean freak. I’m into Movies, Novels and Anime. I do spend a lot of time on video games, mostly RPG and Strategy games. Although I’m not much of a party person myself, I have no issues with drinking/smoking, as long as there is no smoking inside the house.  I would like to mention that I have not found housing yet. I’m hoping that I could find three or four roommates and we all could find a place near campus that best suits all our needs.

The college of liberal arts fared a little better, where Professor Eugene Borgida made $205,680. It seems the university does not recognize the importance of the art of design, but even worse, if you look at the college of science and engineering, it is clear the university has a completely inappropriate STEM bias, as Professor Frank Bates made $293,343. The university has claimed it believes in a liberal education. Did you know our school motto is, \"A common bond for all the arts\"? Yet, at the same time, it clearly holds a STEM bias. I petition that we end this bias and create a pay schedule based exclusively on experience (eg: 50yrs teaching makes more than 1yr teacher) and title (eg: regents professor makes more than adjunct professor) - not discipline (eg: CSE professor makes more than CDES professor). <eos> ', \"<bos> I'm taking it with Gregory Pawloski.  <eos> \", \"<bos> So... uh... how does one pay for tuition now with the new MyU system?

As the title suggests, I highly recommend that everyone should take CSPH 1001 sometime in your time at the U. I'm not a TA or anyone affiliated with the college, it just helped me so much through an incredibly stressful semester and I highly recommend it. It's offered online only, and is only 2 credits workload. The instructors care a lot about how you are doing and the grading is fairly easy. Each week the assignments are to learn about a new wellness practice, try it out, write about what you did, and take a short easy quiz to make sure you went over the principles. It covers really important wellness areas like coping with negative emotions, meditation, mindfulness, time in nature, wellness models, and tons of other things. The class discussions are a great way to talk through how you are doing and what the weekly practice is like for you. In my last very stressful semester I thought I was going to simply snap from the stress, but this class helped me learn how to move forward despite it.  It's full for Fall 2018, but if you have the opportunity to take it in the future I recommend it.

I've taken an intro to Chem course in high school freshman year and that's about all my experience. Taking the pretest I've had to look up most of it to be able to answer the questions. Overall, how difficult is 1061/65? I would like not to have to take 1015 because it would put me behind in terms of requirements. Just wondering if I'm going to have a tough time keeping up in 1061.

Due to financial reasons, I cannot afford to stay in Minneapolis and pay rent at my apartment. It will be nearly impossible to do so without a subleaser, as well, seeing as my loans will run out at the end of the semester. I was curious as to just how hard subleasing is. The details: I live in Sydney Hall. Yes, it is owned by Doran and yes, it is a full years lease. I actually really enjoy living here and would recommend the hall due to its proximity to campus. Anyways, I would rent from mid May to Sept 1st and would only charge for 3 months of rent. I pay around $525 a month for a SHARED bedroom. Obviously, I understand people do not want to pay the full price, especially for a shared room, so i'd drop rent to about $315 a month for those 3 months. I'm a male and live with another guy in my room and two females in the other. The other guy would also probably be subleasing, but there is no guarantee. I'm just curious, because I know a lot of people start placing their ads now. I'm worried about the situation already, and i'm really hoping someone is willing to pay that low rent to be so close to campus. I'm desperate to find someone, because I can not shell out $1500 in rent over the summer when I will be employed at home. For those of you who bash Doran: Sydney is actually a really nice hall. I've contacted the CEO of Doran and he has been very helpful with the process of either getting employed to earn some extra cash, or helping me find someone to sublease.

Bear in mind that I am one of you as well. I recieved my degree from NDSU, have a few close friends and family from Luther College, SDSU, and UW-Lacrosse. I have visited all 4 and lived in 1 of the colleges in the previous list. I have visited those campus multiple times and have stayed the night at those colleges over the weekend and also weekdays. This gives me a fairly good sample of campus life during lax and school days. One thing that I have noticed about the student body here at the U is that the majority is by an order of magnitude more serious or for a lack of a better word up-tight. Why is this? Is it the fact its a bigger U/College? Greater competition to make it passed \"benchmark years/classes\"?  Tuition costs arent the issue as a Luther student will end up paying 50K/yr room, board, and tuition.

I am trying to decide between Virginia Tech and University of Minnesota. Virginia Tech has offered me a scholarship which covers the full cost of attendance for all four years and includes a $7,000 enrichment fund. University of Minnesota has given me scholarships that bring my total cost down to $12,000 a year. I was accepted to the Honors College at both schools. I want to study sustainable agriculture and international development. Both schools have Colleges of Agriculture, but UMN has a major that's closer to what I want (Food Systems) as well as a minor that I love (International Agriculture). I am a lesbian, and it is a top priority of mine that I feel welcome and accepted at college. A huge concern of mine is that VT may not be very liberal or accepting of who I am. I also want to make sure I have plenty of opportunities to do hands-on work in my field during college. Community outreach/projects, internships, study abroad, the whole shebang. I was thinking that UMN would have more of those kinds of opportunities than VT because of its location, but I'm not sure about that. I also don't know how well a degree from either VT or UMN is regarded in the professional field of agriculture, which I plan on going into after college. At the moment I am hoping to attend Cornell CALS for graduate school. My situation is even more complicated because I am going to be taking a gap year to live in Senegal on a State Department funded program. I will not be receiving college credit during that year.

Thanks and be safe.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Anyone on here a part of the earth science program at UofMN? Or know anyone in it?  What are your thoughts on the program? It seems kind of large, which I don't mind. Is there a lot of funding? Lots of research opportunities?  I guess I'll keep my questions limited until someone comments.  Thank you in advance! :) <eos> \", '<bos> I’ve already registered for next year, and I’m about to fail one of my pre-reqs for those classes... do you guys think they will notice and un-register me? I’m worried bc if so, it’ll delay me a year and a half and I have nothing to take next semester.. just for one class.  <eos> ', \"<bos> Every semester or so I pop in here to see if there are any other CSGO. There are a couple reasons why I keep coming back to see if there are any new players. The first reason, is that it is fun to play with people from the U and maybe try to get some LAN parties going on during the school year. Right now we have a small community and it would be sick to make it bigger! The second reason I post here is because my team and I compete in a couple college leagues every semester and some of the team has graduated and so we need some fresh meat! There are two divisions for two of the collegiate leagues (NCeSPA and CSL), one for lower ranks, and one for higher ranks. The prize pool for division 1 in CSL is $50,000 this year! It would be great to get into both leagues this upcoming semester if possible. The third league that we compete in is AVGL (although I am not sure they are doing one this year).  All three of these are college only leagues and we actually took tied for 8th in two leagues, CSL and NCeSPA, and 3rd in AVGL, and I am confident we can do better with some new players! The final five have not been set for the division one team, so let me know! So feel free to join our [steam group]([url link] or [Facebook]([url link] and chat one of us up (I am BlubberNugget)!  If you are reading this and do not play CSGO but would like to, it is only 15$ and it is definitely a fun game! If you know people who play please recommend them to the steam group! Or if you don't play CSGO but want to join the group, do that too! I will probably be back here near the start of the next semester but until then, have a great first semester of the year! <eos> \", '<bos> Looking for a tutor incase i need help this summer. Inbox me availabilty and price per hour. Thanks. <eos> ', '<bos> I\\'m not sure how widely known this is, but an organization called College Works Painting is currently trying to recruit students at the U of M for the summer to work as \"interns.\" This internship forces students into managing kids painting houses for very low pay (it\\'s a set pay for the whole summer, but if you take into account the hours, the pay is less than $5/hr). I met up with one of their recruiters, Tom, earlier today, and the whole thing felt very sketchy. He makes you read a very vague pamphlet and tries to convince you why painting houses and managing painters over the summer is ideal for \"leadership skills in the business place.\" Even had to fill out paper like its a worksheet to get his point across. How did I get in contact with them? They go around to different classrooms and pass out small sheets of paper for students to fill out their contact info, asking if they\\'re interested in summer internships. They did this in my class about a month ago in Physics 1. If you get a call from them, decline the offer to meet up, or cancel any meetings with them you planned. And I repeat, DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING. This is one of the many scams that happens to college students. Tell your friends, especially freshmen and sophomores. They are much better off finding real internships in the Career Center this spring. They have all the tells of a scam including group interviews, promising high wages in the future, using the phrase \"work hard, play hard\", and being vauge about how you make money saying \"its complicated\". Do not fall for this scam. Interestingly they have an entire section of their website explaining why they aren\\'t technically a scam.

I am down to to The U and FSU. I am accepted into Carlson and intend on getting a bachelors in finance. I have toured both campuses and loved both. I love the city feel of The U. I prefer it to FSU's campus. The problem comes down to money in the end. The tuition for me at The U is not cheap for my family, even though it is our instate school. At fsu the tuition may be 10,000 a year less, unless The U comes with a scholarship. The fafsa was not so nice to my family and projected way to much than my family can afford . I really would like to attend. I would like to know what you love about Minnesota, and what not so much.

I've never set foot in Erik's and had never heard of AX Paris until this morning. I suspect PayPal may be to blame for the AX email, but since the only retail-related application my U of M email address has is my PayPal account, I don't know how Erik's could've gotten my information unless 1) They searched the U's Directory, or 2) The U sold our email addresses. Anyone have any insight on the issue? <eos> \", \"<bos> In case you got the email and were wondering.. there's an entrance fee of $70.

            " I'm in Animal Diversity right now, but I've never taken Physiology so I can't make any comparisons for you. Animal diversity is a bit more work than a 2 credit course, but if you can memorize well, then you'll find it very easy. Tests are very straightforward; no multiple choice. Part of it is a lab practical, where you look at something and there's a pin stuck in a structure that you need to identify. Other questions are short answer that are about things that you straight memorize or about things that are about evolution or about a certain species. Personally, I love the course even with its heavier study load. I think the grading is very fair and I'm learning things that are important to my future with healthcare.  \n"

[url link]    I would definitely advise everyone to stop trying to walk to the West Bank after dark. The West Bank is free. The East Bank is the same, and if you're a guy, you are on your own. I took both. I took it with Normandale and he was fantastic. I took it at the U. He's super chill though, and I\n",
            "Reference COMMENTS: I got super into rock climbing this past school year and would say that the Minneapolis wall is definitely worth it. If you are not completely sold on climbing yet, you can rent the shoes there, which helps to ease into it, rather than investing even more. If you already own shoes the St. Paul gym is worth a visit, but its is much smaller overall, and you are not allowed to top rope when you go. Therefore if you are interested in top roping, Minneapolis is for sure the way to go. The bouldering wall is about 2 feet shorter at St. Paul (just guessing), and also gets changed once at the end of the semester versus Minneapolis getting changed multiple times throughout the semester. Also the people and culture at the Minneapolis wall is much more lively, often times at St. Paul you could go and not see anyone the entire time you are there.  \n"
