However, I've run into a particular problem while scripting in python in a personal project. I was wondering if anyone knew a way I could get help on campus with python, preferably face to face. If anyone reading this is confident in their abilities and is willing to try and help via this post that would be great too. I've tried looking into it on sites like stackoverflow but I'm still struggling to find a solution. <eos> \n",

Does anyone know if this will be a problem? i.e. if the professor takes attendance? Will he record lectures on boilercast and put them online like some professors do? I know, ask my advisor, but I was wondering if there's anyone here who's taken it who can shed some insight as well <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey, so I survived my first semester at Purdue, now I'm wondering about next semester and textbooks.  * 1) Should I email the professor and ask if we're actually going to use the textbook recommended on MyPurdue?(Or would that be rude) * 2) How long should I wait before stalking Amazon for the best prices on my textbooks, because I know I'm going to need at least one? * 3)Should I wait till school starts and then risk not having textbooks for the first few weeks? I'm taking SPAN201, WGSS280, PSY201, PSY367, and PSY272 <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! I was admitted to Purdue's MS program in Aerospace Engineering (AAE), and am very excited about the opportunity. I was flown out for a graduate recruitment event in February, met with a few professors in my area, and generally had a great time. I think Purdue is the best program for me. However, I was not admitted with an assistantship and was not offered one after the recruitment event. When I spoke with professors, they indicated that: 1. Most incoming MS students are not offered TA positions, since they are based on research performance during the first semester. 1. There are other opportunities in other departments (Math, Eng. Ed.) but they are hotly contested. 1. You can get a job as a graduate assistant on campus that will waive tuition and provide a stipend, but these are also hard to get. I recently received a 1/2 time TA offer from Penn State beginning on arrival, which would cover tuition and provide a stipend. I really want to attend Purdue, and have applied for assistantship positions with Math, Eng. Ed, and Armstrong Hall, but won't learn if I've been picked for any of them until after the April 15th deadline. Do any of you know what kind of outlook an incoming MS student has when it comes to securing funding? If I knew that I stood a good chance at getting it for my 2nd semester onwards, I think that would be enough to remove all doubts about accepting Purdue's offer of admission. Purdue's website says that 65% of AAE graduate students are funded, but I don't know what percentage of MS students contribute towards that number. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I am graduating from high school early this December and am enrolled at Purdue for my spring semester. I have applied for housing and a roommate, and will find out where I am living in early December. I have a few questions about enrolling in the spring. 1. Housing opens back up on January 6th, will I be able to move in to my dorm even if my roommate is still home for Christmas break? 2. How is it in the winter and will I need anything specifically for winter besides proper clothing? 3. What is proper shower etiquette? Do I take a new set of clothes to the showers with me? Walk back to the room with a towel? What do I carry my soap and stuff in? Do I need shower shoes? Just curious not worried about it.  4. How hard is it to use the Kitchenettes in the dorms? Thanks for any replies, I am looking forward to going to school this spring. <eos> \n",

I'm newish to the area, so I'm not sure of the best times for night life. Any input is welcome, thank you! <eos> \n",

Unfortunately the tag for my mattress has been ripped off so I cannot tell which side is which. The airholes for the mattress is a good identifier, so could you please tell me if the firm side is closer to the airholes or farther? Thank you <eos> \n",

She weighs about 25-20 lbs of solid muscle. She is very good with other dogs and loves people and is extremely cuddly. I am fostering her for the summer from Natalie's Second Chance no kill shelter and she is ready for a permanent home. I have been trying all summer to convince my landlords for next year to allow me to keep her but they are strictly pet free. She is also current with her rabies shot. (got it in May) Feel free to ask any questions that you can think of. I can also add more picture upon request. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I fell in love with math my sophomore year in high school. I had previously hated it when I was a kid, but something about the order of everything and the rush of enlightenment drew me nearer. A little back story, I grew up in Canada and finished high school in Northwest Indiana. The way the curriculum worked in Canada was a little different than the American system, so I never had the chance to take algebra one in Grade 8. So throughout high school I was stuck with the usual Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and Pre-Calculus classes (all of which I had very well succeeded in - around 100% for each class). Now I am a freshman at Purdue currently enrolled in MA161, but I am starting to feel a little overwhelmed. Engineering and Science has always been my dream, but I am afraid I will not survive in this class and/or not enjoy college. Is MA161 possible without any previous Calculus knowledge? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Initially I did get into Purdue, but I Decided to take CAP UT Austin, which means I go to a different UT system school and then move into UT Austin starting 2nd year. This was cool but I hate my 1st year school so much that Im regretting and honestly Im reconsidering Austin in general. So before I start writing my transfer to other schools can you talk to me about Purdue, and the midwest. like where are people from? whats the campus life? Party life? Things to do in Lafayette? etc And specific to me - Im interested in Purdue mostly because Chicago is nearby (was born there, but never lived there), 2 hour drive is nothin for me, most cases I can cut it in half.  Would it be a real stupid idea to come to Purdue just to recconect with my birthplace??  I do have a place to stay with family friend so it just could work out Thanks  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everybody, I did a preliminary search on this sub and couldn't find any information about this topic, but I have a slight hangup when trying to get a parking permit online. I'm getting a res hall permit, and the website asks for a \"Delivery Option\" that says  Select campus delivery below. Please allow time for delivery. Do not park in permit required areas until your permit is received and properly displayed. However, it only lists my permanent address and old dorm addresses. Because it says \"campus address\" I'm assuming I can't pick my permanent address. Also, when I click \"add\" for a new address, I can only change my email and my phone number. What gives? <eos> \n",

My GPA is crap, and I realized that Purdue (despite the kindness everyone here has showed me) is not the place for me. Is there any way to get my records cleaned, so that I can start fresh at some other college, get my act together without having to mention exactly how terrible I did here? <eos> \n",

I have never met people that are interested in fashion in the same capacity as me. It would be awesome if someone at Purdue just happens to be into this too! I am interested in fashion blogging/journalism and sustainability if that helps you gauge my level of interest in fashion? Speaking of which, what are your guy's thoughts on people that are interested in fashion? After living in Indianapolis for most of my life, the art/fashion scene seems so small (but it is growing), and it seems like most people trivialize fashion. Not to say that it is super important or that it should be treated as some sort of academic discipline, but I'm assuming people don't understand why people are interested in it. Is it weird to dress up/weirdly? Is it weird to dress up/weirdly *at Purdue*? What are your thoughts on people that do? Etc. :-) <eos> \n",

I chose pharmacy 2 years ago because everyone was saying it was such a good degree and pharmacists are in high demand, but now demand is equaling supply. Since Purdue is one of the top 10 pharmacy schools I'm hoping it wouldn't be hard for me to find a job, but I don't know how bad the job market will be in 2019.  Can you please share any of your fears/thoughts on the situation? Thank you. <eos> \n",

McKenna shoots for the stars and Chrissa stands strong are my two favorite movies right now, but I am always open to watching new ones!  Any other men here who also like American Girl? Maybe we can form a club or just informally meet up, chill, and watch some American Girl over the weekend. We can each take turns purchasing popcorn from Tarkington Market and I can pop it since there is a microwave in my room.  It'd be lit if I found some American Girl pals to chill with <eos> \n",

I am currently a part of Engineers Without Borders, and it is something that I have become really passionate about. I feel that my ultimate career goals lie in this realm, but I am unsure of the path that I should take. What type of engineering would be most suitable for this type of work? <eos> \n",

I'm not 100% set on what I want to do yet so I was thinking of putting CE possibly instead of CS to increase my chances of getting in. The fields overlap some and they both get somewhat similar jobs, so I'd be fine with a CE degree. I have a 35 ACT and a 4.00 GPA so I have a good shot at being admitted but I think I screwed myself by thinking of Purdue as more of a backup. Thoughts? <eos> \n",

I am a Lafayette local, and I have been going to watch the Purdue Jazz Band play since I was a young tyke, and it has been a dream of mine to play in that band. I plan on auditioning to get into it. I'm a drummer who is pretty decent (I think so at least ;__;). I've had experience playing with jazz combos around town, have won golds at state solo and ensemble, and I regularly practice a variety of styles as well as improvisation. With all of this in mind, can anybody give me advice on what I should prepare for/expect if I audition to play in Purdue's jazz band? I understand that it is rare for a freshman to play in this band and I don't have my hopes up but I figure it's worth a shot. Might as well try! What is the audition process like? What will I have to play? What can I do now to prepare? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I graduate on Saturday along with thousands of others who deserve it. (At least I got it before 30) Graduating means stepping out into the real world and shining. Being someone who is introverted, I don't really step out there like all the other students here. While they are all out contacting mentors and teachers, I sat and did my studies. I am not saying that college has not helped me but there is a disconnect that I see here. There are countless students here that brag about where they are headed to and I feel worthless. That scares me. I will be alone, worthless under a bridge and homeless. No friends to help me. I can't even talk to a girl without stuttering. I don't want to be alone, that is my greatest fear.  Any advice? Thanks in advance.  <eos> \n",

I managed to pick up an iPhone over the summer, so I was wondering - is there a way to add mymail's mail server to the iPhone? I know some folks forward mail to gmail, but I was wondering if there was a more direct way. Google couldn't help - maybe you folks can.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I used to see him every morning sitting there next to the boarded up windows in the old Subway building on Northwestern and State. Does anyone know anything about this guy? Has anyone even tried talking to him? I gave him McDonald's breakfast one morning.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm going to be starting college this fall as a freshman. I got accepted to Purdue for Computer Science, but as of ten minutes ago, I'm going to be attending else where. It kinda felt bad to send in my withdrawal email, because Purdue did seem like a really awesome and cool place. I'm thinking... if that's how I feel at the end of the year, I'll put it an application to transfer. Is it hard transferring to Purdue after first year? Anything I need to know? (If you need to know, I'll be an international student, coming in from Canada. I have taken the SAT, so I have those scores, and I got in the EA round this fall for freshman year. Does that make any difference to my application?) <eos> \n",

I tried using them through Purdue's VPN in order to circumvent this, but the websites still know that I'm in Japan somehow. Anyone know why this is? Is this something to do with how Purdue's VPN is configured? <eos> \n",

Do you guys know any place that would satisfy? The closer it is to Purdue the better, but we are willing to drive ~30 minutes, or even to Indy if it's really, really good. Thanks a lot, really appreciate it!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am a senior in Computer Engineering. I am looking for Civil Engineering or any other construction related majors (preferably junior and seniors) to have a discussion with. I have this startup idea in mind. It involves construction and artificial intelligence. I am interested in knowing your inputs (more interested in the negative inputs actually) about my idea. Maybe we could even work on this together if our interests align. My idea mostly involves AI, pre-fabrication, automated surveying, high speed and error free construction of multi-floored houses, large buildings, etc. Let me know if any of this sounds interesting to you. We could probably grab coffee and talk at the Union or Greyhouse or whatever library you want.  Send me a private message. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys! So I'm a sophomore whose a semester behind in ECE and in order to catch up since I have a lot my gen ed credits, I decided to take MA 261 and MA 265 together, since they could be taken concurrently. I'm also taking ECE 201, ECE 207, and PHYS 272. My adviser emailed me saying that because my GPA is below a 3.0 (it's a 2.8 right now), that I should strongly consider waiting to take 265 and to take a gen ed instead.  Is taking 261 and 265 doable? My old adviser said it was fine but I got assigned a new one and she's concerned. I just don't want my GPA to drop anymore but don't want to stay a semester behind either. Any advice?  <eos> \n",

For people who had accomodations and were forced to stay and finish the exam, congrats, you wasted your time (also, the proctors will probably undergo safety training again since the coordinators were not happy to hear that some students were not sent to a safe area). There is currently no plan to retake the exam (the department is struggling to make a new exam, find a space, and make accomodations with such a short time window). \"If you are ever in an exam when a safety issue occurs, you are allowed to leave to seek shelter. The dean of students will always back you up.\" - Stephanie Foster <eos> \n",

I can't take the advanced credit exam because it clearly states that I can't have taken the class but on Purdue's website for CLEP, there are no such requirements <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Fuck these exams jesus christ. Rather than actually testing your knowledge and competency with any modicum of respect, the exams are written to play fucking tricks with your mind. They take what you know and subvert it, twist it, confuse it, in a maelstrom of a question that resembles nothing you’ve seen in the book or homework before; where you get no partial credit whatsoever — knowing 90% of the topic but not quite recalling one bit and guessing wrong means you actually know 0%. Fuck.  Fuck.  <eos> \n",

If the [live construction map]([url link] is to be believed, parking lots are to be built at the following locations: * The 500 block of Russell and Waldron, except for 507 Ministries. This is the current location of Brownstone. * The lot of 3 houses on the northwest corner of 6th St and Waldron, south of Cochran Apartments and east of the old Latino Cultural Center. * The current location of Lambda Chi Alpha on the southeast corner of 6th St and Waldron.

I've tried to coalesce some of the reflections I've had on my college experience and thinking about advice I would give myself if I was starting all over again. Several articles will likely follow. These are things that I wish I knew. Maybe someone else starting their journey will find it useful.\u0003\u0003 Any comments, feedback and criticism is welcome. Boiler up! [url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I am a current second semester freshman intending to get a degree in BME with a minor in ECE, to have experience with microfluidic chip design. BME has a slightly different set of required classes for the ECE minor than other majors. The first course that BME is required to take in ECE for a minor is 255, but it has a pre req of 201. Does this mean I need 201 before I take 255? 201 is not included on the course list for the minor. Thanks <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey I have a question about ME 463. I know that it is required for graduation to complete a senior design course, but I was wondering if there were any alternatives. For example, today I heard that ChemE's could be part of the Soy Competition as an alternative to taking the senior design class and that EE's could do Epics as a Senior Design Alternative. Is there anything that you guys have heard of for ME's? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Any PP2's or PP3's on here? How are your interviews going? Curious if anybody has any info on the makeup of the interview pool. Number of PP2, PP3, Purdue students? BIOL 301 knocked a lot of people out of the running, but I haven't received a solid number. There are currently somewhere south of 180 PP2 applying is all I can say for certain. No idea how many PP3's are reapplying.    The current application pool is the 2017 group. If you want some stats from the last two years I've got them. Accepted in 2015 were 82% Purdue pre-pharm (124 out of 151 accepted, 189 West Lafeyette applicants total). Accepted in 2016 were 81% Purdue pre-pharm (122 of 152, 171 West Lafayette applicants). Definitely a strong bias toward those who did their pre-pharmacy at purdue. Acceptance rate for PP3's is said to be somewhere around 65%, but I can't find my original source to confirm. Average GPA in both years was north of 3.5 as is expected.  The statistics don't give a breakdown as to who received interviews. What is known is there were 570 applicants in 2015 and 489 in 2016.   Out of state applicants are pretty well out of luck. 2016 had 4 out of 258 out of state applicants enter the program.    Hopefully these favorable statistics have made things a bit less worrisome for you. Try not to think about it for the next month. Focus on classes. If you do get accepted, you don't want to fail biochem and get knocked off. That's where the waiting list gets its chances from after all. Best of luck. If you've got any other stats, rumors, info, or encouragement post up. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys! So in the past day or two, I finally became comfortable with my schedule this semester, and stopped resorting to checking my phone in between every class. However, waking up today, I realized I'm not as slick as I thought I was, as I had completely forgotten about that CGT 163 lecture I definitely skipped on accident yesterday. Are there any online resources or another way possible just to know what happened in class yesterday. I'm content with YouTube tutorials, just need to know what he ever covered. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Logged into the Purdue Parking page using the citation number to see if the email had been legit and sure enough - there was a citation for $35. The best part? I don't have a car. Hell, I don't even have a license, and I haven't been on Purdue's campus since May. Anyone know how likely they are to believe my appeal stating there is no way this citation can be linked to me? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Fellow Boilers I'm back at purdue for another degree, MBA this time, and I figure some others of you are looking for some new opportunities.  I've been toying with creating some interactive sports electronics for some time now, and I brought the idea to a startup weekend and won first place in the competition. Now I'm looking to dive further into it, but would like some help. I'd like to find a couple electrical engineers and designers who are excited about physical product design and, perhaps to a lesser degree, web/app design.  I know there's gotta be something in it for you to want to help, so let me know what you're after (cash, a fun product for your class writeup/thesis, joining the startup scene, just testing your technical skills, etc). Let me know what you're after and what your skillsets are and I bet we can make something work.  Also, another perk, I have access to MatchBox coworking space for myself and my whole team, so we have space to work. It's not far from campus, if you've never been, definitely worth checking out.  As always Boiler Up  Edit: spelling   <eos> \n",

I like Nintendo games, DnD, and longboarding if that helps. And to make this thread less sad and pathetic, post some stories about the most awesome friendships you guys have cultivated on campus. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, I just found out I failed a non - major relrelated course this past semester, and I'll be graduating in the spring, so retaking it is not an option. I wouldn't be freaking out about it so much if I wasn't applying this spring to grad school here within my major. I did have some personal issues this semester that might have impacted the course a lot. That, coupled with the fact that it wasn't a major requirement so it lost priority to classes that were. I've emailed the professor to meet next week and talk about possibly redoing the final paper for a better grade if that is an option.  In the meantime, does anyone here have experience with grade appeals and how they work, deadlines, etc? <eos> \n",

Introduction, conversation topics, etc. I've had a few good experiences with recruiters but it isn't often enough, so I'm trying to nail down a more solid plan for approaching and speaking to recruiters. I have work experience, my GPA is above requirements, I'm always a leader on my projects. How do I translate this into getting an interview? I've seen way too many times engineers just plopping their resume into a recruiters hands and going through it. It's shitty and has never been successful for me.

            "<bos> I'm going to be majoring in CS, which requires going up to Calculus 3 and a linear algebra course at minimum.  My HS's AP Calculus AB teacher wasn't a particularly good one. However, **I will receive direct credit for Calculus 1 at Purdue (MA 16500) since my AP Calculus AB class is dual credit via a regional campus. I'm going to get an 'A' in that class and therefore on my Purdue transcript.** My dilemma is that I'm not sure if I should retake Calculus 1 or go straight into Calculus 2. I looked over [past years' MA 16500 final exams]([url link] and I can answer most of the questions, except for the ones involving: * series * ellipses and hyperbolas (focuses, vertices, etc.) * inscribed shapes ([such as #16 on the 2012 final]([url link] My teacher allows my class unlimited usage of calculators (both graphing and scientific) on every assignment/quiz/test/exam. Because of that, I've used my calculator as something of a crutch in the sense that I didn't bother to memorize the unit circle (or memorized how to derive it); therefore I couldn't tell you what sin(pi/2) is (I do know that pi/2 is 90 degrees though). During Precalculus/Trigonometry, I remembered it. So, I shouldn't have that much trouble re-memorizing it. I also used to know everything about ellipses and hyperbolas in Algebra 2.  I think I'm pretty good with derivatives and integrals (the two major themes of Calculus 1). I'm not sure why it gets taught in AB calculus, but I know most of the stuff about 'revolving the intersection of two functions around an arbitrary axis to find the volume'.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was wondering if anyone had ever used the Purdue University Airport for personal flights? I wanted to try to get my girlfriend a flight from the airport to the airport or back from the airport to another none -commercial airport (Findlay Ohio) Would this be possible? If not does anyone know what the regulations for flight are, and how you could fly someone back and forth more easily? This would be great as flying it would be like 40 minutes from west Lafayette to findlay ohio but driving is closer to 3 hours. - she doesn't have a car (or license for that matter) and it'd be nice to be able to use this <eos> \n",

I **know** there are online resources (Links in similar posts in this same subreddit), but I was really looking for a good book that explains it easily, as I have a hard time understanding the course book as well. I am only looking for a book that explains the material in a way that is applicable to the test. If anyone has any suggestions from experience, please help. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Back in December I signed a lease with Granite Management for a studio apartment that I can no longer afford. It's for a studio apartment at [Ananda apartments]([url link] at 1010 N Salisbury St, just a few blocks from Purdue's campus. The Lease goes from August 9th, 2013 to July 31st, 2014 and rent is $475 a month. The deposit is also $475, and the only utilities that aren't included are electric, cable, and internet. One thing to note is that rent payments start on June 1st, 2013 and end on May 1st, 2014. My current lease runs until the end of July 2013, so I would have to be paying two rent payments a month during the summer, which is why I can no longer afford the new lease. <eos> \n",

Students will also need a 3.0 overall GPA in order to be guaranteed a CODO spot. Lower requirements will be considered for CODO if spots remain. They're still discussing whether there will be a guaranteed CODO at all. Talks will be held in mid-May to discuss this further. Edit: Correction they need a A- in CS180 <eos> \n",

The results are that Friday and Saturday finish in a dead heat. This and the fact that about half of the boilermakers are 21+ we are going to shoot for 2 meetups. A friday night at the bars, and a saturday afternoon for everyone. The next problem(s) is that 40 people responded and with 636 subscribed I think we can count on a large amount of people showing up. So I don't know a place where we can host this. Buffalo Wild Wings might be big enough, if not we could get a lecture hall or go to a park. I don't know how to reserve a lecture hall and if we go to a park people would need to bring food (survey said food was important). ** Recap ** Friday (Sept 16) Night 21+ Bars, starts at Nine Irish 9pm ends at ??? Saturday (Sept 17), show up after the game, location: Boiler Market <eos> \n",

I'm in CS182 (discrete math) this semester, and I'm having a tough time in this class. I don't really like the style of teaching, and I find the lectures extremely disengaging and dry. The lecturer has an accent which is difficult for me to understand, so I don't really get too much out of the lectures. For those of you who have taken CS182, do you have any tips to doing well in this class? Did you use any online material (something like khanacademy)? Do you recommend attending the PSO sessions? (My TA has a thick accent, so I personally didn't find it too useful :/) Thanks! <eos> \n",

It was originally designed for students of my own school (Northeastern University), but I recently added a handful of other schools, including Purdue. Briefly, what it does is notify you at the exact moment a spot opens up in a previously full class section. With this service you would be able to be the first student notified and be able to log in and register for that class before anyone else. So check it out and let me know what you guys think!

            "<bos> Hi all, this is my first post so go easy on me!  This upcoming spring I plan to take an easier course-load to prepare for the dental admission test (DAT) which I will take in May. So far for the spring I am planning on taking a total of 13 credits. However, 9 of these credits are BIOL 286 Introduction to Ecology and Evolution, BIOL 241 Genetics and Molecular Biology (which I have heard is crazy hard) and CHM 256/25501 Organic Chemistry 2 with lab. My question is whether or not this schedule would be counter-productive. My plan was to take an easy course load but I have heard that these classes are really rigorous. I'm torn because I feel like these courses could help with studying for the DAT but I don't want to risk my GPA either. Does anyone have any experience in these courses? Is taking all 3 a bad idea when I am trying to prepare for the DAT at the same time? <eos> \n",

Can any engineering students pursuing a minor or second major weigh in on the difficulty? I like the idea of doing an astronomy minor or something like that. Or perhaps something practical like computer science. I understand that double majoring in engineering would take longer than 4 years. How difficult is it to maintain a good GPA? Preferably 3.5+? Are employers aware that Purdue doesn't practice grade inflation? Is job placement okay? I'd want to go back to California after getting my degree.  Is the cost of attendance a good estimate? Are people awarded scholarships after their first year? Does cost of attendance increase each year? (I read that tuition has been frozen for the past few years). And finally, would it be a terrible idea to commit to Purdue without having visited? Anything I should know before going in blind? Sincerely, a kid who has lived in California for most of their life.  Thank you guys for reading.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Okay so I live at hilltop and I am having roommate problems. Like I have two roommates, one is a really good friend, lets call her G, and the other is barely an associate, lets call her Z. But we all went to high school together. I did not want to room with Z because something was telling me that I would hate living with her, but I wanted to room with G. And apparently G and Z wanted to room together because they are the same majors. G talked me into rooming with her and Z. Um, it was going okay at first. Like I could tell how strict Z was and how she gets an attitude really quickly, but it really didn't bother me. But we just had a crazy argument, I will take the blame because I am an adult, and I won't keep whining and making a big deal like Z. I need out of this apartment because it's stressing me out. I don't even want to come home sometimes. But I guess my question is: how do I switch roommates/residences if I live in an apartment? And how soon can I get the hell out of there? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So the professor in one of my upper division Krannert classes is supposed to follow a curve where the bottom 5% of the class gets below a C. However, he let the class vote on a curve that now allows more A's and puts the bottom 10% of the class under a C. My question: if a student who would have originally passed the class with a C has to retake it now because the professor deviated from the Krannert curve, could that student dispute his/her grade? <eos> \n",

He does not do his laundry or wash his sheets. It has gotten to the point that I thought our room had mold in it, so i washed every article of clothing I own, my sheets, pillowcases, etc. Still stinks. Often times my girlfriend will refuse to come over because he smells so bad. It is beginning to affect my life negatively. What can I do to bring this up without being rude? I have already complained to my RA, to no avail. I am a freshman staying in a residence hall, you guys know how small and cramped they are. Anyone have any advice as to how to deal with this?  TLDR: Roomate smells, doesn't shower. How can I politely tell him to shower and maintain personal hygiene?  Thanks <eos> \n",

Every day there'd be some lively back-and-forth going on between the readers, and the editorial board themselves would often throw out an opinion that would get people fired-up to discuss I'm back now for grad school, and every time I crack open an Exponent now, I find the Opinions page to be mostly empty. Worse still, the opinions put forward by the editorial board are mostly meh-level at best, and don't really invite discussion.

I'm not good at sciences like anatomy and biology because I'm bad at just straight memorizing things. I'm more a chemistry person where I can apply laws and do math more.  Also, does anyone know the difference between CHM 11100, 11200, 11500, 11600 and 12500? Does it just get harder as the numbers go up? <eos> \n",

However, 3 years in, and I'm miserable and hating every second of it, with me having done terribly last semester. I'm looking to switch, and unsure about what to switch into. I know it'll take more time to graduate, but that's okay, 5 years seems to be the norm at Purdue.  I was looking into CGT or anything of the sort, since I actually enjoy designing on computers and applications. I've also thought about IE since it would be an easy switch with easier workload (but it's certainly not what I want to do).  Any advice on what would be a good major to transfer into would be helpful. Thanks... <eos> \n",

I thought that I could rank the dorms I liked best but, instead, I found out that I need to rank my preferences by room type. This worries me a little because of prices. I would really like to go to Hawkins or Hillenbrand but I ranked suite w/ AC second which implies that I could get selected for Third Street Suites which is more expensive than Hillenbrand. Plus, I would like a dorm w/ a bathroom. How does this work??? I'm a little worried.  <eos> \n",

He was running back and forth and almost got hit a few times but all the cars on the street stopped, a few people opened their doors trying to get him to come to them and a few people on the sidewalk helped me corral him back to safety.  I am incredibly grateful to everyone who stopped their cars when they saw a dog and a distressed girl chasing the dog. It made me proud to be a boiler maker to see everyone help me.

They sent an officer over and using equipment of crew working nearby, managed to cut the thief's U-Lock.  I asked whether the police would do anything to catch the guy who did this. She said she would look at the footage from the security cameras installed around Cary Quad and try to identify the person. If they do, they'd give me a call, but added that chances are pretty slim. Thanks again, everyone, for the excellent suggestions. I hope info here helps other students in safeguarding their bikes.    Original message:  Will miss it forever. Got stolen at Hawkins Hall sometime last night. If anyone finds it or has any information, please let me know :(   It was registered with PUPD and I reported it stolen this morning, but I don't know how much they're going to act on it.

Further up the street about 20 feet. Someone was in the middle of the street. In the dark, without anything reflective on.  I see this all the time on campus of all hours of the day, people on foot, and on bicycle ignoring the Don't Walk signs. Especially at University and State, and State and Grant.  I know how pedestrians say that bicyclist are dangerous out there on campus, but this is just as bad, if not worse.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, Boilermakers! I am currently a sophomore studying in CAU (China Agricultural University) in the specialty of Environmental Engineering. I completed my application for ENRE (Environmental  Natural Resources Engineering in Agricultural  Biological Engineering Department) program of the Fall semester on February 25. There are a few red flags that make me hesitant about it. First, courses associated with engineering between U.S.A. and China is a little different and I'm confused if I could satisfy the strict first-year course requirements in Purdue. Secondly, my present GPA (3.49) and TOEFL score (92) are not very high and I'm not sure how much weight my grades carries in the application process. Third, the deadline (April 1) for the fall semester application is coming and I am wondering how long Purdue will give me a response. These concerns have caused me to ask you all that have participated in ENRE or ABE what was your experience like and how long did it take for your response? Is the ENRE application very competitive for international transfer students like me?  Thank you so much for your help! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Congratulations you are a freshman at Purdue. You worked hard to get here and now you have to work even harder to stay here. Times will get tough, but just remember you are a Boilermaker and every other student here has been in the same situation you are. Push through it. The Ten Commandments:  For fucks sake don't say \"I'm a sophomore by credit\" etc.  Thou shall not wear thy BGR lanyard after BGR is over.  Study hard but don't forget to have fun.  Get to know your professor, they are people too. If they at least know your face, it will help you later on.  Be social! Never again in your life will you be around so many people your age with similar interests. You will make friends for life!  Never wear anything IU. No explanation needed.  Go to sporting events! The teams work hard and every bit of support helps.  Thou shalt not wear thy varsity jacket. Those achievements are from high school. Achieve more and don't just relive the glory days!  Upperclassmen are here to help! We were all freshman at one point and it is okay to ask questions. Everyone will be more than willing to show you where classes are etc.  Be proud to be a Boilermaker! We've been to the moon, have a Super Bowl winning QB alumni, and we aren't IU. What more could you want?  If you follow these ten steps you too will be a succesful Boilermaker. Have a fun year. Boiler Up, Hammer Down!...and fuck IU.  <eos> \n",

And it's only more difficult because I don't have a debit card currently or a car. So, any idea?  If any kind soul on here would is able to help me out - I'd obviously pay you back!  UPDATE: Thanks y’all. I learned you can actually withdraw money from an ATM with a credit card. Withdrew some some cash then went to Rack and Roll to get some quarters (and played a bit of Pac-Man because I felt guilty- there’s a sticker that said the exchange should only be used for the arcade lol) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Answer's probably no but I wanted to cover all my bases. My grandma's coming over during October break and she'll want a sort of tour around the campus so she knows I'm doing what where. For now, my and my parents' plan is to drive around the roads and show her what we can from that area. We can't exactly walk around campus because it's so wide and she isn't the best at walking at the moment. My dad went on the website and decided that that answer is \"no\" but I feel that he didn't actually call anyone. Just wanted to ask here. Is it possible to rent a golf cart/have a golf cart tour? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! I made a throwaway account for this. I'm looking for a professor or someone who works full time at Purdue to sponsor the Purdue Cosplay Club. Previously we were partnered with another club, but we wanted to branch off to become our own club so right now we are unofficial. We already have weekly meetings, officers, a Facebook page, etc. All we need pretty much is someone to sign their name, you can be as active or inactive as you'd like. There is an event we would like to attend soon; however, since we're not an official club we can't.  If you are someone who qualifies to be a sponsor and would like to, or you have a suggestion of someone for us to ask, please PM me! Thank you! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm planning on starting off in Computer Engineering wherever I go and then switching once I make up my mind after the first semester/year. I'll probably end up going to grad school, so that's something to keep in mind.  If everything was equal, I think I'd go to Rose, but it's a bit too far and a bit too expensive for me.  I think at this point I'm leaning towards Valpo because I live rather close and already know some people there and have stuff I can do over there, I like the campus, and I like the smaller classes. However, I'm a bit worried about getting there and being overwhelmed with overly religious people. It isn't really a big deal there if you don't actively seek it out, but I'm not too sure about it.  Purdue's (strangely) virtually the same net cost as Valpo for me, so that's not a factor between the two. I suppose Purdue would have more resources and diversity, but my visit didn't really do much for me. My dad got his Master's degree here and my mom a Bachelor's, so they've told me about it over the years. So, why did you guys choose Purdue?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My supervisor has asked me about working on a project for the company I am interning for.  A little background to get some understanding. I am interning in the quality engineering department. I really have very little coding experience, so hoping someone here might have some ideas. I was recently accepted into aero, but my internship is just a general engineering internship.  The company manager has asked me to create a way to prioritize all parts coming into the inspection room. He wants a way to have the inspectors work only on the parts needed as a priority, then move to priority b, then c, and so forth. This priority scale changes weekly and sometimes even daily depending on what final product needs to be shipped to inventory after inspecting. For example, a work order has come in for a raptor. The manufacturing department will go to supply for all parts needed to create a raptor. Supply comes to quality to restock after a full inspection is attained. The question is how to best create a way to continually prioritize the parts coming in to quality inspection as needed by supply and manufacturing? Right now the inspectors get an excel sheet and they have to go thru this sheet for each part as they come in to see where it belongs. The parts come into inspection randomly, with very little rhyme or reason. One day they get 100 different parts that will go to any number of final projects orders. So, they are asking me to come up with a way for the inspectors to know which of the 100 plus parts are more important and needed quicker instead of just doing them one by one.  Any ideas or current programs out there that may give an insight to a way I can help the company achieve their goal. Their final goal would be as the part comes in, the inspector barcodes or types the part into a computer, which gives the priority level. Then the inspectors can work only on certain priority items first before moving to secondary items.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey fellow boilermakers, just found out about this subreddit, so here is a story and some question. Back when I was in Purdue (ECE class of 05, I am old, I know), when I was taking intro-level physics for Engineering major (I think it is Phys 152, it's been a while). There was ALWAYS a streaker during exams.   One time during the 2nd midterm the guy even have 'F=ma' written on his buttcheeks, it was fucking awesome. The best part was, during the final, since the huge amount of examinees, they have to host the exam in Mackey Arena. And the TAs/Professors are well prepared this time. They actually have all the TAs came and guard the entrance/exit, and we all knew what was coming (the streaker came to every single exam without fail). And sure enough, he showed up with nothing, but this time he had a cape. It was freaking sweet. The TAs didn't hesitate for a single second, all of them launched into action, I stopped writing/calculating for a second as I know this will culminate to nothing but sheer epicness. And the streaker knew what is going on, as he started to make his round around the venue (it was a basketball arena FYI, it was by no mean a small place), and now almost ALL TAs (including the ones guarding the exit) were on his tail, and that's exactly what he wanted. As soon as he saw that, he sped up and RAN right out of the stadium and never to be seen again, the crowd cheered and laughed until the TAs reminded us we are still taking the exam.   Everyone wonders who this mysterious streaker was, as he had provided us so much joy during the soul-crushing hours of exams. But as far as I know, no one knew who he was.  It was a great story, which I still tell some of my friend (he wrote F on his left cheek, = sign in the middle, and ma on the right cheek) as a great party story. Also, the guy must have ran for the track team or something since he managed to out-ran EVERYONE in the stadium, every time. So who is this hero? An alum/senior? Anyone here knew or have any hint? If any of you guys still in engineering major, have this happened to your class? Any other zany stories during your time in Purdue?  <eos> \n",

I have a couple off-campus apartments ready for me to sign a lease but I would rather live in a dorm if possible. Do anyone sophomores or upperclassmen have any idea what the likelihood of me getting a dorm this year is? How many kids usually give up their dorms after signing up for one? I've been thinking of just signing a lease because that is an 100% chance of me getting housing next year rather than gambling on the dorms. But if say 100 kids usually give up their dorms I won't sign. What do you guys think? <eos> \n",

Coming to WL for the day this Saturday with a few other Spartans. We've figured out that we're going to be in the public pay lots to the SW of Ross-Ade. We're going to get there as soon as lots open at 7:30, but we're having an issue with food. We don't really want to bring a grill or crock pots or anything, so we're thinking about doing a 'lazy' tailgate and bringing precooked food.  My question is this: Are there any pizza places around WL that are open in the wee hours (i.e. before 8) that we can bring some pizza from? Can we pay a delivery guy to show up with pizza? Do you guys have any other ideas that can help us out? Thanks in advance - I'm really looking forward to this weekend, and I promise we'll soften up IU for you guys when we play them next weekend.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> First off, sorry for the title.  Secondly, does anyone know how the parking passes work exactly? If they scan it does it just tell them its valid or does it show specific information about the car (make, model, plate etc.)? I'm asking because I want to trade off my pass with a friend next spring. I know it says you can't do that but what is college without frugality fueled risks? Also, does anyone know the penalty for getting caught doing this? It will be an A pass, I don't know if that makes a difference <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello Everyone, I just wanted to let Purdue Engineering students know about the Engineering Bracket Challenge currently running on Electronic/Machine Design technical publication websites. The challenge is currently in round 4 and Purdue Engineering is one of the 4 remaining universities left. The other 3 universities are Cornell, Caltech, and Georgia Tech. The way the Bracket Challenge works is, the university that receives the most votes in each round moves on to the next. Since we are down to only 4 universities, the winners of this round will move into the championship next week. Sponsors are handing out prizes for voting, as well as a grand prize to the winning university. The winning university will gain access to an online design challenge. Students from this university only can submit ideas into this challenge and take a shot at winning:  * 1st) Apple Macbook Pro * 2nd) Apple iPad Air * 3rd ) GoPro Camera Please take a moment to stop in and vote for your school and take a shot at some great prizes. For more information and to vote, visit: [url link] If you have any questions please let me know! Thanks and good luck Purdue Engineering! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I realized that we don't have a FAQs for incoming students or students thinking about Purdue. I was thinking that we could talk about our experiences to help answer students questions/concerns about Purdue. Then we could link to this in the sidebar or create a FAQs page so that we wouldn't be spammed by these types of questions. It would be nice to get a broad range of opinions, fresh-victory lap(aka super seniors) w/ as many majors as possible. If this gets big enough we could also look into splitting this into grad and undergrad Here are few possible topics we could address Best dorms, Best hangouts on campus, things to check-out during campus visits, overrated stuff, where to get text books, supplies you will need to buy/bring, is a car important... **Edit ** what are some great resources that Purdue has that took you forever to find about about? **Edit** What are west laf. and lafayette like?

I would really appreciate it if you can spare 20-30 minutes of your time to complete a couple of design tasks using this system. I will pick 3 top responses to the survey in terms of quality of the submission. These 3 students will be given an opportunity to 3D print their design and keep it as a souvenir after the study is complete. Since I am not collecting identifying information (names/emails), we will use a unique filename generated from the survey for identifying the winners. Therefore, please remember to save a copy of all the downloaded files from this survey to your computer. I will post the winning ID's by January 15 on my lab website: [url link]  If you are interested in participating, please complete the survey through the link provided below.

I took four years of German in high school, and never felt overly strong in the class, but I did get a 4 on the AP exam which is why she suggested that I take 202 this year. I was just wondering how the class is seeing how I havent taken a college language course before. Thanks!

            "<bos> Yo boilermakers. My work commute takes me through Purdue campus every day. I write this because I want every student to make it to class safely in the morning and I also write it because I don’t want to run you over, thus increasing my insurance premium... During rush hour in the evening and especially the morning, please pay attention to the street signs. When turning I’ve almost hit students numerous times when they’ve not heeded the don’t walk sign.  This is compounded by the fact that in some cases while turning I have to prevent myself from being tboned because I have a caution turn light. But when I have that light, the students get the do not walk light... yet they walk out anyway. Again, I want everyone to be safe so please just pay attention to those signs, especially when it’s dark during the morning and as it slowly gets darker in the evening. That intersection is hella busy during rush hour and people are trying to get home to their families safely as well. So please be polite to those of us who have cars. This goes double for the cyclists... you all seem to have a deathwish on campus and I don’t want anything to happen to you. Just be vigilant and don’t be ignorant. Pay attention to your surroundings and heed the signs, especially during rush hour.  <eos> \n",

The Purdue website says that if you've been away for only a semester, you don't need to complete an application.

            "<bos> I was at a zebra crossing today, the walking sign's blinking and I was getting ready to cross, when all of a sudden my life flashed before my eyes. Cars, multiple cars, a long stream of cars not less than 8, made right turns when it was my right to cross. As a dumbass college student, I thought I was crossing before it was my right to do so, but that walking sign was right opposite me, blinking and counting down. And so the cars continued to come until I completely missed my chance to cross, and had to wait for the next walking period (idek what to call it).  So my question is, do cars get the right of way to turn even though the pedestrian crossing sign thingy is on? This was at the Grant/Northwestern intersection outside of Knoy Hall, so I'm not sure if there was a traffic light for right turning. I was hella tempted to just walk out in front of the cars to stop them from going, but I decided my life was more important.  <eos> \n",

You have 20 students in a class and you just talk about current issues and be in a controlled debate environment. It can be anything. It'll teach you something that we all need as a people, and that is the attribute of \"listening\". Listen to people's opinions, and maybe you can understand where they are coming from, or maybe you don't. But I notice so many people who just don't listen, and therefore create this false representation of a person or even a group.  I don't know, just my thoughts. Love to hear yours. <eos> \n",

I live just north of Ross-Ade, so having a bike is very helpful. Anyway, Northwestern hill has been rough on my bike, and it has been getting steadily less reliable and more difficult to ride.

Dtella lives on, and will be supported for the foreseeable future.  **News:** There is a new [dtella client]([url link] that all users will need to download! Dtella will not work without it! **Dtella will now work on PAL!** After hundreds of requests, we have made Dtella PAL-compatible again. At this point we are confident in PAL's setup. There is a chance that something could go wrong, please contact us [here]([url link]  Again, you **must** [download the new client]([url link] for Dtella to work! This installer can also install ApexDC++ which is the official DC client for Dtella and highly recommended for all users. If you are already using Apex, you don't need to check that box. For all returning users: this new client will not know your old port settings. You will need to reset those. **New Users:** What is Dtella you ask? Dtella is a file sharing network that is limited to Purdue students. The network is very secure and has anything you can dream about (if its not there, we can get it). Before getting to campus, you can [read the FAQ]([url link] install the [Dtella client]([url link] (it won't work until you are on campus), or [chat with us]([url link] **Issues and new website:** By now returning users have noticed that we are using a new website: [dtella.net]([url link] This website is the **only** website that is up to date and maintained by the current Dtella staff! The dtella.org website and IRC servers are still running but will not get you the new installer, the current dtella chat, or correct information. Our new website is still under content development, so there may be a few things missing that will be added shortly.

I'm a junior by year but because I switched into my major so late (end of last semester) I'm incredibly ahead on my gen eds (in fact, almost done I believe) but really behind in my major--essentially I'm a junior taking freshman level classes. I will have to take an extra year to graduate and I'm starting to feel self conscious about that and being so behind in general. I know that I really ought to get an internship this summer, but going to career fairs is really hard because I'm the right year but I don't have any of the experience to back it up. It's just getting really hard because now so many of my peers are getting interviews and offers and I'm so behind the curve comparatively. I don't know how to get myself feeling better about where I'm at right now. Any tips or advice, boilermaker to boilermaker? <eos> \n",

I would really like to convert my internship into a full-time offer and appreciate any advice that I can get. Additionally, I'm an international student so I'd also appreciate any advice on the workplace culture in America. As I'm also a minority, I also appreciate any advice on fitting in. Really, any helpful advice will do. Also feel free to share your experience and advice with other Boilermakers who will be completing internships this summer. <eos> \n",

I did some google-fu and found some really bad reviews of their network from the mid-2000s, and I'm wondering if it's improved since then. <eos> \n",

I came into Purdue wanting to do BME, and I'd say that's what interests me more, but it is too specialized for me, etc etc... I scheduled for ME because it's a safe bet but am very worried about doing poorly because I won't be interested in my classes. I was in the Honors FYE program and already had a rough year. I'm feeling I want to do something more on the science-y side. I've done *ok* at Purdue math and find chemistry interesting. If anyone could give me the truth about who should and should not do ChemE I'd appreciate it. I've heard varying opinions.  <eos> \n",

The business was an interview with Purdue, and I was recently offered the position (just waiting on the Background check). I'd like to thank all those who suggested Black Sparrow (definitely my kind of place) and not sure if James and Jacob are redditors, but I wanted to also thank those guys for showing me around a bit. The other establishments I didn't get a chance to discover, looks like I'll have plenty of time now. Oh, also went to the Triple X....got stuck in a conversation with a stranger who was talking about beating the crap out of somebody. It was a very Socially Awkward Penguin moment. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all! I'll be at Purdue University over the summer (doing a high school summer thing...no, it's not one of those expensive for-credit things, lol). I was just wondering where I can get a good idea of what Purdue's like, especially over the summer. I'm very interested in the food there, since I heard Purdue has one of the best dining halls out of any college. How easy is it to eat \"healthily\" there? I'm one of those \"calorie-counters,\" so I can get very picky with my food :P... Hey, abs are made in the kitchen - not in the gym, lol... Unfortunately, I won't be fortunate enough to be cooking all my foods, so I'm hoping there are at least really good salad bars / sources of protein I can get from eating there :D! Haha... Anyway, thanks all! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So this is the 2nd summer in a row that I applied to the DURI programs and did not receive a research position. I'm guessing it's because my gpa isn't amazing at 3.64. I also emailed more than 10 professors about research opportunities, including past professors that I got A's with, and I got only 1 reply back (a polite 'no'). Now people have told me it's best to go in and talk to them face-to-face but I'm not moving to campus for another month. I really want a research position because I want to apply to graduate schools next summer. I am majoring in pharmaceutical sciences. So do you have any advice? <eos> \n",

I'm typically an A student but this semester has been particularly hard as i've been working a job and have been quite busy. My grades right now are basically straight B's and 1 C.

Or we just normalize by the highest grade as it is said in the syllabus. What was the mean grade in the midterm last semester?  How is the final in comparison?

We used it in front of the couch/tv and then could put some stuff under the legs to play games with alcoholic beverages [url link] It's 6 feet long and about ~~18 inches~~ 24 inches tall. The P in the middle is actually gold (hard to see in the photo) with a white border just like the actual logo. It's got a clear lacquer coat so you can spill stuff on it and it wipes right off. It's got a few dings around the edges but some black paint would cover it up fine. I just need to get it moved, as long as you got a truck or van to move it I will give it to the highest bidder - even if that bid is $0 EDIT: Measurements <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So, I failed AAE 203 last year, because I didn't try. So I need a different Engineering Breadth class. I've tentatively put NUCL 200 on my class list, because it actually seems interesting. But I know all too well classes that may seem interesting really are not, and vice versa. IE 335 (I think that's the right number) doesn't seem very interesting, but seems fairly easy. It requires me to get an override, though, which is obnoxious. Does anyone have any of their own suggestions? The general consensus appears to be that CE's statics and nucl 200 are both relatively easy. Considering nucl 200 fits in my schedule better, I'll probably stick with that. I'm still open for comments, though. <eos> \n",

I have a question- I'm currently enrolled into a section of calculus but there's a another section with a timing that I like better, the only problem is that section is full. I wanted to place myself on the Waitlist for the section I want, but it won't let me place myself on it because it says I'm already enrolled into a different section.

            "<bos> Hello everyone! I lost my keys in Smith Hall earlier this morning, sometime between 11 am and 12:30 pm. I believe I left them in the women's restroom on the first floor, or dropped them somewhere along the way on my trek from there to Smith 118 just around the corner. I checked both rooms extensively and have found nothing. All of my keys for my apartment and vehicle are attached, so I really would like to find them if they aren't gone for good! There is a Honda car key (NOT keyless entry, so the lock/unlock/panic buttons are on the head of the key), and there are also several other keys attached- one black plastic \"key\" with bumps on the top (RFID key? not sure), one smaller silver key with a rounded head, gold key, and silver key with some chipped pink nail polish on the top of it. If anyone has found them please message me on here so I can arrange to grab them from you, or let me know where I can pick them up! There is a reward for their return, as understandably I really would like to not have to pay to get every single one of my keys remade. Thank you all in advance for your help!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm doing terrible in ENGL 106. To be precise, I have no idea what I am doing wrong and it is mostly from not knowing what is expected of me in the assignments (ex, I got counted down because my font was the wrong color. It was in the color of the template I was given, so I assumed that is what was expected).  It's probably my fault, but as the weeks have gone on my grade has dropped more and more. We're starting to do essay writing (something I considered a strength of mine and got an A in a college class for previously) and my grade is just sinking even more.  Anyway, I typically did very well in essay writing and in previous college classes, but I am bombing this class left and right and it is not getting better.  Do I have any alternatives besides taking the low grade and just trying my best? Is this something an adviser could help me with?  <eos> \n",

I have a very great recommendation from my AP Computer Science teacher and have not begun to work on my essay yet but I suspect it won't be bad. I will be taking AP Physics C and college level Calculus (credited to Ball State) + AP Stats as a senior. I got stuck with taking both college level German 201 and Japanese 201 and Japanese took a lot of time and effort that I could have focused on other courses. Anyways, chances?

            "<bos> There are many ways to describe Purdue's FYE program. The following are my own thoughts after being in the program during the '13-'14 year. FYE is pretty much a tool used by the university to demoralize new engineering students to the point where anybody who isn't serious enough about becoming an engineer will drop or fail out of the program. I'm not trying to tell you to give up or be discouraged, but be aware that your FYE courses shouldn't be taken lightly. Purdue is a great university, especially when it comes to engineering, so be prepared to be challenged as some of the world's brightest students. A few rules you should follow: be sure to create a balance between your education, health, and social life, as hanging out with friends and getting exercise are important supplements to, but should not replace, valuable study time. Attend (and be sober for) every lecture, lab, and recitation. Go to office hours, start assignments early, be serious about your team projects, and above all, get 'enough' sleep. I failed to follow most of these rules during my first semester, making my freshman year both stressful for me and unimpressive for internship resumes. Again, I'm really not trying to discourage you. Even when college gets tough, keep in mind that you were accepted into Purdue's engineering program because they know you are capable of succeeding here. If you find yourself struggling, there are many on-campus resources for you to take advantage of, whether you're struggling with a single class, time management, or some deeper personal issue. Just remember, your college experience depends completely on what priorities and decisions you make. Good luck! <eos> \n",

A lot of people tend to complain because it's just like typical New Year's gym crowd, etc. But don't let that discourage you! Go to the gym, be healthy, and stick with it. Especially new freshman; you all get access to all-you-can eat, every day. It's easy to put on more than a few pounds if you aren't careful, especially with all the alcohol you will be consuming. Just don't be stupid -- ask someone for help if you don't know what you're doing. No one cares that you can't lift that heavy, can only run two laps at a time, whatever. We all started somewhere. The blue shirts at the co rec are called \"fitness consultants\", or at least I think that's their title anyway. They're paid to show you what to do, give you pointers, give you a spot. They'll even take a video of you lifting and email it to you from their ipads so you can assess your form. But for the love of god, NO CURLS IN THE SQUAT RACK. And don't forget to rack your weights. <eos> \n",

I have no side projects at all but got all As so my GPA is 3.92. I was wondering if I could get an internship this summer if I maintain this kind of GPA. If I maintain a high GPA like this with no side projects, would it be possible to get a great job in Silicon Valley after graduation? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, I didn't get into com217 or great issues for next semester and I would like to get into one. I am scheduled for CS373 which is full, but I am willing to drop it if you agree to drop either COM217 or a great issues class. Please PM if you're interested. I really want to take one of those classes next semester. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am currently a second semester freshman in CS. I know that I have to take 30 (I think) credits of anything, which people usually use to pursue a minor. While I am really interested in CS, I would like to do something more hands-on for a minor. I was looking through the [minor offerings]([url link] and have seen a few that I am interested it.  * Furniture Design (I basically see this as woodworking) * Electrical Engineering Technology (I assume I would get to build electronics) * Computer and information technology (Building servers and networks?) I was looking for some feedback if anyone else has done these and if my assumptions are correct.  Thank you! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was passing Wetherill about 20min ago (9pm monday) and there were firetrucks, ambulances, and police cars all around the building. I think I got there just after things had been resolved since the area wasn't roped off and there were guys putting on or taking off the orange/yellow hazmat suits. There were a few people standing around but they didn't seem to know anything. I will update this once a News station picks up the story. In the mean time does anyone else know anything? **UPDATE** thanks to [makingboilers07]([url link] for the [hookup]([url link] Turns out it was a small explosion.

            "<bos> I'm starting freshman year at Purdue this fall and I'm a bit confused as to how the roommate assignment works. On the housing contract application, I can see where I list preferences and I can view other students who match my preferences. If I don't specifically request one of them, will Purdue automatically assign me to someone with a similar profile or will it completely disregard my preferences? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I have some amazing news... earlier today, I got my second college acceptance... into Purdue University! I applied Regular Decision as a Web Programming and Design major. The reason I didn't apply as a standard Computer Science major is because Purdue's Computer Science program is extremely competitive. One person from this subreddit actually previously PM'ed me saying that he got accepted into UC Berkeley for Computer Science but denied from Purdue. He did get into his alternate major at the Polytechnic school in Purdue though, and he is currently a Boilermaker. The fact that he got accepted by Berkeley but denied by Purdue for Computer Science gave me a wake-up call and made me realize that applying to Purdue as a Computer Science major would be crap-shoot. I have a 3.29 UW GPA from 9-11th grade and there's an F on my transcript too which I sadly can't make up (with 1st semester senior year grades, my W GPA goes up and UW GPA goes slightly down.) I have a 30 superscore ACT. While these are certainly \"not bad\", they aren't up to Purdue's caliber when it comes to undergrad Computer Science. (*I can share a detailed post of my high school statistics if you are interested.*) I am still extremely passionate and interested in Web Design (I even interned at a web design company as a software engineer this past summer in the silicon valley) and have showed that through my essays and extracurriculars.  I'm still waiting on more college decisions, but I am glad I got into Purdue, which is a really good school. **Anyways, here are my questions. Feel free to answer whichever ones you want/can:** 1. What are the differences between the Web Programming  Design Major, and the standard Computer Science major? 2. What are the job prospects like for the Web Programming  Design major vs. the standard Computer Science major? 3. How hard is it to transfer to a standard Computer Science major from a Web Programming  Design major? I'm sure I'll love the Web Programming  Design major, but if I feel like I'm missing out on something, or the major lacks something, what would be the prerequisites to transfer? As a computer science major, I'd try to have a focus on software engineering/design. 4. Feel free to comment on anything else regarding the school or the Web Programming  Design major as a whole. 5. How many Black people attend Purdue? My racist grandpa doesn't want me to attend a college with too many Blacks/African-Americans. He wants me to be surrounded by and to hang out with more white people.  Thanks, and Boiler Up! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've noticed that many self posts have been receiving quite a few downvotes lately. Some I can understand if they seem to not fit with Purdue, but others are people asking for assistance for problems that are very real to the normal student at Purdue. One of the duties I see of this subreddit is to help out fellow students. It's hard to help those in need when posts get downvoted and are rarely seen. I feel it is important to follow reddiquette and keep an open mind to posts. Don't give a link a negative vote just because the link doesn't reflect your opinion or you think they have a stupid question. Try giving a link an upvote if it offers something that is thought provoking. Discussion is important and should be promoted. tl:dr Be open minded and think before downvoting <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I am an incoming grad student this fall and my program requires me to arrive before 3rd August for TA training. However since my apartment's lease date starts at 17th August, I will need to find a place to stay during that window. I know this is an awkward timeframe but I would prefer not to book a room in Union Hotel for 2 weeks due to the cost. Any suggestion? Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys! So, I'm taking Phys 172 this semester, and we're halfway through the course, with 2 exams done. So, basically my non-exam weighted total just came out. I scored 76%, whereas the average was 91%! Also, my average for first 2 exams was 42%, which puts my current final grade at 59%. Am I done for in this course? Please let me know... Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am registered for COM 11400 for summer 2016 maymester. The classes were supposed to start yesterday. The problem is that since I have never taken an online course before I don't where to view the lectures from or where to submit homeworks; I just don't know how to get started. I looked up on blackboard because I thought there would be some instructions on blackboard before the course starts. However, the course was supposed to start yesterday and I still don't have any information about the course. If you have taken this online course or if you know how online courses work please help me out. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm here for the summer at Purdue, taking CS250 starting on the 11th. I've been working pretty much full time, but I'm pretty much the only person working at the place I'm at right now. The peace and quiet was nice for a little while, but now I'm slowly dying in that tiny little office. Also, I live in a house with one other person who isn't home very often and is much older than me so it's been really hard to find common interests. None of my friends are on campus for the summer \\- long story short, I'm bored out of my mind and I'm looking for some people to meet. To give you some background, I just finished my freshman year in CS, 19, male, and I like going to the gym, playing games \\(both video games and board/card games\\), and music. I'm pretty much open to anything, though, I've tried a lot of new things this past year! Do you have any advice? Also if you're in a similar situation or if you just feel like meeting up, lets do it! PM me! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everybody- This past year I had four new roommates (who I didn't know) move into my apartment. We are all on individual leases with our landlord. Since they've moved in, they've been an absolute nightmare. They've caused flooding multiple times by not using shower curtains and getting water all over the floor, as well as smoked in the house despite repeated warnings from both me and the management. I tried being nice and civil, and I even told them it was OK to smoke pot and hookah in the house because I'm not an asshole, I just can't deal with cigarette smoke. In our leases it clearly states that smoking is only allowed if every member of the house agrees to it. They are in clear violation of the lease we signed, yet the property managers seem pretty indifferent about it. Is there any sort of legal recourse I can fall back on to get my management to start evicting them? The impression I got is that they really don't give a shit because they're going to make a boatload of money off of the 4 of them (and the associated damages) regardless.  <eos> \n",

I would really appreciate if someone can make a rather blunt comment on Purdue's design program (information that they don't tell you), and why would you recommend Purdue over other colleges?

            "<bos> Hey everyone, I'm an incoming freshman who is currently in exploratory studies and I am thinking of going the CS route and end up CODO'ing into it. However, I scored a 71% on ALEKS which is 4% below the requirement to get into calculus. That means I would have to take MA158 and it does not count towards CODO GPA calculation and is a zero credit course for CS which IMO is a complete waste of time. I took the computer science course at my high school which was miserable and I did not learn anything. It was taught by the business teacher who was not even sure how to operate a computer so essentially, that was a waste of time, but an easy A. That being said, I feel like I would have to take CS177 because although I know a few things about programming, I consider myself a complete beginner, but this course also is a zero credit course for CS which IMO is also a waste of time and money. So what should I do? I can take the ALEKS assessment four more times and I know that I can get that 75% to get in calculus, but if I do that I feel like I would be setting myself up for failure and not be able to handle the course. My STAR meeting is next week (7/12) and before I go there, I would like some of you to enlighten me. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos>  I have contacted the PUID office and they replied that I would only be able to get a replacement by going to the office in person, which is impossible for me since I'm an international student currently out of the states and I won't be arriving on campus until midnight of Friday, 21st, Aug. And I assume they won't be of service on weekends, will they?  My dorm's (Hawkins) officers strictly told me that my PUID was required for me to check in, which means I won't be able to get in my room until Monday, 24th. The rooms of Union Club Hotel and Campus Inn are basically booked out and it kills me to pay an extra 300 bucks before the semester starts. I know I'm the only one to blame for this but is there any way for me to compensate? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I've been looking at some of the Discovery Park Undergrad Research projects as I am interested in doing research over the summer, since I will be here for summer school (taking ECE 202 and ME 323).  For those who have had experience with it, please let me know how it went. Would taking those summer classes while doing research be too much?  Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> They suck. Big time.  I have my active directory on min.ecn and the connection times out every now and then. I also use firefox and thunderbird which sync all their data in an sqlite db hosted on the personal directory (on min). Also I keep working data on the same directory and not on my lab machine (for automatic backup purposes). It frustrates me to no hell when that dreaded timeout happens. Anyone else shares my pain? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, everyone! I am having a mid-life crisis instead of studying for my finals. Please give me some advices and some positive thoughts also. Currently, I am a junior in College of Health and Human Sciences. My advisor DIDN'T tell me that I could graduate a semester early...I really don't like her. I signed a year long lease for my apartment. I REALIZED that I REALLY SCREWED...I could have done get a single room in hawkins do don't have to deal with sublease and whatnot. Since I signed the lease after fall break, so there is no way I could back up from my lease. And right now, I am seeing a lot of people posting sublease on facebook. It makes really worrying what if I ended up not finding a sublet. Also, I do not want to graduate early cuz I really don't know what I want to do in the future. And I don't want to sound like I am graduating on time not early because I couldn't find a sublet. And during the last semester, I have absolutely have nothing to take because I would be taking Spring 2017 during Fall 2016. I am wondering what would you guys do if you were in my situation. I can't even sleep well these days and feel so stuffy and frustrated. Thank you all!!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, I graduated recently from Purdue, and I've been getting emails from the Alumni Association to sign up. The \"benefits\" they talk about when it comes to insurance is marginal at best, and I don't care about their magazine at all. However, I'm more interested in the networking aspect of membership. I'm curious to see if former members of the alumni association thought it was worthwhile paying the $500 for a lifetime membership. Like, they talk about the \"Brazen\" social network on their website. Doesn't really tell me anything about how active it is. So, was it worth it? P.S. I ask for former members because I don't want a sales pitch from someone who has a vested interest in seeing the organization grow. <eos> \n",

All opinions appreciated :) Also: I've had experience with high school physics 1 and 2, and did well both both of them if that makes a difference <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Last Thursday I wasn’t towed from my normal Residence Hall parking spot on 3rd St. in front of Hilly, but I woke up to three band buses taking up the spot my car used to sit in. Ended up walking 15 minutes in the rain to the Discovery Park parking lot to my car, with an at least $35 ticket (plus towing fees). I thought I was good because my car wasn’t in any of the roads warned about last game, but I guess not. I’ll be parking in McCutcheon from now on I suppose. Also, my ticket is near-disintegrating because of the rain, so better to check sooner rather than later. Boiler up? <eos> \n",

I'm currently in HTM 372: *World Tourism Geography*, and one of our projects is conducting an in-depth interview with an international student or faculty member to learn about their home country. While this sounds simple enough, there is one major restriction in that they cannot be Chinese, Korean, or Indian. No one I currently know passes this restriction, so I can't interview any of the friends I've met so far on campus. Because of this, I'll need to get in touch with people I've never met before, and I don't know the best way of going about that. So if you have any advice on how to do so, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! <eos> \n",

I believe I have the grades to get into Purdue (3.8 unweighted gpa, 29 ACT, 1920 SAT), but I'm not sure if I want to pay higher tuition+room and board at Purdue when I can just live at home and go to Purdue Calumet. So I'm asking to see if a degree from Purdue Cal. is not as \"good\" as a Purdue-Main campus degree from the employers' POV. Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've recently got a chance to go to Purdue for Ms+Phd while working as a research assistent. Being from europe, I have couple questions regarding the school and general life in lafayette. 1. What's the best acommodation for a international graduate student like me who doesn't just study but wants to be close to nightlife? (and that is cheap) 2. I understand that I can't grab a beer in public, but from what I've read, it can be a problem to go drunk home from a pub, alone. Is it such a problem even though I'm older than 21? As I said, i'm from europe, so this concept is pretty hard for me to grasp. Also, if I live in the dorms, what's the exact policy on alcohol? 3. What are the average living expenses? 4. If I arrive for the spring semester, will I miss some \"intro\" events? Is there any organization that helps international students to get settled? Are there of these welcome events for graduate students that didn't study at purdue before? 5. If there are any RAs here, how much free time do you have when you attend the school while working on research projects for the faculty?  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I am currently achieving that, however i am worried i might not be able to achieve it in the final examination. Does anyone who took IB know how strict Purdue is in terms of final grades? would they rescind my acceptance offer if i achieve a score lower than 35? <eos> \n",

So Im thinking of scheduling an appointment with CAPS but I dont know if my case is serious enough to qualify going. I dont have panic attacks or any disabilities or anything. Ive never been on any medication either. They dont have walk ins and youre supposed to schedule an appointment. I have no idea what to expect.  I guess I'm wondering whether anyone just feeling sad have tried going to CAPS? And if so, how was the experience? Did it help? Edit - Thanks everyone for all the encouragement.

            "<bos> Hey guys. I'm an international student (Indian) and I applied to Purdue with the prospective major of Computer Science. Initially, I got the \"Denied/Offered Alternative Major\" decision and I decided to reapply with alternative majors. This time I ended up getting in, but with the Computer and Information Technology major. My question is, is it going to be at all viable to think about going there and switching majors? In my original email (the Denied/Offered Alternative Major one) this was written: You will have the opportunity to identify up to three alternative majors and should select them in priority order. Only choose majors in which you are truly interested. If you are admitted, we cannot guarantee you would be able to switch from the alternative major into the major you originally requested on your application. Typically, majors that are in very high demand at the admission stage also have limited capacity for enrolled students seeking to switch. So I get the feeling that it'd be very very difficult to switch majors, but I really don't know if it's a gamble worth taking so I'm hoping I could get some insight here. It's worth nothing at this point that if I'm understanding this correctly, IT is at the Polytechnic Institute but CS is at the \"main\" Purdue campus? I don't really 100% know what the distinction is but I think it's worth mentioning. At the end of the day I really don't want to study IT...probably bad form to mention this in this subreddit, but I also got an acceptance for CS in SUNY Buffalo. I know that the hard fact is that Purdue's more reputed than Buffalo, but honestly I want to learn about the CS side of things, I looked up the courses and it's like, I won't even do a bit of programming until sophomore year? And even then it'll just be introduction to C. So it's a tough decision for me to make.  Thanks a ton if you could help me out with switching majors and some insight! Also, if anyone's taken/in in the IT major, input would be really appreciated. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> $15-$20 per hour, probably 20 depending on effectiveness I suspect 1-3 hours per week for 2-3 weeks MAX.  I let this class get a little behind. Most of my classmates took CAD last year in high school, but I graduated in '02 so its been awhile.  I'm behind 3 weeks of labs, which consists of 8 renderings total. The only effort I have put into this class is during class. I just need someone to walk me through the process of it. If you're a REALLY good teacher id pay $25, but not right away.  I'm a decently fast learner, just putting most of my effort into the other classes i'm taking, so it wont be an extra painful experience to show me how to use Inventor. Looking to meet up any weekday after 430, earlier other days, maybe a weekend afternoon. Im pretty flexible aside from my class schedule. Just send me a text or call me @ 765-586-1871. My name is Mike T. We can meet in a public place for safety if you want. I have my own computer that runs Inventor decently and I ride a moped. If you can explain it to me like a guru and we get all 8 renderings done in like 2 hours I will give you a huge tip.  Tl;dr: Will pay $ for CGT Autocard Inventor tutor  call/text Mike @ 765-586-1871 and i'll check my reddit inbox daily. Thanks! Edit: words   <eos> \n",

My running mate Kyle Pendergast and I are running on the idea of Team Purdue – a group of students who want to work together to accomplish common goals and make changes that will positively impact Purdue today and in the future. You can find our platform at www.teampurdue.org. Please ask me any questions you have about our platform, about Purdue Student Government, or about life. About myself: I’m in the reddit 1 year club. I currently serve as a Senator in the Student Senate and chair the Student Affairs committee. I’m a junior in nursing, a 4th generation Boilermaker, and a member of the Purdue “All-American” Marching Band. I love this place and I want to make it better with help from you! If elected, I see doing AMAs on /r/purdue as a great way to continue garnering student input and discussing issues that affect students. Ultimately I would LOVE to see President Daniels do an AMA and would definitely suggest it to him at the first opportunity I get. tl;dr: I’m running for student body VP.

I have a bit of a question about fraternity parties and outside parties on campus. It seem to me so far that the greek life is very disconnected from the rest of campus, and most every party they host is closed off to people not either in their fraternity or from an invited sorority. That leads to my question, does this open up as the year goes on and the pledges are all set in, or are will I just have to pledge a fraternity if I want to find anything to do on campus. So far the only other parties I've found around here are smaller house/apartment parties that are pretty cool, but never absolutely insane like some of the rush parties I went to. I guess the point of this whole post is, \"Is this really it?\". I mean you hear so much about the crazy college life, and I find myself with way more downtime than I would like on weekends. <eos> \n",

I had some personal problems during 2015 and my GPA hit rock bottom, and I came this close to getting dropped from the school, but I've been climbing my way out steadily since. I will extend that trend into the future, because I'm done with getting bad grades.  Extracurriculars are good, as far as experience and leadership goes. I feel like I've been doing my due diligence by applying to several companies ahead of time (have a few more to write cover letters for), finding references for many of those companies, and looking at stock info to get a better idea of what they do and how they make their money. What should people in this position do to maximize their chances for any kind of internship? **Update:** went to Boilermaker Circuit today and was told by both of the companies I talked to said that outside of GPA, I'm a perfect candidate (Boeing basically told me to fuck off and come back next year). So I'll look at smaller companies and startups, but otherwise I'll see what happens next year! Thanks for the help everyone! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi Everyone - I'll be entering this summer as an AAE student in the College of Engineering and was hoping someone might have a line on housing or will be in need of a roommate starting this summer? I'd be flexible as to when the start date would need to be (mid-May or June), so I'm certainly open to many options. I just thought living with a redditor might at least be slightly more bearable than a total stranger. **About Me:** I'm 27 and this will actually be my second bachelors degree (ironically enough, my first is from IU). I'm working at the Calumet campus this semester finishing up what will be my \"freshman\" year. I'm fairly quiet, tidy, and, pretty much keep out of everyone's hair. Like many of you I'm big into movies, sci-fi, comics, and I enjoy building things. If there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to PM me and I'd be more than happy to answer.   **EDIT:** Sorry, I forgot to mention that I'm not looking for a sublet. I'm hoping to start looking at places soon. I live in Chicago at the moment, so I'd be making a trip down to WL to see a bunch of places, and hopefully meet some potential roommates.  **EDIT #2 (03/10/2013)** If anyone is looking for a roommate as well I'd be interested!

            "<bos> I'm a high school senior and was directly admitted to both business schools. After both the financial packages came in, Purdue was about 16k cheaper each year. I plan on majoring in finance. So I guess I'm asking is paying the extra ~60k over my 4 years worth it to go to Indiana to get the better finance degree. I feel like it's not out of the question for Krannert and Kelley majors to get near same paying jobs. From some internet searches I see that finance is definitely not one of Purdues strongest suits, so I'm just a bit unsure.  <eos> \n",

The second time around I got what I needed and my GPA is around a 3 now. I'm going into my fourth semester. Now I know that many of my fellow FYE students got their department acceptance letters over the summer. I didn't cause I didn't complete FYE. I ended up taking the classes I need to stay on track in ECE ( my desired department ). What I'm asking is if there will be a similar letter sent out during winter break, and should I have already gotten it? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have read the Reddit here for a little while and it seems like Purdue grades very hard. I want to go to graduate school or medical school (I will major in Chemistry) and GPA is important for that. It also seems like many students here just want a 4 year degree and then a job. \"Employers know that Purdue has a low GPA\" is commonly said, but my research says that further education doesn't as much leniency. I am afraid if I go to Purdue, my GPA will not be able to get into medical school or a PhD program because it will be lower than if I went somewhere else.  <eos> \n",

Today, I got a 'warning' ticket saying I don't have a B permit. WTF is this? The back of discovery lot has been C parking all year. Did they just suddenly change it on me? I guess I need to check again. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I wanted to apply for FYE, but due to a variety of reasons my only option now is to go to Purdue's Polytechnic Institute. I want to transfer to engineering, but I'm not sure if it is possible and I'm not sure how hard it is to transfer to FYE. There's also the issue of IB credit, which seems to be mostly useless if I'm planning to CODO to engineering. Here's what I have read so far. 1. I'll need to have a minimum GPA of 3.2 in three classes (math, physics, and something else) 2. The eligible classes don't seem to be on the EET plan of study, so I'd have to deviate from the plan of study. 2. If I want to CODO, I'd need to be upfront to the advisor who will help me choose classes. Any help would be greatly appreciated! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I’m a freshman in computer science and I am starting to wonder if changing course may be the only option at this point. I started off in cs with a great score on my first exam, and then started to slack off a bit and eventually barely passed it. I’m currently in CS240 and I am having a lot of difficulty finishing the labs and get an incomplete on a lot of them. Some of the concepts I hear in class that I should know are supposed to build my understanding for new concepts, but I am ending up feeling lost. I am going to try harder, as I always can improve, but I am wondering what is probably the point of no return. I was wondering if a less prestigious school for CS like IU (boo, but I’m in state) would work better for me, and if some transfer students might have some information on other schools. Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys! 3-4 weeks until finals, and Im kinda done with learning new material. Only a couple lectures in both classes and Im just kinda ready to hunker down. Why? I have nooo clue whats going on! So, Im asking you guys for help. Not so much like, save my life help, but, liek my username says, conceptshelp. Im planning on putting several hours of work into both classes a day, especially that its break right now. Im just wondering when studying, what should I look for when I know I fully understand the chapter/section worth. For MA261, theres assignments that are online that have been taken from the book. When I do those assignments, what should I look for to know I grasp the information they were testing us on? For Phys172, theres a book and online homework. Ive done like 90% of the homework, yet, do poorly on the exams. Couple questions here. 1) The equations on the tests. To get a 100% on the MC, are all the equations I need on that list? Do I need to derive anything, or does he give everything we need to succeed? 2) When doing homework in the book, should I write down every equation that was given in that chapter and use them for the questions? 3) How do I know when I grasp the information in the chapter?  Basically, Im freaking out. Not sure if its worth it though, because Ive missed the majority of quizzes/recitations in both physics and ma 261, and missed out the majority of labs in physics too. Also skipped the past wave of tests ._. Looking to get a 3.00, so I need to do damn well brilliantly on these finals. Anyone have any miracles left or words of advice? <eos> \n",

I heard I can take cs 250, 251, and 252 together if I can get the good grade and the permission. Do you guys think it will be possible to pass with 17 credits??? I'm thinking about my track between software engineering and computer graphics and visualization. If I can't make cs 250, 251, and 252 together, I'll probably have to take 4 core 3 core for last two semesters.. and 17 credits. Any tips for my schedule?? What would be the best way based on my situation? Please help!! If you guys can suggest me some cs courses, I'll be really appreciated. Thanks for reading!! <eos> \n",

My own car is currently at home, out of state, and I'm not old enough to rent a car from a rental agency. Calling an Uber is going to be north of $100 one way, taxi's even more than that. None of my friends are up to helping me out either (classes, or they don't feel like making a 3 hour round trip early in the morning). Is there any way for me to do this? Edit: Thank you all for your help. I ended up booking bus tickets to Indy, from where I'm going to take an uber to and from the interview. Those of you who offered me a ride, thank you very much, and keep being awesome. :) <eos> \n",

In this transfer, will I start a new application to be transferred, or will my current admission work, because I have heard that Purdue isn't integrated with any course.

I accepted my offer of admission to Purdue because my first choice university didn't give me a decision until after May 1st (deadline to accept Purdue offer).

I don't really know anyone at Purdue even after two years living in the dorms. My time here only consists of doing homework/studying and playing video games. The advice people give is that you just have to interact with people on your floor/classroom or just join some groups but I feel it is not that simple. I have tried the first one. I have made small talk with some people on my floor. But that is about how far it goes. They all seem to have other friends to hang out with or are not really interested. As for clubs/groups I have not joined any but I fear the same situation will occur. I don't really have any true interests(all I do is play PC games and I'm not even good) I don't think I am that socially awkward(I think). I work alright in class discussions and group work. But everyone to me is just an acquaintance. I don't really want to spend the next years doing the same thing as I am starting to get sick of it. Feels like I'm not getting the real college experience. How exactly do I go about getting real friends and do stuff with them? What are the steps I should follow? P.S: I'm an indian international student if that means anything.  <eos> \n",

If you are still experiencing an activation issue, please post your question below.* *Status Update 23-Sept 08:11 UTC -8: Unfortunately due to an unforeseen issue some students have run into a delay activating the Office ProPlus clients after download. We have investigated the issue and are currently finalizing an update to the service. In the meantime, to ensure students have a great experience we will disable new students signing up for the offer for a few hours while we deploy the update. New students regardless of eligibility will see the following message: “Sorry, your school isn’t on our list of eligible institutions. We’ll check to make sure the list is up to date, so try again in a few days…”* *Users who have installed Office on Windows have a 5-day grace period in which all features and functionality are available. After installing Office, affected Windows users can close the activation sign-in page to continue using Office until we resolve the problem. We’re sorry, but there is no workaround for Mac/iPad users.*   *We are working to update the service as soon as possible. Once the service is updated, new students will be able to sign-up and students who already installed Office (on Windows, Mac, and iPad) will be able to activate successfully.*  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Former Boilermaker here. I just got expelled for hacking into another student's computer and placing child pornography on it, among other related crimes. The fun part? PUPD investigated the issue and found no connection to me.  An anonymous report was received stating that this student had illegal images on his computer. I was then accused of hacking into his computer and putting them there (\"it isn't mine, I swear!\"). The Office of Institutional Equity decided to investigate. I was given no information about the crimes I was accused of. I responded, denying any involvement, and indicated various technological limitations that make it implausible for me to have done this. Despite this, the OIE determined that I was guilty. I was never presented with any evidence, nor was anyone able to explain how I could have committed these crimes. Only after the conclusion of the investigation was I able to see the report that the OIE compiled. According to the documents, neither PUPD nor the OIE had found any evidence linking me to these events. Instead, they reasoned that it was still \"more likely than not\" me (I'm a big, scary computer major). It was also found that the anonymous report had come from the other student's IP address (The implications of this were either not understood or ignored). Every detail of this case makes me feel outraged. This isn't Watch\\_Dogs, I can't just press X to hack into things. It's also incredibly arrogant that the university would blatantly disregard the lack of findings from the police department. PUPD employs trained professionals in criminal justice, has decades of experience, and has access to many experts and resources. But what do _they_ know, right? What's most insulting is that if anyone anywhere else was found with illegal images on their computer, and they claimed someone hacked into it and put them there, they would be laughed at. This same student had also previously made false accusations against me of unwanted sexual conduct (we have had issues with each other in the past), and spent a large portion of his freshman year trying to get his roommate kicked out of housing. Why would they listen to _him_? So here I sit, writing this message, not in a jail cell, without any criminal charges against me, expelled from a university for gross crimes I haven't committed.

What are some clubs I could join that have a lot of members? Using boiler link tells me what there is but it doesn't tell me how many members there are. If I know which ones have a lot of people I know which ones are worth looking into based on content.  By a lot I'm thinking near 100 but any other club with a good following would be interesting.  <eos> \n",

I've heard that most colleges learn pretty far to the left, but will you be looked down on for being a bit more conservative? Do professors acknowledge both sides or are most classes apolitical? Thanks.  <eos> \n",

Went through the maroon door in the South Tower and made in to the room where the window access was. However, they seemed to have blocked the windows with a wooden block to prevent them from opening. Anyone have any tips or alternative roots that can be taken? Thanks! <eos> \n",

We are unfortunately not allowed to use Purdue trademarked logos so we would like something new that still represents Purdue. Your Logo design will be credited to you and appear in a collegiate league with 64+ teams from all over the nation including Auburn, Houston, UCLA, UCSD, Kentucky, and many others.

            "<bos> So I'll keep this short - the week after break, I have to keep my car on campus for around 12 days and can't do anything about it. I'm a freshman and have no parking pass. Is there a way to get a parking pass for a short period of time or is it more cost-effective to just park the car in various spots on campus? If it's better to just park it in varying places, what're the best/safest spots for me to keep it at?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi,  I'm going to be attending Purdue as a master's student and I'm looking for off-campus housing. I've considered Purdue Village but it seems to have a really bad reputation and I think I'll dislike living at Hilltop apartments. Are there any off-campus accomodation where there's a community of Purdue students that do stuff together? I'll be an international student and I want to be able to meet new people (students) and easily hang out with a group of Purdue students.  I've taken a look at Fuse, River Market Apartments, and Wabash Landing and all three seem to have the kind of rooms I'm looking for. However, I'm not sure if there are many Purdue students at those three apartments and I'm not sure if the students at those apartments even interact with one another (e.g. I've read a review saying Purdue students at Fuse largely ignore one another unless they already knew each other). <eos> \n",

You're allowed to use 3 swipes at a time (12 items). I saw someone take an entire box of chicken ramen noodles! Here's the best part: **if you have an unlimited meal plan, you get EIGHT of these swipes PER WEEK.** Get your money's worth out of your meal plan! <eos> \n",

I’ve heard that the work load is very large which doesn’t leave a lot of time for social time and such. Even with a large workload, do students, especially freshmen, have social lives? Im not very interested in Greek Life and plan to live on campus. I’m basically being forced to since my mother worked in housing for several years in the 90s. <eos> \n",

Currently, I have AP Calc AB and BC, AP Chem, AP, Bio, AP Physics C: mechanics, AP Stat, AP US History, AP Euro, Dual Enrollment English (101 and 102), and Dual Enrollment Spanish (101 and 102). Can some list the weed out classes and/or possibly the classes I should use my AP credit. <eos> \n",

Right now, I haven't gotten any notifications whatsoever as to whether or not I'm still in this class. Hypothetical Situation: If I took this course during the summer outside of Purdue regardless of my grade, and retake the prerequisite the semester I come back, would I then not only be allowed to get a better grade, but simultaneously receive credit for both courses upon completion of that semester? <eos> \n",

I basically just randomly picked a class that sounded mildly interesting and Planet Earth it was. I was just wondering if anyone else had taken this class and if it was worth keeping on my schedule.

            "<bos> We have a calc midterm tomorrow.  Last year, fall 2017, students got a sheet with some equations/identities to use on the same midterm. This year, we won't be getting those equations/identities - the SI session professor said so. We won't get any \"cheat sheets\" for the exam at all. He said whether or not we get a cheat sheet depends on who the professor is every semester. But here's the thing - we have the same professor for calc as the students who took the class last year (fall 2017).  So our professor decided to pamper his students last year and make us struggle this year. Does this mean we will get easier problems on the midterm? Or does he just hate his class this year? <eos> \n",

I understand that each individual is supposed to make their own opinions of each fraternity, but because there are 40+ of them I was wondering if you guys could give me the quick rundown of those that are \"worth it.\" Also, I've been looking at Kappa Sigma, Triangle, Pi Kappa Phi, and Zeta Beta Tau, so specific information about them would be much appreciated. Thanks for your help. P.S. It would also be cool if you could share your frat experiences and the process. The meetings I went to about fraternities and pledging didn't explain anything. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone. I will be attending Purdue this fall as a freshman (FYE) with the intention of becoming a mechanical engineer. I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could answer. 1) As a Georgian who is not used to very cold weather, how bad are West Lafayette winters? Is buying a heavy coat or waterproof boots necessary? Do your shoes get really dirty walking around campus during winter months.  2) On the housing website, it is said that to have your bed elevated costs an additional amount, but I have seen other forums in which students have said that Purdue employees can do it for free. Which one is true? 3) I have heard that making high grades is hard at Purdue because grades are not inflated. I see myself as a relatively smart and hardworking student, so would maintaining a 3.7 or 3.8 GPA in Mechanical Engineering be extremely difficult? 4) I am interested in the BSME/MSME program. How hard is it to get into the program, and how hard is it to complete the fifth year (graduate degree).  5) How good are the Purdue dining courts? Is there one that is particularly better than the others? I will have an unlimited meal plan. 6) I am a bit confused about the AP credit transfer process If I were to exempt Calc 1 (MA 16500) first semester, would I have to take Calculus II first semester, or would I simply not take an additional class first semester? 7) My first year at Purdue will be fairly expensive (I applied very late ~ late January). Will I be able to receive more scholarship offers and receive better financial aid packages offers after freshman year if I have good grades/extracurriculars as a freshman?  8) Should I apply for a Learning Community? Is studying with your peers harder to do if you're not part of a Learning Community? Thank you to everyone and anyone who takes the time to read this and answer my questions. I really appreciate it. This is my first time using Reddit, so please excuse any mistakes I have made.  <eos> \n",

But every place I went, the people at the stalls said the same thing: you have to apply online. My question is, if the applications are all online, is there really any point of standing in line for hours at IR or SMEF?  <eos> \n",

As far as business schools are concerned, I'm aware Kelley is better, (I do not plan on majoring in finance or accounting) but I enjoyed my time at Purdue much more and didn't feel that Krannert was sub par. So,people who have experienced Krannert, what has you experience been? Are you happy with your decision? How do career fairs, internship opportunities, and job placement results look like? I would love to hear your reasons why you attended and arguments for attending Krannert.  <eos> \n",

However, I couldn't find any specific information about these classes, and I'm a bit worried about taking two languages at once... Does anyone on here have experience with these classes, or the FR and ITAL departments? I'm not sure if there are multiple FR 301 professors, but if there are, which ones would you recommend? What's the workload like? Quizzes/exams? For FR 301, is most of the class based on gaining speaking, listening, and reading comprehension skills, or does grammar make up a significant chunk? Is getting an A in language courses manageable? Thanks so much! I appreciate all and any advice :) <eos> \n",

I recently got accepted to graduate school here and I'll start this summer, after I graduate in May. I 100% plan on starting a motorcycle club at that point. In order to get the gears moving I'm thinking about two or three group rides this semester now that it's warming up outside.  I'll be bringing my FJR 1300 (silver) back to campus after spring break. That Saturday (24th) it should be in the low 50s, according to the almanac. Of course weather permitting, I'm thinking a Saturday afternoon ride. There's a nice easy twisty road west of campus and we can ride to Chauncey and get something to eat too.  Who's interested? Will definitely do this again as it continues to warm up.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I struggled with this class a few times, I dropped it the first time, failed the second time and got a D the third time. I know this seems like I can’t do well in the class, but it’s just that I did not study because of a rough year with family problems and stuff. I am confident I can get atleast an A- if I take it again, but I just realized that dropping the class is actually counted as one attempt. Is there a way I can retake this course. This course is important to me so if not, I’d be willing to take this course else where, like in a community college and transfer the credits for the course if that’s a viable option. If anyone was in the same situation and can help, thank you. <eos> \n",

A bunch of fellow classmates and I were trying to schedule a night out before graduation, but we aren't really sure what would fit us. I'm guessing not Harry's or Neon Cactus.

            "<bos> So I've posted a lot about these evil people recently... But its warranted so I'll continue. I was walking back to my apartment about a half hour ago when a walking Comcast salesman (really what???) hails me and asks if I have internet set up. I truthfully told him that I already have Metronet while quietly thinking to myself about how I've finally beaten \"The Man\". He then proceeds to say, in a sarcastic/rude tone, \" Well good luck with that this year.\" Being the bigger person I just said \"thanks\" sort of in disbelief. Thinking back I could have had a much better and more snarky response. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm going up to Chicago the weekend of 3/21-3/22 via Amtrak, and I wanted to know what I should do for parking overnight. I live on the east side of town, so I'd need to drive to get to the station. I see on the Amtrak website that they mention a small number of overnight parking spaces -- how do those work? If those are unavailable, what would be a good place to park my car near the station from Saturday morning until Sunday afternoon? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Speaking hypothetically of course... If a person is signed up to be a TA for next semester, but then does poorly on this semester's finals and is put onto academic probation, what happens? Would that person no longer be able to keep their TA job? Let's also say that the person has good grades in the subject relevant to the TA position, and that the bad grades are from unrelated classes.  Is there a university-wide policy on this? Or does it depend on the class? Or is the case where only your grade in that particular class matters. Any advice would be really appreciated.  <eos> \n",

I live in Cary with all guys and was wondering what the risks, if any, of having her come and stay a few nights. Is it a huge rule breaker? Have any of you done it? Is my best bet a hotel?

            "<bos> Hey guys I recently got accepted into Purdue computer science, however I am kinda iffy about going since I live in California and I'm not really used to the lifestyle in the Midwest. I've also heard that Purdue cs has a High drop out rate. I have lots of experience coding in the past, even had an internship at Facebook as a high school student, but those numbers still tend to scare me. Overall Purdue looks like a great option for me, just wondering what you guys think, thanks. <eos> \n",

I'm now in the process of picking housing and I'd like to know which buildings are good for freshmen, are a good value, and are relatively close to the FYE courses I'll be taking in the fall. Plus, if there's anything more I'd need to know about the housing like traditions, etc. that'd be cool also. Thanks!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Although ap tests haven't come back yet, I fairly reasonable predict myself getting a 4 or 5. This means I can potentially skip calc 12. So my question is, what are the pros and cons of this route? Is it much better/worse than the alternative? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey all, I'm a master's degree student looking to transfer into an online MS in Information Technology (or Systems) program sometime in the near future. I did some research and Purdue Online caught my eye. [The Information Technology Project Management]([url link] program in particular looks pretty promising and lines up with what I want to do. It also seems more affordable than comparable programs at Johns Hopkins and Virginia Tech that I'm considering. But in my research I found some posts in this sub that reference \"Purdue Global\" as being basically a scam school, re-branded Kaplan. Now, the program I'm interested in doesn't look like it's \"Purdue Global\" since it's linked to the real Purdue site. I want to avoid for-profits and get my MS from a well regarded university (one reason why I'm transferring out of where I am, if possible). So... does anyone have any experience with the online IT masters? Is it a part of Purdue Global or normal Purdue? If the answers are good here I'll probably get in contact with someone there to figure out the rest. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> This may sound like a stupid question but I'm an international and kinda still getting used to this.  SO, If I get a 4 or 5 in AP Calculus BC, according to the website, I'll get credits for MA 16500  MA 16600. What does that mean, I checked at you need to take these courses in the first year (for CS) so, if I get a good AP score, does that mean I can skip these classes? And, is there any other AP worth looking into?  <eos> \n",

I feel like I've exhausted most of what west lafayette has to offer, and have a car so I'm looking to spread my wings and see what the state has to offer. What's good within a 2 hour drive? Cool (not crazy expensive) places in Indy? Any neat places for a bad weather day? How about any parks except Turkey Run and Prophetstown? We're both good with just about anything, and are quirky people so let's hear all your ideas. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, Basically, I was just wondering if there are other older students on campus. This is probably just a silly fear, but I'm scared of standing out in class/cafeteria/at games. Right now I'm sitting at a 4.0, and I'm 26 years old looking to transfer when I'm 28. I was just wondering if it's going to be a little weird transferring to Purdue, and if I should just go to IUPUI. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I wanted a ship my stuff through a freight train then via ship back to my country but the USPS doesn't do that anymore? It would cost a $1000 dollars to ship it back for three tote boxes and one Walmart shipping box. <eos> \n",

Anybody have any recommendations on courses that have no homework and have interesting subject material? Only class I've taken from the subject is POL130, but I have to use it to satisfy another type of credit, unfortunately. I'd like to avoid any gender/race related course, if possible. EDIT: Is there a way that I can 'double dip' with POL130 and have it count for both my Social/Behavioral credit and Culture/Diversity? <eos> \n",

And then to replace the D+, I would retake MA 162 in the fall meaning I would be taking calc 2 and calc 3 at the same time. Has anyone heard of this/done this before?

Now, I know its Physics/Math heavy, and a hard major. I was wondering what the workload was really like? Would I still have free time, specifically on the weekends to get out and do stuff? Also, I was told FSAE is a must as it gives you a big edge with car companies. I also think it would be something I would enjoy. On there website it says the work Thursday evenings, Friday evenings and all day saturday? Is that legitimate? That seems like a bit much, judging by other school's FSAE websites. I'm not sure if I'd want to commit THAT much time. Just wanted some info, sorry if this was the wrong place to post this. Thanks <eos> \n",

Just to be clear: I posted this in r/lafayette and got so much hate for not just going to the public pools. I'm actually on the lookout for private pools that are primarily deserted but not locked. I'm not trying to start anything; I just notice that there are so many pools around where the residents don't even bother to go, and I just want to sun bathe and swim a bit without tons of kids around splashing me and asking me for stuff.

I won't be having a car with me, and neither will any friends at IU. The only thing I've found is one company that offers bus rides to and from each campus, but round trip it's $60, which is a lot. Some adults have told me that when they went to school, there were always people posting on bulletin boards about taking a weekend trip to another campus and looking for people to carpool with to split gas money. Is that something that happens at Purdue? And if not, does anyone know any other options that don't involve spending $60 for one trip? Edit: Guys, I'm really not saying that the bus is overcharging and a shitty company or anything. I'm saying that it's a lot of money for a college student without a job, and I'm looking for other options. I'm sorry for coming off that way. <eos> \n",

Just search Catia V5 student edition on google. Make sure you download the 2017 version cause I believe that’s what they use on campus.

            "<bos> I am coming in as a freshman this year going into Human Centered Design (UX) at the polytechnic school. The way the class was originally described to me it was psychology and engineering kinda meshed. That sounded awesome! I spent sometime looking it up and I quickly decided that I wanted to major in this. I get signed up for my classes and I'm taking CGT 10101 and CGT 11800 (foundations of computer graphics technology, and foundations of imaging technology.) I start going through the syllabus and I notice lots of sketching and drawing. As well as a recommendation for a computer drawing pad and a required sketchbook! I am not an artist not a bit and I'm freaking out! Don't get me wrong I figured there would be some sketching or designing going into this major, but this seems like a lot more sketching. Am I in the wrong major? I loved how The Purdue website described this major but based on this class (which is a core class) it seems like a royally fucked up. Does anyone have any insight with this major or know anyone who's in this major? I am working to meet with my advisor to ask more questions but I'm also reaching out on Reddit because I spend lots of time here. Thank you for any feedback. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Apparently the cost per meal swipe on the block plan approaches $17... the hell is up with this? Using the costs on the housing rates page a 3 bedroom apt. is $4608 a year for the room and $9216 for a room and meal plan. $4608 for the meal plan alone, subtract $450 for the dining dollars, and you're left with about $16.90 * 246 meals for the year. I emailed the director of dining services who confirmed that this cost is the highest among the meal plans because you're allowed to swipe for other people and carry meals over from week to week, etc... but this is such a terrible deal I can't think of any reason whatsoever you'd want to use this instead of paying the GUEST PRICE for meals which is around $11 for students. <eos> \n",

Thoughts? We definitely need some experienced members! Do any of you guys have a printer of your own OR have proficient CAD experience and would want to help out? PM me and we'll talk!

I have no idea, but whatever the case is, whoever was in charge of finding this night’s entertainment should be fired immediately. They should have known that placing Andy Gross after a talk about sexual assault would not go over well with the audience. The University should be ashamed to field such a disaster. Andy Gross is certainly talented but in the context of Freezone, his performance was totally out of place and borderline uncomfortable to watch at times. So in summary, don’t blame Gross, that’s just his job. The organizers are responsible for this!  <eos> \n",

Currently it says \"Unrelated to Purdue/spam\", think that's good enough? Maybe something more strongly worded? Also, I removed the hover state on the main page. You know how you used to have to hover to see the links other than 'comment'? Well I checked it out on a phone and, uh... hover states are annoying as hell on mobile. Sorry about that. :( Finally, [see this image]([url link] I would like a Purdue styled 'P' to replace those two icons. Maybe one with a question mark and one with an exclamation point?

My stat lab was like that last year and worked out great because I would have missed my bus otherwise. This year I've got a class right after on the other side of campus with assigned seating (which pisses me off, this is college, not fucking middle school) and mandatory attendance. Also, how is this class in general? Thanks! Edit: Nevermind, found out the answer I needed!

I have been working as a Graphic Designer / UX Developer for the last 5 years and I wish to pursue Masters at Purdue. I was wondering whether I should apply for MS in Computer Science or complete fourth year BS in Computer Science? My TOEFL score is 113 and GRE is 313. I have a WES Evaluated GPA of 3.3 (my university doesn't use gpa). According to the purdue's website, I am missing out on the minimum GPA requirement. I am very interested in programming and I was wondering whether they would accept me? <eos> \n",

Problem is I don't really know/seem to change my mind every other week. I haven't had an internship or anything, so without any industry experience and only a few classes under my belt it's hard to make a guess at what interests me.  I've made a list of the upper div classes that interest me and based on that I've thought about software engr, systems programming, security,  DBIS (DBIS and soft engr a little less than the other two but still enough I've considered them, p much all other tracks are uninteresting to me). Upperclassmen, what made you decide to pursue a certain track and how did you end up feeling about it? I've heard that tracks really don't make a huge difference to recruiters and what matters is just the classes you've taken and how you've applied yourself in/outside them based on your interests. I'm the kind of person who always needs to have a plan tho, so I'm trying to narrow it down now even if I change my mind later :p I also have the scheduling flexibility and the motivation (for now) to specialize in more than one area, and excluding DBIS I know there's a lot of overlap in the ones I've listed which seems to make it viable but by all means correct me if I'm wrong :p just wondering about perspective from people who've been around the block with upper div CS classes. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

Registering your purdue.edu email to Facebook gives you access to certain 'Purdue-only' Facebook groups. Its really helpful for hearing about callouts, connecting with others in your major, and just hearing about Purdue news.  My favorite group is 'Free and For Sale' because people are always selling stuff for CHEAP on there. I suggest everyone to join it, I've been able to save boatloads on books and materials. <eos> \n",

Right now I was thinking Harry's @ ~ 6:00 Neon Cactus Nine Irish Where Else Jakes Brother's So what other bars are a \"must visit at least once\" at Purdue? Thanks!

My roommate and I recently learned that we can loft our beds so instead of having the standard Cary small double bunk bed layout, we could have separate beds with more room underneath. I was wondering if anybody out here has used this setup before in the Cary small double rooms, and if they could give me their opinions on this particular layout as opposed to the standard layout. We're kind of worried that the low ceiling (8') and extremely narrow room (we calculated that with two lofted beds there would be 2.3' in between the beds) might impact the actual usable area of the room somewhat, but if anyone has experience with this setup, I would be grateful if you could share your impressions. Thank you for reading!  <eos> \n",

I'm thinking (as some of you suggested) I'll go to Hawkins for a semester to get used to a new campus, school, country etc. then move out into an apartment. Thanks! <eos> \n",

While my gpa can adjust for the shitshow of a possible C- or D, I was wondering if there is a minimum required grade to be considered for credits. Tried looking up on the course catalog and I don’t see 302 as a pre req for any courses (atleast the ones I need). While I credit the ECE department for providing me with 24/7 anxiety and hopelessness, I do understand that the content is important for ECE majors. However I’m heavily focused on EE and I really hate the stuff in it (hence doing bad). Anyone been in this position, wanting to shed some light?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> (Incoming freshman) So due to some circumstances, I will be entering the semester with just enough $ to pay for tuition + housing (16k). This obviously leaves me no money to buy necessities for the dorm as well as text books etc. I finally convinced my parents to cosign a private loan for me but I'm concerned if that will arrive in time before 8/24. How long do private loans usually take to disburse? Another option that I'm thinking of is to use one of those Purdue payment plans where I would put maybe 10-12k down initially and then pay a couple thousand every few months through the semester since the interest is negligible. This would allow me to buy the stuff I need. I would assume that this would be the safer route as the private loan money would have surely cleared by the first payment plan due date (9/21). Does anyone have any experiences with the payment plans? Any insight would be appreciated . <eos> \n",

Does anyone have any suggestions of easy CS electives? <eos> \n",

I AP'ed out of freshman comp (with AP Lang) but my AP Lit score wasn't high enough to get out of a sophomore class. Right now I'm considering ENGL 20500 which is Intro to Creative Writing or ENGL 26400 which is the Bible as Literature, though I was wondering if any of you had comments on those classes or other suggestions that would make me look shinier for med school applications.  <eos> \n",

Both the rocks and the heater can't take that abuse and there's no point in doing so in the first place since no one I've noticed knows how to sauna properly anyway.

I'll be coming from California so if there's any part of the subleasing process that involves me having to come to campus before the semester starts, that will cause some problems.

I am starting to get into it more and my wife likes to play too because it is easier on her knees. I know Purdue has some courts right by the corec and out at Pickett park, but are there any others? Any bar leagues or anything? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My heavy and old HP envy 17 is at its last legs, thinking of switching to macbook, but should I get the air or the pro with retina?128 gb or 256gb? I don't want to waste unnecessary money for something I won't notice the difference since you know we are broke college kids but don't want a crappy thing either lol. A little bit about my usage, mostly taking notes in class, homework, writing papers, research when needed ,browsing and Netflix. Accounting and management major if relevant. I have an iPad air and iPhone 6, so I'm afraid I might dislike the non retina on the MacBook Air since I heard you can't go back once u tried it lol. Also should I buy the office for Mac or just use iWork's? Afraid of compatibility problems for homework, lecture slides etc. any advice would be greatly appreciated! I'm leaning towards the MacBook Pro with retina 128gb.  <eos> \n",

TLDR; I have noisy/annoying suitemates/roommate and I really would like to switch to a singles room so I can be more comfortable and study better (hawkins,first street, etc.). 1. Is this possible? 2. How much might this cost/what will the transition be like? I feel like if I stay this whole year, I will lose my mind. I haven't talked to my RA yet, I was planning on doing that tomorrow. I bet she will have the answer, I just wanted some preliminary advice, maybe from someone who has done this sort of thing before or knows someone who has. <eos> \n",

I know it isn't a requirement and they'd probably still view your app without it, but I feel like recs are a staple of my app. Naviance said they'd accept one but collegeconfidential said they won't accept any.  So what's Purdue's rec policy? How many recs do they really accept? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I was denied admission to the FYE program due to my utter mistake of applying late to Purdue, and now I've been placed into the Exploratory Studies program at Purdue. Now, I'm not too interested in spending five years at Purdue, especially since I will be paying out of state tuition. Is it possible that I could complete the credits required by FYE in my year as an Exploratory Studies, and then move into the College of Engineering? I've heard of the CODO into FYE, but that seems to confuse me a lot more. Also, I looked into the FYE Plan of Study and CODO, and they both outline Math and Physics as a general requirement, and I have AP Credits for both Math 16500  16600 and Physics 17200, from AP Physics C and Calculus BC. Thanks a lot in advance for your time <eos> \n",

I’m pretty sure I got killed by today’s quiz and I never seem to do well on them despite getting an A on the first midterm exam.

Does anyone know how much quizzes matter so long as you have an A in the tests category and a near perfect in homework? <eos> \n",

When it became apparent that I was going to be dropped, I started jumping through hoops to get a partial withdraw, and they've just now gotten back to me. I've been so stressed out about this, and I literally punched the air in excitement when I read the email from the Registrar. What makes it even better is that I had decided to tell my parents tomorrow, which was guaranteed to be completely awful. Dodged two very scary bullets here. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Whether its in a hallway in an academic building, on a sidewalk or and most importantly, in a dining area, if you want to stop for any reason please move to the side. Do not take up the entire area, people are trying to get some where. Move to the wall or go to an area where it is larger and less people are actively walking in that area. All you are doing is being a major pain in the ass because you lack the common sense to understand that it is not the best idea to try to take a narrow walkway over and use it as your gathering spot. Your parents arent here to remind you to get out of the way, you are an adult, have a little common sense. It's not that difficult and I promise you, it doesnt take any extra effort. Itll take more effort for you to let someone by and then restart your conversation that was interrupted by someone trying to walk in an area where people walk and not just stand around chatting. <eos> \n",

Today I received an email from the department saying something along the lines of, \"Congrats, you've been recommended for admission and graduate appointment...you are invited to join our program as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.\" So my question is...did I get in as a PhD student or did I get in as a TA?

Obviously this isn't restricted to high schoolers either. If anyone has a question about Purdue, just ask! I can probably answer it.

I do not game whatsoever, but want a quality mobo that has some top of the lines features. I want the Z97 chipset.

He wants to know if previous years have curved exams to any degree, but I honestly didn't pay enough attention when I was in the course to give him a straight answer. Anyone happen to know the exam curve policy? I imagine Prof. Dunsmore is still heading up the course, so it probably hasn't changed. <eos> \n",

Unfortunately, as a 1st gen student I've had almost no exposure to this type of thing at home (parents don't have jobs requiring this kind of attire, so they're not able to help much with this), and so I need some advice:  Where would you recommend I go to get business/professional type clothes (for things like interviews, networking events) for a decent price? Preferably somewhere local to Purdue.  Also, any advice on what is/isn't appropriate to wear to a interviews, meetings with professors, etc would be a huge help. Tl;dr: Where can a girl go to get professional clothes at a good price? What should I get?  <eos> \n",

One of the options I'm contemplating is getting a second degree in CS to have the added security later on. I was curious if you guys knew anything about how Purdue does second degrees after graduation. Could any of my past credits transfer or count towards a CS degree even though I've graduated? I'm just looking for ways for this to not be another full 4 years of school. Any opinions or thoughts are helpful. Thanks. <eos> \n",

For ECE 302 I have the option for Stanley H Chan, Chih-Chun Wang, and Gelfand. I'm going to take Chan because I had Wang and while a good teacher, I failed his class hard because he focuses so much on the math. As for Gelfand I have heard he is horrible. I was wondering if anybody has info on Chan? As for 265, I have no idea who is good, there are like 10 different professors for it and I just wanted to know who is recommended/hated. <eos> \n",

In fact I'd be quite uncomfortable sharing, so which are the halls that have single occupancy rooms and which would you wise ol' redditors recommend? - I like to smoke a fair amount of herb, what is the security like around campus and are they particularly harsh if you're caught? -What is the university ethos as a whole, is it all about academic excellence or is there time to actually do stuff as well?  Any response would be most welcome. Peace <eos> \n",

            "<bos> [Original post \\(from 3 years ago\\)]([url link] A few years ago someone created a java program that sits in your system tray (on both windows and mac) and notifies you as soon as any specified course section that you have selected has an open spot (no guarantees that it will even happen but it will notify you if it ever does). This comes in very handy (especially the first week of the semester) to add a course that was previously full but someone has dropped, or to switch to a more desirable section that may have been previously full. This program has helped me on about 4 occasions while still at Purdue and I have several friends which it has helped as well; I'm just sharing so that more people can get use out of it now since most that knew about this have likely graduated and moved on or don't frequent this sub anymore. Even if you don't need to use it now, it wouldn't hurt to download or bookmark it for future use, you never know when it could help you out. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> First and foremost, I gotta clarify that I have no knowledge on Greek community although I finished my high school here in the states (I came from foreign country) while I hear a lot of bad reputation like hazing, underage alcohol consumption, etc. On the other hand, I heard that Purdue's greek community is quite affluential as well. I see that the university oversees the communities on activities but I think there would be \"real\" life that goes behind of the management.  Is it really beneficial to join greek community in reality? or is it just an optional thing to do?  Please share your experience honestly if you are indulged.    <eos> \n",

Who are your favorite and least favorite bus drivers on the campus routes?  I must start with the crazy guy on the Ross-Ade.

            "<bos> Hello students! Are you bored with all your classes and stressed out from exams? Come join the Boiler League of Tag for this semester's edition of Humans versus Zombies! **Game Week is the the week of April 2.** HvZ is a week long, campus wide game of tag that simulates the zombie apocalypse that we all know is coming. Players separate into two groups, the Humans, and the Zombies. Zombies attempt to tag humans to turn them into zombies, while humans defend themselves with Nerf blasters and socks in attempt to survive the week.  HvZ is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had on Purdue's campus. Nothing is quite like pelting strangers with foam darts as they come charging up the Engineering Mall, tagging any Human in sight. If you've been looking to play or want to see what it's all about, come to one of our **callouts listed below:** [Callout Poster]([url link] March 22, 7pm @ PHYS 223 March 23, 7pm @ PHYS 223 March 29, 7pm @ PHYS 223 If you can't make any of the callouts, email us at boilerleagueoftag@gmail.com. We'll also have an information table set up around campus next week. Bring your friends, your roommates, or anyone you want to pelt with Nerf darts. The more people that join, the more fun HvZ becomes. On behalf of the Boiler League of Tag, we hope to see you all there!  <eos> \n",

This means that if I want to visit home at all this semester I have to do it over a weekend. I've looked into bus/train travel but because I basically have to go through Chicago either option will take at least a full day of travel each way, which isn't practical for a weekend at home.  I'd love to rent a car Friday night, drive home, and bring it back Sunday, but I'm 18. Are there any places in/around lafayette that rent to 18yr olds?

My grades from IU were not that good, but since getting my first degree (in Neurosci) I have been taking classes in CS and have a 3.5 GPA. She said that it seems that I did not complete 2 cs/math courses at Purdue and this required for ppl coming back for a second bacc in the CS dept. She recommended that I apply again, however to the College of Sci (undecided). I'm pretty sure this means applying for Exploratory Studies. Has anyone done this and then switched over to CS? Is it hard getting classes in the CS dept if you are an ESP student? Would like to hear experiences... <eos> \n",

I have to wonder out loud, am I screwed if some of my quiz scores are kinda low, or is a comeback possible if I crack down for the actual exam (my first is next week). I've been doing fine on the homework, but it seems during the actual quiz I had made stupid mistakes, or found out I didn't understand something as well as I thought I did. TL;DR - I feel I'm struggling, any tips for studying/How severely in your experience do quizzes foreshadow exam scores/class scores? <eos> \n",

Including credits in Fall 2018, I applied 124 credits, which is more than 120(120 required for CS).  And all course categories icons are \"Complete\" and \"Complete except for classes in-progress\". Why is it not 100%? Is it supposed to be 98% before I finish Fall 2018? What are the degree process bars before you guys start your final semester? Are they all 100% before you begin? <eos> \n",

Although it currently seems like I'll get a 5 on both AP exams, I feel like I don't understand angular momentum, Gauss' Law, or amperes law well enough. Do think I should skip any physics classes?

I'm looking at doing a study abroad in Australia through a university there and I'm curious if any of you guys have done a study abroad in Australia before? How should I go about getting scholarships for the study abroad, and should I apply now or wait until finals are over and I have my grades set in stone? <eos> \n",

I hit my brakes so that you wouldn't connect with my front fender. My gentle honk and your shrug of indifference are all that it took. If you want to get together sometime to discuss the finer tips of bicycle safety or to talk about your suicidal tendencies I'm here, so just message me, please. In all seriousness, you ran a stop sign and almost hit a car, you could have been seriously injured and been responsible for the damage to my vehicle. That would have sucked for you.

            "<bos> Do not use First Act moving. This business is a sham and runs completely under the table. Intentionally works in ways to avoid creating a paper trail. The owner of the business, Jimmy T, is a known drug user and operates primarily in cash and does not own any of its own equipment. Jimmy T also tries to avoid having a paper trail even more by having three different pre-paid cell phones. I would not be surprised if him or this company was ever audited, the auditor would find years of unpaid taxes. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> A few days ago, I build the site [Matchly.co]([url link] to help students at Purdue find apartments for next year. The response I've had these past few days have been overwhelming and wanted to share this with the reddit community as well. Matchly helps students find the best housing by taking the amenities, location and price range and giving them the top three recommendations for housing. We work with the property managers from several apartments around campus and secure the best rates for students that use Matchly. Matchly.co was built out of frustration as a bunch of friends and I had no idea where to stay next year.  BTW- looking for people to help with this project, so if anyone has ideas/questions, please reach out!  Some behind the scenes of how I set up the website + platform in under an hour for less than $10: \\-Bought the domain (matchly.co) off Namecheap for \\~$8 \\-Used [carrd.co]([url link] to create the website, developed by indie developer ajlkn ([[url link] Already had a subscription from a past project, so no cost to use. Includes hosting. \\-Used Mailgun's free tier to set up custom domains (xyz@matchly.co) for free by routing them through Gmail. If anyone would like to know how to do this lmk! \\-Used Mailchimp to automatically send out an automated personalized email once a student fills out the form. Mailchimp also stores all student contact information as well.  \\-Used a custom Google form for the questionnaire. Simple is better!  \\-Let me know if anyone needs advice/help on setting up something similar! <eos> \n",

I've been heavily looking into dorm living since I live pretty far away from Purdue.  * How's the internet, most importantly? Any decent for gaming or browsing? I can live without games, but god help me if I can't check reddit.  * I'm looking into various fields, but one field I was interested in was Animation (2D/3D). Does Purdue offer anything good in that regard? I checked the course catalogue but I wasn't too sure. I haven't gotten the chance to talk to a councilor yet, but I was just too eager to wait to ask some questions. Thanks for reading!  <eos> \n",

I had a few questions, and it would be amazing if you guys could help me out. 1. I was looking to lease a car/buy a 2nd hand car. Are there any reliable dealers around West Lafayette? 2. If I have a car, should I look for apartments closer to campus? I was reading that free parking is only available if I live a certain distance from campus. If so, how far from campus should I find an apartment. 3. As I am an international student, I would prefer having a furnished or semi-furnished apartment. I would prefer having a one-bed-one-bath or a two-bed-two-bath layout. Do you guys have any suggestions as I have just begun the apartment hunt. And the options seem overwhelming. Thanks a lot guys. <eos> \n",

So, I was hoping some of you other students who may have been in the same situation can offer a little something about a few of these places. I read most of the threads previously submitted and thought RiverWalk Apartments looked pretty promising (fiber and not far from campus!), but here are the other ones I've found that seem OK: 1. Whispering Winds 2. Cambridge Estates 3. Georgetown South 4. Deerfield Commons 5. Timber Edge Estates 6. Beau Jardin 7. Mayfair Village 8. Chauncey Village 9. Village Square 10. The Bluffs 11.

            "<bos> First off, throwaway for obvious reasons. (tl;dr skip to the questions) I'm a current freshman who's very involved on campus already, so my free time is at a minimum. I'm also in Engineering so my coursework is very heavy. That being said, after seeing the Greek system over the course of a year I've decided that it's really something I really want to try. My only real concern is my academics and the time commitment. I know that they say \"you'll just work on your time management skills\", but the position I'm in now is already a 25 hr/week commitment so I've had a lot of that already. It will be slightly less time consuming next year, but I'm positive that it would take away from pledging. Which brings me to my questions: 1. Are fraternities flexible with pledge activity attendance? 2. Are brothers ever actually concerned about my academic performance, or do they just say that during rush? 3. If schoolwork becomes too much, will I just get dropped? If you don't want to post anything in the public/start a flame war, please PM me. Knowing what house you're in when you answer would be awesome for rush next year. <eos> \n",

I applied for a change of major for First Year Engineering but was rejected. I am an out of state student, so I am paying a lot of money to go to this school and only plan on going here if I can pursue mechanical engineering. Can I take the FYE classes as a freshman and then apply to be in mechanical engineering at the end of the year as would a student actually in FYE? Do I have to take Economics related classes as a freshman and then wait until the end of the year to apply to be in FYE as a sophomore? I would really appreciate if anyone could help answer my questions. I have checked Purdue's websites and am still confused about what my next steps should be. Thanks.  <eos> \n",

I was thinking of doing EPICS or Network LC for CoE but will joining these require a lot of extra work and how beneficial is it overall? I'm prepared to work hard but I want it to pay off. If I **do** join a learning community is it recommended that I enter their residence hall or does it not matter very much? Second is which residence hall would you all recommend? From browsing the sub a little, it seems that Earhart, Shreve, and Cary all seem to have a good atmosphere. I'd prefer some luxuries but I just want a pleasant amount of room and a good community.

I live off campus and I intend to take the shuttle at 4:30am tomorrow morning from the Union to the Indy airport. It'd be most convenient for me if I could park in the Wood Garage (I have an A pass) and leave my car there from Thursday morning until I return Sunday. I'm just not sure if I should expect a ticket or tow for leaving my car parked there for so long. Does anyone have any experience to share that might be relevant? Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

Edit: Thanks for the advice guys. I tried to join a group of people playing pool in the rec room, and I didn't understand half of what they were saying, and the exchange sizzled out, so I went outside and walked around some of the campus. Came back and briefly met my roommate but gave him and his parents privacy to unpack. Now I'm in the lobby back at square one. I find it so difficult to meet new people. I'm wasting time and opportunities as I type this. Hopefully tomorrow during BGR will be better since I'll have an organized plan and will be forced to speak to people.   Edit #2: You guys are so supportive, I freaking love it. Haven't spoken to anyone still, lol, but you make me feel a little more relaxed. Thanks <eos> \n",

I remember Drew Brees and losing the Rose Bowl, I remember Glenn Robinson and losing in the elite 8, I was there for Hummel and his first ACL tear. I've given so much for this university, and losses like this one kill me. I hate to complain, but damn, I'm gonna give myself a heart attack.

I also called chase and they said Purdue forced them out as they leased those spaces. Now those spaces are just empty (Remove the competition). What I find interesting is the amount of overlap between the Purdue Board and the Credit Union board and I'm unsure how this isn't a conflict of interest.  <eos> \n",

Most packaging can be recycled by your dorm hall or apartment complex. If you go to Starbucks, ask for a coffee without a lid (if you're drinking it there!). Do you really need a plastic bag for those Juul pods? Probably not.  Just be mindful of how you consume... I'm tired of seeing trash on our campus. Boiler Up. <eos> \n",

It allows me to connect to the VPN, but when I try to print to the iTap it say the documents are pending and the printer is offline. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?

            "<bos> I know it's mostly my fault but for some reason I keep losing my Purdue ID. I don't even lose my credit card or debit card, but this cheap piece of plastic somehow keep slipping out whether it's from my hand or my pocket or even the little card holder I got for my phone after losing it the second time. I'm really peeved because the first time, it wasn't that long of a walk but when I retraced my steps the card was already gone, probably because someone picked it up even though I immediately went back to check. I waited 3 days before giving up and getting a new one because I was wasting money on food rather than just using my meal swipes and the inconvience was painful. Second time I lost it I just bought a new one immediately because I feel like the wait is not worth it. I waste more money waiting for my card back because of the potentially wasted meal swipes, and there's no guarantee when I get my card back. The third time- which I didn't even think was possible because I was always making sure I had it but I look away one second and it's gone all of a sudden.... I retraced my steps and I couldn't find it. So either I dropped it on the bus or someone picked it up... I know they're doing a good deed and there isn't a good way to tell how long a card has been dropped but it's really annoying when I could have just dropped it, realised a minute after, went back but it's already gone. I think I'm just mostly frustrated right now because I keep wasting money on this stupid piece of plastic and I am trying my hardest not to lose it but I keep losing it somehow even when I'm consciously aware. I don't know if people normally just wait to see if the office has their ID but I really don't waste more money than I have to.  <eos> \n",

They keep creating new accounts, adding bots, etc. They've bypassed Gort and we don't want to get to the point where we have to start kicking everyone we don't intimately know.

I was admitted to Purdue's MS program in Aerospace Engineering (AAE), and am very excited about the opportunity. I was flown out for a graduate recruitment event in February, met with a few professors in my area, and generally had a great time. I think Purdue is the best program for me. However, I was not admitted with an assistantship and was not offered one after the recruitment event. When I spoke with professors, they indicated that: 1. Most incoming MS students are not offered TA positions, since they are based on research performance during the first semester. 1. There are other opportunities in other departments (Math, Eng. Ed.) but they are hotly contested. 1. You can get a job as a graduate assistant on campus that will waive tuition and provide a stipend, but these are also hard to get. I recently received a 1/2 time TA offer from Penn State beginning on arrival, which would cover tuition and provide a stipend. I really want to attend Purdue, and have applied for assistantship positions with Math, Eng. Ed, and Armstrong Hall, but won't learn if I've been picked for any of them until after the April 15th deadline. Do any of you know what kind of outlook an incoming MS student has when it comes to securing funding? If I knew that I stood a good chance at getting it for my 2nd semester onwards, I think that would be enough to remove all doubts about accepting Purdue's offer of admission. Purdue's website says that 65% of AAE graduate students are funded, but I don't know what percentage of MS students contribute towards that number.

A little back story, I grew up in Canada and finished high school in Northwest Indiana.

I am going to be starting at Purdue next year, and I plan on studying Biomedical Engineering.

I've had experience playing with jazz combos around town, have won golds at state solo and ensemble, and I regularly practice a variety of styles as well as improvisation.

I\\'m scared of graduating and moving on to the \"real world\". I know it sounds crazy but it\\'s true. I graduate on Saturday along with thousands of others who deserve it.

Rather than actually testing your knowledge and competency with any modicum of respect, the exams are written to play fucking tricks with your mind.

No idea how many PP3's are reapplying.    The current application pool is the 2017 group. If you want some stats from the last two years I've got them. Accepted in 2015 were 82% Purdue pre-pharm (124 out of 151 accepted, 189 West Lafeyette applicants total). Accepted in 2016 were 81% Purdue pre-pharm (122 of 152, 171 West Lafayette applicants). Definitely a strong bias toward those who did their pre-pharmacy at purdue. Acceptance rate for PP3's is said to be somewhere around 65%, but I can't find my original source to confirm. Average GPA in both years was north of 3.5 as is expected.  The statistics don't give a breakdown as to who received interviews. What is known is there were 570 applicants in 2015 and 489 in 2016.   Out of state applicants are pretty well out of luck. 2016 had 4 out of 258 out of state applicants enter the program.    Hopefully these favorable statistics have made things a bit less worrisome for you. Try not to think about it for the next month. Focus on classes.

During Precalculus/Trigonometry, I remembered it. So, I shouldn't have that much trouble re-memorizing it. I also used to know everything about ellipses and hyperbolas in Algebra 2.

The Lease goes from August 9th, 2013 to July 31st, 2014 and rent is $475 a month. The deposit is also $475, and the only utilities that aren't included are electric, cable, and internet. One thing to note is that rent payments start on June 1st, 2013 and end on May 1st, 2014. My current lease runs until the end of July 2013, so I would have to be paying two rent payments a month during the summer, which is why I can no longer afford the new lease. <eos> \", '<bos> I’m in the polytechnic school..

It was originally designed for students of my own school (Northeastern University), but I recently added a handful of other schools, including Purdue. Briefly, what it does is notify you at the exact moment a spot opens up in a previously full class section.

This upcoming spring I plan to take an easier course-load to prepare for the dental admission test (DAT) which I will take in May. So far for the spring I am planning on taking a total of 13 credits. However, 9 of these credits are BIOL 286 Introduction to Ecology and Evolution, BIOL 241 Genetics and Molecular Biology (which I have heard is crazy hard) and CHM 256/25501 Organic Chemistry 2 with lab.

I still want to, however, to save myself the chore of having to go through that class. I checked the requirements to test out of it on the main site, and I was curious if the only opportunities to do so is during the STAR sessions during the summer.

I am currently a sophomore studying in CAU (China Agricultural University) in the specialty of Environmental Engineering. I completed my application for ENRE (Environmental  Natural Resources Engineering in Agricultural  Biological Engineering Department) program of the Fall semester on February 25. There are a few red flags that make me hesitant about it. First, courses associated with engineering between U.S.A. and China is a little different and I'm confused if I could satisfy the strict first-year course requirements in Purdue. Secondly, my present GPA (3.49) and TOEFL score (92) are not very high and I'm not sure how much weight my grades carries in the application process. Third, the deadline (April 1) for the fall semester application is coming and I am wondering how long Purdue will give me a response. These concerns have caused me to ask you all that have participated in ENRE or ABE what was your experience like and how long did it take for your response? Is the ENRE application very competitive for international transfer students like me?  Thank you so much for your help! <eos> \", '<bos> Congratulations you are a freshman at Purdue. You worked hard to get here and now you have to work even harder to stay here. Times will get tough, but just remember you are a Boilermaker and every other student here has been in the same situation you are. Push through it. The Ten Commandments:  For fucks sake don\\'t say \"I\\'m a sophomore by credit\" etc.  Thou shall not wear thy BGR lanyard after BGR is over.  Study hard but don\\'t forget to have fun.  Get to know your professor, they are people too. If they at least know your face, it will help you later on.  Be social! Never again in your life will you be around so many people your age with similar interests. You will make friends for life!  Never wear anything IU. No explanation needed.  Go to sporting events! The teams work hard and every bit of support helps.  Thou shalt not wear thy varsity jacket. Those achievements are from high school. Achieve more and don\\'t just relive the glory days!  Upperclassmen are here to help! We were all freshman at one point and it is okay to ask questions. Everyone will be more than willing to show you where classes are etc.  Be proud to be a Boilermaker! We\\'ve been to the moon, have a Super Bowl winning QB alumni, and we aren\\'t IU. What more could you want?  If you follow these ten steps you too will be a succesful Boilermaker. Have a fun year. Boiler Up, Hammer Down!...and fuck IU.  <eos> ', \"<bos> Currently working (homework, etc.) back at my on-campus dorm over the summer but the wooden chair that comes with the dorm is really painful and doesn't provide a lot of cushioning for my bony ass.

I'll probably end up going to grad school, so that's something to keep in mind.  If everything was equal, I think I'd go to Rose, but it's a bit too far and a bit too expensive for me.  I think at this point I'm leaning towards Valpo because I live rather close and already know some people there and have stuff I can do over there, I like the campus, and I like the smaller classes. However, I'm a bit worried about getting there and being overwhelmed with overly religious people. It isn't really a big deal there if you don't actively seek it out, but I'm not too sure about it.  Purdue's (strangely) virtually the same net cost as Valpo for me, so that's not a factor between the two.

A little background to get some understanding. I am interning in the quality engineering department. I really have very little coding experience, so hoping someone here might have some ideas. I was recently accepted into aero, but my internship is just a general engineering internship.  The company manager has asked me to create a way to prioritize all parts coming into the inspection room. He wants a way to have the inspectors work only on the parts needed as a priority, then move to priority b, then c, and so forth. This priority scale changes weekly and sometimes even daily depending on what final product needs to be shipped to inventory after inspecting. For example, a work order has come in for a raptor. The manufacturing department will go to supply for all parts needed to create a raptor. Supply comes to quality to restock after a full inspection is attained. The question is how to best create a way to continually prioritize the parts coming in to quality inspection as needed by supply and manufacturing? Right now the inspectors get an excel sheet and they have to go thru this sheet for each part as they come in to see where it belongs. The parts come into inspection randomly, with very little rhyme or reason. One day they get 100 different parts that will go to any number of final projects orders. So, they are asking me to come up with a way for the inspectors to know which of the 100 plus parts are more important and needed quicker instead of just doing them one by one.  Any ideas or current programs out there that may give an insight to a way I can help the company achieve their goal. Their final goal would be as the part comes in, the inspector barcodes or types the part into a computer, which gives the priority level. Then the inspectors can work only on certain priority items first before moving to secondary items.  <eos> ', \"<bos> Hey fellow boilermakers, just found out about this subreddit, so here is a story and some question. Back when I was in Purdue (ECE class of 05, I am old, I know), when I was taking intro-level physics for Engineering major (I think it is Phys 152, it's been a while). There was ALWAYS a streaker during exams.   One time during the 2nd midterm the guy even have 'F=ma' written on his buttcheeks, it was fucking awesome. The best part was, during the final, since the huge amount of examinees, they have to host the exam in Mackey Arena. And the TAs/Professors are well prepared this time. They actually have all the TAs came and guard the entrance/exit, and we all knew what was coming (the streaker came to every single exam without fail). And sure enough, he showed up with nothing, but this time he had a cape. It was freaking sweet. The TAs didn't hesitate for a single second, all of them launched into action, I stopped writing/calculating for a second as I know this will culminate to nothing but sheer epicness. And the streaker knew what is going on, as he started to make his round around the venue (it was a basketball arena FYI, it was by no mean a small place), and now almost ALL TAs (including the ones guarding the exit) were on his tail, and that's exactly what he wanted. As soon as he saw that, he sped up and RAN right out of the stadium and never to be seen again, the crowd cheered and laughed until the TAs reminded us we are still taking the exam.   Everyone wonders who this mysterious streaker was, as he had provided us so much joy during the soul-crushing hours of exams. But as far as I know, no one knew who he was.  It was a great story, which I still tell some of my friend (he wrote F on his left cheek, = sign in the middle, and ma on the right cheek) as a great party story. Also, the guy must have ran for the track team or something since he managed to out-ran EVERYONE in the stadium, every time. So who is this hero? An alum/senior? Anyone here knew or have any hint? If any of you guys still in engineering major, have this happened to your class? Any other zany stories during your time in Purdue?  <eos> \", '<bos> Hi all!

The challenge is currently in round 4 and Purdue Engineering is one of the 4 remaining universities left. The other 3 universities are Cornell, Caltech, and Georgia Tech. The way the Bracket Challenge works is, the university that receives the most votes in each round moves on to the next. Since we are down to only 4 universities, the winners of this round will move into the championship next week. Sponsors are handing out prizes for voting, as well as a grand prize to the winning university. The winning university will gain access to an online design challenge. Students from this university only can submit ideas into this challenge and take a shot at winning:  * 1st) Apple Macbook Pro * 2nd) Apple iPad Air * 3rd ) GoPro Camera Please take a moment to stop in and vote for your school and take a shot at some great prizes.

I would really appreciate it if you can spare 20-30 minutes of your time to complete a couple of design tasks using this system.

My work commute takes me through Purdue campus every day. I write this because I want every student to make it to class safely in the morning and I also write it because I don’t want to run you over, thus increasing my insurance premium... During rush hour in the evening and especially the morning, please pay attention to the street signs. When turning I’ve almost hit students numerous times when they’ve not heeded the don’t walk sign.  This is compounded by the fact that in some cases while turning I have to prevent myself from being tboned because I have a caution turn light. But when I have that light, the students get the do not walk light... yet they walk out anyway. Again, I want everyone to be safe so please just pay attention to those signs, especially when it’s dark during the morning and as it slowly gets darker in the evening. That intersection is hella busy during rush hour and people are trying to get home to their families safely as well. So please be polite to those of us who have cars.

As a dumbass college student, I thought I was crossing before it was my right to do so, but that walking sign was right opposite me, blinking and counting down.

I\\'ll be at Purdue University over the summer (doing a high school summer thing...no, it\\'s not one of those expensive for-credit things, lol).

IE 335 (I think that's the right number) doesn't seem very interesting, but seems fairly easy. It requires me to get an override, though, which is obnoxious.

I lost my keys in Smith Hall earlier this morning, sometime between 11 am and 12:30 pm. I believe I left them in the women\\'s restroom on the first floor, or dropped them somewhere along the way on my trek from there to Smith 118 just around the corner.

If anyone has found them please message me on here so I can arrange to grab them from you, or let me know where I can pick them up! There is a reward for their return, as understandably I really would like to not have to pay to get every single one of my keys remade.

To be precise, I have no idea what I am doing wrong and it is mostly from not knowing what is expected of me in the assignments (ex, I got counted down because my font was the wrong color.

The following are my own thoughts after being in the program during the '13-'14 year. FYE is pretty much a tool used by the university to demoralize new engineering students to the point where anybody who isn't serious enough about becoming an engineer will drop or fail out of the program. I'm not trying to tell you to give up or be discouraged, but be aware that your FYE courses shouldn't be taken lightly. Purdue is a great university, especially when it comes to engineering, so be prepared to be challenged as some of the world's brightest students. A few rules you should follow: be sure to create a balance between your education, health, and social life, as hanging out with friends and getting exercise are important supplements to, but should not replace, valuable study time. Attend (and be sober for) every lecture, lab, and recitation. Go to office hours, start assignments early, be serious about your team projects, and above all, get 'enough' sleep. I failed to follow most of these rules during my first semester, making my freshman year both stressful for me and unimpressive for internship resumes. Again, I'm really not trying to discourage you. Even when college gets tough, keep in mind that you were accepted into Purdue's engineering program because they know you are capable of succeeding here. If you find yourself struggling, there are many on-campus resources for you to take advantage of, whether you're struggling with a single class, time management, or some deeper personal issue. Just remember, your college experience depends completely on what priorities and decisions you make. Good luck! <eos> \", \"<bos> I want to take a class that I don't have the prereqs for.

I applied Regular Decision as a Web Programming and Design major.

One person from this subreddit actually previously PM\\'ed me saying that he got accepted into UC Berkeley for Computer Science but denied from Purdue. He did get into his alternate major at the Polytechnic school in Purdue though, and he is currently a Boilermaker. The fact that he got accepted by Berkeley but denied by Purdue for Computer Science gave me a wake-up call and made me realize that applying to Purdue as a Computer Science major would be crap-shoot.

We are all on individual leases with our landlord. Since they've moved in, they've been an absolute nightmare. They've caused flooding multiple times by not using shower curtains and getting water all over the floor, as well as smoked in the house despite repeated warnings from both me and the management. I tried being nice and civil, and I even told them it was OK to smoke pot and hookah in the house because I'm not an asshole, I just can't deal with cigarette smoke. In our leases it clearly states that smoking is only allowed if every member of the house agrees to it. They are in clear violation of the lease we signed, yet the property managers seem pretty indifferent about it. Is there any sort of legal recourse I can fall back on to get my management to start evicting them? The impression I got is that they really don't give a shit because they're going to make a boatload of money off of the 4 of them (and the associated damages) regardless.  <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm an international student who's trying to decide between colleges.

However, I scored a 71% on ALEKS which is 4% below the requirement to get into calculus. That means I would have to take MA158 and it does not count towards CODO GPA calculation and is a zero credit course for CS which IMO is a complete waste of time. I took the computer science course at my high school which was miserable and I did not learn anything. It was taught by the business teacher who was not even sure how to operate a computer so essentially, that was a waste of time, but an easy A. That being said, I feel like I would have to take CS177 because although I know a few things about programming, I consider myself a complete beginner, but this course also is a zero credit course for CS which IMO is also a waste of time and money. So what should I do? I can take the ALEKS assessment four more times and I know that I can get that 75% to get in calculus, but if I do that I feel like I would be setting myself up for failure and not be able to handle the course.

My dorm's (Hawkins) officers strictly told me that my PUID was required for me to check in, which means I won't be able to get in my room until Monday, 24th.

Currently, I am a junior in College of Health and Human Sciences. My advisor DIDN'T tell me that I could graduate a semester early...I really don't like her. I signed a year long lease for my apartment. I REALIZED that I REALLY SCREWED...I could have done get a single room in hawkins do don't have to deal with sublease and whatnot. Since I signed the lease after fall break, so there is no way I could back up from my lease. And right now, I am seeing a lot of people posting sublease on facebook.

The \"benefits\" they talk about when it comes to insurance is marginal at best, and I don\\'t care about their magazine at all. However, I\\'m more interested in the networking aspect of membership.

I'm currently in HTM 372: *World Tourism Geography*, and one of our projects is conducting an in-depth interview with an international student or faculty member to learn about their home country. While this sounds simple enough, there is one major restriction in that they cannot be Chinese, Korean, or Indian. No one I currently know passes this restriction, so I can't interview any of the friends I've met so far on campus.

I\\'m an international student (Indian) and I applied to Purdue with the prospective major of Computer Science. Initially, I got the \"Denied/Offered Alternative Major\" decision and I decided to reapply with alternative majors. This time I ended up getting in, but with the Computer and Information Technology major. My question is, is it going to be at all viable to think about going there and switching majors? In my original email (the Denied/Offered Alternative Major one) this was written: You will have the opportunity to identify up to three alternative majors and should select them in priority order. Only choose majors in which you are truly interested. If you are admitted, we cannot guarantee you would be able to switch from the alternative major into the major you originally requested on your application. Typically, majors that are in very high demand at the admission stage also have limited capacity for enrolled students seeking to switch. So I get the feeling that it\\'d be very very difficult to switch majors, but I really don\\'t know if it\\'s a gamble worth taking so I\\'m hoping I could get some insight here. It\\'s worth nothing at this point that if I\\'m understanding this correctly, IT is at the Polytechnic Institute but CS is at the \"main\" Purdue campus? I don\\'t really 100% know what the distinction is but I think it\\'s worth mentioning. At the end of the day I really don\\'t want to study IT...probably bad form to mention this in this subreddit, but I also got an acceptance for CS in SUNY Buffalo. I know that the hard fact is that Purdue\\'s more reputed than Buffalo, but honestly I want to learn about the CS side of things, I looked up the courses and it\\'s like, I won\\'t even do a bit of programming until sophomore year?

Definitely extroverted, I have a lot of connections, but most are freshmen. I have a bit of a question about fraternity parties and outside parties on campus. It seem to me so far that the greek life is very disconnected from the rest of campus, and most every party they host is closed off to people not either in their fraternity or from an invited sorority. That leads to my question, does this open up as the year goes on and the pledges are all set in, or are will I just have to pledge a fraternity if I want to find anything to do on campus.

This kind of question has been asked here before but I just wanted more details. I have just completed my Sophomore year. I don't really know anyone at Purdue even after two years living in the dorms. My time here only consists of doing homework/studying and playing video games. The advice people give is that you just have to interact with people on your floor/classroom or just join some groups but I feel it is not that simple. I have tried the first one. I have made small talk with some people on my floor. But that is about how far it goes. They all seem to have other friends to hang out with or are not really interested. As for clubs/groups I have not joined any but I fear the same situation will occur. I don't really have any true interests(all I do is play PC games and I'm not even good) I don't think I am that socially awkward(I think). I work alright in class discussions and group work. But everyone to me is just an acquaintance. I don't really want to spend the next years doing the same thing as I am starting to get sick of it.

It is being constantly updated to reflect on the status of the work being done on the issue. [Here's the link]([url link] And here is the text on the topic: *Thanks to everyone who has signed up and installed Office 365 Education for Students. We are excited to see the response and we are monitoring feedback to make sure students have a great experience.* *If you are not able to activate your Office 365 installation, please try activating again in 10 minutes using the same email address and password. If you are still experiencing an activation issue, please post your question below.* *Status Update 23-Sept 08:11 UTC -8: Unfortunately due to an unforeseen issue some students have run into a delay activating the Office ProPlus clients after download. We have investigated the issue and are currently finalizing an update to the service. In the meantime, to ensure students have a great experience we will disable new students signing up for the offer for a few hours while we deploy the update. New students regardless of eligibility will see the following message: “Sorry, your school isn’t on our list of eligible institutions. We’ll check to make sure the list is up to date, so try again in a few days…”* *Users who have installed Office on Windows have a 5-day grace period in which all features and functionality are available. After installing Office, affected Windows users can close the activation sign-in page to continue using Office until we resolve the problem. We’re sorry, but there is no workaround for Mac/iPad users.*   *We are working to update the service as soon as possible. Once the service is updated, new students will be able to sign-up and students who already installed Office (on Windows, Mac, and iPad) will be able to activate successfully.*  <eos> \", '<bos> Former Boilermaker here. I just got expelled for hacking into another student\\'s computer and placing child pornography on it, among other related crimes. The fun part? PUPD investigated the issue and found no connection to me.  An anonymous report was received stating that this student had illegal images on his computer. I was then accused of hacking into his computer and putting them there (\"it isn\\'t mine, I swear!\"). The Office of Institutional Equity decided to investigate. I was given no information about the crimes I was accused of. I responded, denying any involvement, and indicated various technological limitations that make it implausible for me to have done this. Despite this, the OIE determined that I was guilty. I was never presented with any evidence, nor was anyone able to explain how I could have committed these crimes. Only after the conclusion of the investigation was I able to see the report that the OIE compiled. According to the documents, neither PUPD nor the OIE had found any evidence linking me to these events. Instead, they reasoned that it was still \"more likely than not\" me (I\\'m a big, scary computer major). It was also found that the anonymous report had come from the other student\\'s IP address (The implications of this were either not understood or ignored). Every detail of this case makes me feel outraged. This isn\\'t Watch\\\\_Dogs, I can\\'t just press X to hack into things. It\\'s also incredibly arrogant that the university would blatantly disregard the lack of findings from the police department. PUPD employs trained professionals in criminal justice, has decades of experience, and has access to many experts and resources. But what do _they_ know, right? What\\'s most insulting is that if anyone anywhere else was found with illegal images on their computer, and they claimed someone hacked into it and put them there, they would be laughed at. This same student had also previously made false accusations against me of unwanted sexual conduct (we have had issues with each other in the past), and spent a large portion of his freshman year trying to get his roommate kicked out of housing. Why would they listen to _him_? So here I sit, writing this message, not in a jail cell, without any criminal charges against me, expelled from a university for gross crimes I haven\\'t committed.

I will be attending Purdue this fall as a freshman (FYE) with the intention of becoming a mechanical engineer.

Do your shoes get really dirty walking around campus during winter months.  2) On the housing website, it is said that to have your bed elevated costs an additional amount, but I have seen other forums in which students have said that Purdue employees can do it for free. Which one is true? 3) I have heard that making high grades is hard at Purdue because grades are not inflated. I see myself as a relatively smart and hardworking student, so would maintaining a 3.7 or 3.8 GPA in Mechanical Engineering be extremely difficult? 4) I am interested in the BSME/MSME program. How hard is it to get into the program, and how hard is it to complete the fifth year (graduate degree).  5) How good are the Purdue dining courts? Is there one that is particularly better than the others?

I signed up for two languages because I can't get started on my major without a certain class, and I really enjoy learning languages. However, I couldn't find any specific information about these classes, and I'm a bit worried about taking two languages at once... Does anyone on here have experience with these classes, or the FR and ITAL departments? I'm not sure if there are multiple FR 301 professors, but if there are, which ones would you recommend? What's the workload like? Quizzes/exams? For FR 301, is most of the class based on gaining speaking, listening, and reading comprehension skills, or does grammar make up a significant chunk? Is getting an A in language courses manageable? Thanks so much! I appreciate all and any advice :) <eos> \", '<bos> Just wondering how long do most non urgent requests take to fix?

Now it's time to do something about it.  I recently got accepted to graduate school here and I'll start this summer, after I graduate in May. I 100% plan on starting a motorcycle club at that point. In order to get the gears moving I'm thinking about two or three group rides this semester now that it's warming up outside.  I'll be bringing my FJR 1300 (silver) back to campus after spring break. That Saturday (24th) it should be in the low 50s, according to the almanac. Of course weather permitting, I'm thinking a Saturday afternoon ride. There's a nice easy twisty road west of campus and we can ride to Chauncey and get something to eat too.  Who's interested?

I'm taking Spanish because it's required for my degree, but I'm actually enjoying the class a lot more than I ever did in high school and I seem to be doing pretty good so far!

I know this seems like I can’t do well in the class, but it’s just that I did not study because of a rough year with family problems and stuff. I am confident I can get atleast an A- if I take it again, but I just realized that dropping the class is actually counted as one attempt. Is there a way I can retake this course. This course is important to me so if not, I’d be willing to take this course else where, like in a community college and transfer the credits for the course if that’s a viable option.

I get signed up for my classes and I'm taking CGT 10101 and CGT 11800 (foundations of computer graphics technology, and foundations of imaging technology.)

I am not an artist not a bit and I'm freaking out! Don't get me wrong I figured there would be some sketching or designing going into this major, but this seems like a lot more sketching.

Using the costs on the housing rates page a 3 bedroom apt. is $4608 a year for the room and $9216 for a room and meal plan. $4608 for the meal plan alone, subtract $450 for the dining dollars, and you're left with about $16.90 * 246 meals for the year. I emailed the director of dining services who confirmed that this cost is the highest among the meal plans because you're allowed to swipe for other people and carry meals over from week to week, etc... but this is such a terrible deal I can't think of any reason whatsoever you'd want to use this instead of paying the GUEST PRICE for meals which is around $11 for students. <eos> \", \"<bos> We were thinking of starting a 3D Printing Club here at Purdue but wanted to first know if any of you guys would actually be interested in learning how to run a 3D printer and/or print any of your ideas/prototypes/designs.

They should have known that placing Andy Gross after a talk about sexual assault would not go over well with the audience. The University should be ashamed to field such a disaster.

Problem is I don't really know/seem to change my mind every other week. I haven't had an internship or anything, so without any industry experience and only a few classes under my belt it's hard to make a guess at what interests me.  I've made a list of the upper div classes that interest me and based on that I've thought about software engr, systems programming, security,  DBIS (DBIS and soft engr a little less than the other two but still enough I've considered them, p much all other tracks are uninteresting to me). Upperclassmen, what made you decide to pursue a certain track and how did you end up feeling about it? I've heard that tracks really don't make a huge difference to recruiters and what matters is just the classes you've taken and how you've applied yourself in/outside them based on your interests. I'm the kind of person who always needs to have a plan tho, so I'm trying to narrow it down now even if I change my mind later :p I also have the scheduling flexibility and the motivation (for now) to specialize in more than one area, and excluding DBIS I know there's a lot of overlap in the ones I've listed which seems to make it viable but by all means correct me if I'm wrong :p just wondering about perspective from people who've been around the block with upper div CS classes.

I'm going to be staying in Cary SW, and as such, my room is a small double. My roommate and I recently learned that we can loft our beds so instead of having the standard Cary small double bunk bed layout, we could have separate beds with more room underneath. I was wondering if anybody out here has used this setup before in the Cary small double rooms, and if they could give me their opinions on this particular layout as opposed to the standard layout. We're kind of worried that the low ceiling (8') and extremely narrow room (we calculated that with two lofted beds there would be 2.3' in between the beds) might impact the actual usable area of the room somewhat, but if anyone has experience with this setup, I would be grateful if you could share your impressions.

Another option that I'm thinking of is to use one of those Purdue payment plans where I would put maybe 10-12k down initially and then pay a couple thousand every few months through the semester since the interest is negligible.

Do not take up the entire area, people are trying to get some where. Move to the wall or go to an area where it is larger and less people are actively walking in that area.

Unfortunately, as a 1st gen student I've had almost no exposure to this type of thing at home (parents don't have jobs requiring this kind of attire, so they're not able to help much with this), and so I need some advice:  Where would you recommend I go to get business/professional type clothes (for things like interviews, networking events) for a decent price?

One of the options I'm contemplating is getting a second degree in CS to have the added security later on.

I was wondering about some professors since many do not have any reviews on them on ratemyprofessor or other sites. For ECE 302 I have the option for Stanley H Chan, Chih-Chun Wang, and Gelfand. I'm going to take Chan because I had Wang and while a good teacher, I failed his class hard because he focuses so much on the math. As for Gelfand I have heard he is horrible.

In fact I'd be quite uncomfortable sharing, so which are the halls that have single occupancy rooms and which would you wise ol' redditors recommend? - I like to smoke a fair amount of herb, what is the security like around campus and are they particularly harsh if you're caught? -What is the university ethos as a whole, is it all about academic excellence or is there time to actually do stuff as well?

This comes in very handy (especially the first week of the semester) to add a course that was previously full but someone has dropped, or to switch to a more desirable section that may have been previously full. This program has helped me on about 4 occasions while still at Purdue and I have several friends which it has helped as well; I'm just sharing so that more people can get use out of it now since most that knew about this have likely graduated and moved on or don't frequent this sub anymore.

Come join the Boiler League of Tag for this semester's edition of Humans versus Zombies! **Game Week is the the week of April 2.** HvZ is a week long, campus wide game of tag that simulates the zombie apocalypse that we all know is coming. Players separate into two groups, the Humans, and the Zombies. Zombies attempt to tag humans to turn them into zombies, while humans defend themselves with Nerf blasters and socks in attempt to survive the week.  HvZ is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had on Purdue's campus.

I had a few questions, and it would be amazing if you guys could help me out. 1. I was looking to lease a car/buy a 2nd hand car. Are there any reliable dealers around West Lafayette? 2. If I have a car, should I look for apartments closer to campus? I was reading that free parking is only available if I live a certain distance from campus. If so, how far from campus should I find an apartment. 3. As I am an international student, I would prefer having a furnished or semi-furnished apartment.

My only real concern is my academics and the time commitment. I know that they say \"you\\'ll just work on your time management skills\", but the position I\\'m in now is already a 25 hr/week commitment so I\\'ve had a lot of that already. It will be slightly less time consuming next year, but I\\'m positive that it would take away from pledging. Which brings me to my questions: 1. Are fraternities flexible with pledge activity attendance? 2. Are brothers ever actually concerned about my academic performance, or do they just say that during rush? 3. If schoolwork becomes too much, will I just get dropped? If you don\\'t want to post anything in the public/start a flame war, please PM me.

I don't even lose my credit card or debit card, but this cheap piece of plastic somehow keep slipping out whether it's from my hand or my pocket or even the little card holder I got for my phone after losing it the second time. I'm really peeved because the first time, it wasn't that long of a walk but when I retraced my steps the card was already gone, probably because someone picked it up even though I immediately went back to check. I waited 3 days before giving up and getting a new one because I was wasting money on food rather than just using my meal swipes and the inconvience was painful. Second time I lost it I just bought a new one immediately because I feel like the wait is not worth it. I waste more money waiting for my card back because of the potentially wasted meal swipes, and there's no guarantee when I get my card back. The third time- which I didn't even think was possible because I was always making sure I had it but I look away one second and it's gone all of a sudden.... I retraced my steps and I couldn't find it. So either I dropped it on the bus or someone picked it up... I know they're doing a good deed and there isn't a good way to tell how long a card has been dropped but it's really annoying when I could have just dropped it, realised a minute after, went back but it's already gone.

            "GENERATED COMMENTS: Hey, so I survived my first semester at Purdue, now I'm wondering about next semester and textbooks.  * 1) Should I email the professor and ask if we're actually going to use the textbook recommended on MyPurdue?(Or would that be rude) * 2) How long should I wait before stalking Amazon for the best prices on my textbooks, because I know I'm going to need at least one? * 3)Should I wait till school starts and then risk not having textbooks for the first few weeks? I'm taking SPAN201, WGSS280, PSY201, PSY367, and PSY272    I would definitely advise against going to Amazon before class starts. They just get so expensive because they are super hard. The only downside for the professors is they have a hard time finding the textbook, so your best bet is going to be just to walk across the street from the book shop and ask them if it is available.   That's probably my best advice\n",
            "Reference COMMENTS: I usually wait till the first week of school to find out if I really need the books for my classes. Plus you might end up dropping/switching classes as well. Why pay when you can just get pdf's online? Other than access codes ig SPAN 201 and 202 both required the textbook, because they used an online homework system that required a code (Fall 2016-Spring 2017). I took span 201 this semester, and you definitely need to buy the book. We used it almost every day in class. My professor wouldn’t let us use the E-book in class, but if yours does then you don’t need the physical book.  \n"
