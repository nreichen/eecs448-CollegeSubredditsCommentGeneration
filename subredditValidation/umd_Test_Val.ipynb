The teachers I have are all pretty good and the classes individually are not too bad. But I just want some opinions or if anyone has experience with a similar schedule. Also any info about any of the instructors would be much appreciated to.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Got an email about being a community assistant, and I’m pretty interested. But should I apply as a freshman? Is working a job on top of adjusting to college too much? I also plan to explore clubs and want to meet new people, I don’t know if 10 hours a week is considered a big time commitment or not. How long is a shift and what do you do? What are the late night shifts like?  The reason I want to work this job is because I heard there’s not much work, so I can do homework or watch Netflix most of the time. Are there any other on campus jobs that are similar in this regard?  Also, how much earlier do CAs have to move in? What do you do during those days?  Lastly, how likely is it that I’ll get this job? I’m assuming since they sent an email out about it they’re still hiring. Are there other freshmen working as CAs?  Thanks for all your help guys <eos> \n",

I'm actually not worried about getting tickets (they wouldn't be able to charge a student account), more worried about getting towed, or even booted. Library: Can anyone just walk in and utilize the collection of freely available books and periodicals? Would I need to swipe an ID badge to have access to the library? Of course, I wouldn't be able to check out books or use the computers, but it would be cool to just find a quiet spot and read books. Events: Are there any speakers whose presentations I can attend or special seminars? I'm only here for the summer, and living at my house in CP is getting pretty boring, since I don't know anyone here. I just want to utilize this giant university that's like a mile away from me. It's also vastly more beautiful of a campus than my own school. And I know it doesn't sound like it from what I said above, but I am quite the party animal. What's the scene like at UMD?  <eos> \n",

I really don't know what the f*** to do.... I heard the CompSci curriculum is tough so idk if I should major in something easier or is it worth it to double major in something like I named above. Any info would be greatly appreciated as I have to schedule my classes!! Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've seen a lot of people frustrated talking about the current situation for CS students in petitions such as: [url link] or talking about having marches to raise awareness, etc. Now while I think these things can be helpful if done tastefully and respectfully, but I have yet to hear anyone ask the obvious question: \"How can we just get more resources to better help the situation?\" Good question! If you are a Maryland resident like so many of us are, you can reach out to your local and state representatives to try and help out. Many of them are on committees that are in charge of things such as getting funding for the university. If enough people express interest they have to listen as we vote them into office. Here is a list of state representatives by district with their contact information: [url link] If you are unsure what district you are in here is a helpful site that will tell you who your representatives are: [url link] I might personally recommend calling the offices over emailing them as old fashioned as that sounds because they get bombarded by emails sometimes but political offices usually have to record how many phone calls they get about a given issue per day. Please share the petition with them so they understand the situation and let's see if we can get some help to change the situation! <eos> \n",

They said on the PT they may test again on the first day of class (to see if you truly belong there?) and I am wondering whether I should study for it or if it was just a scare tactic to prevent cheating. I really am bummed I wasn't placed in Calc, but I also don't want to mess up on a potential additional test and be put even lower math class. Please let me know if you have any insight! <eos> \n",

Testudo says there are 3 remaining seats, and I'm #2 on the holdfile waitlist. Does that mean i'm guaranteed a seat?  Thanks! Good luck to everyone this semester :) <eos> \n",

Everyone is saying he's funny and engaging and stuff, but just how big is the workload? Specifically, is it like 2-4 hours of reading for each class? Is he really that harsh of a grader?  This is a gen ed so I don't want to dump 10+ hours every week into it. I can handle a couple of busier weeks here and there though <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So CMSC131 this year has been incredibly frustrating. I’m taking it with Golub, who I unfortunately found out is completely useless. The first test I got a 92 on. The second a 64. I discussed with Golub on how to improve and took matters into my own hands. For the third test I studied like crazy. I reviewed the projects, labs, and quizzes. I studied from two different textbooks. And I got a freaking 56. I’m physically and mentally drained. I don’t know what to do. What the hell is this?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I think I am in a rare situation here and I am quite anxious now. I am just wondering that has anyone had experiences with filing for exceptions to policy for summer session courses? (I am a CS major.) I filed for withdrawal last Friday for two classes I registered for summer session. One of the class finished last Friday, and the other one is still going. The reason for my petition is more of difficulties I encountered in both classes. The TA time for both classes mostly conflicted with my schedule, or sometimes there are simply too many students asking questions, thus I had a hard time having my problems solved before assignments or exams due. I have specified this in the letter of justification, however beyond that I didn't attach any other documents. The petition form seems to imply that without any supplement documents it will result in automatic denial, but I am not sure it's still the same case with summer session course--since it's not mandatory to register for summer session courses. I hope someone who had been through similar situation can share their experiences to help ease my anxiety. Thanks. <eos> \n",

But when I checked the next day (Feb. 7th) I was registered. I have called the Office of Registrar and they keep bouncing me from person to person and I'm currently waiting for this last person to get back to me. Has anyone had a similar experience? All I'm asking for at this point is even a partial refund.  <eos> \n",

Come and hang out with us at our two non-career-fair events! We can tell you about Microsoft internships and full time jobs, how awesome Seattle summers are (and how it reacted to getting 6 inches of snow last winter), which 400-levels to take, whatever you'd like. You can even talk to me about why my top Reddit submission is just trying to get karma by reposting John Oliver. -------------- **What**: Microsoft Office Hours **When**: 9/19 11am to 2pm tomorrow! **Where**: AVW 4424 --------- **What**: Meet Microsoft **When**: 9/20 6pm to 8pm **Where**: ESJ 1224 ----------  (The last four times I was here, students requested that I post messages like this because they didn't know when Microsoft/other company events were) This year is a little different from previous years with the career fair being before our other events, but if you want to skip the line, you can bring your resume to one of the other events. Trust me, you do not want to wait in that line, save yourself the time :). -/u/_j_ <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm trying to pick upper levels based on what will be the most useful in my career later on but the problem is they're all reportedly difficult and I'm also double majoring in another time intensive major so I can't overload. So far I've taken data structures 420, computer architecture 411, game design 425, and computer graphics 427.  The classes and professors I'm thinking of so far are Thomas Gilray for compilers, Neil Spring for operating systems, and David Mount for algorithms (those are all difficult classes so I only intend on taking one of them + some other not as difficult class). Does anyone have any recommendations for classes I should take if I'm trying to go for computer graphics or classes that are helpful in general? Is it worth it for me to take a throwaway class just to balance my schedule?  <eos> \n",

I just want an easy stat class so I don't have to worry about retaking it and don't want to be suffering throughout the semester. (The other options are EDMS451 or BMGT230) <eos> \n",

The next one I'll plan will definitely be on a Friday. If anyone has ideas for new places to go for meetups, please suggest them, or alternatively organize your own but remember that the chosen location has to accommodate enough people. A picnic was mentioned for the Spring, which I think is a great idea. Also please suggest the best time for a Friday meetup. I feel like 5:30 for today might have been a little too early and I apologize if you couldn't make it because of that. <eos> \n",

But it also says I was recommended for admission to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and that he has final say. So what are the chanes of not being accepted? If it's still not finalized/it's still up in the air then I'm kinda annoyed because other programs sent out their letters weeks ago and I need to really figure out what I'm doing next year. Plus UMD had the earliest application deadline of all the program I applied to yet they're taking the longest. It's my top choice and I really just want to know!!  If anyone is interested, the exact wording:  Your application has been evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the Graduate Program in --- Science. I am pleased to inform you that the committee is recommending you an admission to our --- Science M.S. program for the Fall 2015 semester.  Please note that the final decision regarding admission comes from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and you will be hearing from him soon.  Dr. --- will serve as your academic advisor. Please email us of your acceptance to the program at your earliest convenience. You should receive a separate admission letter from the University of Maryland Graduate School within a couple of weeks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have recently visited the campus and was shocked to see how badly things have gotten over the last few years since I attended school here. Fraternities can't get their shit together with hazing. Students are unable to cross the fucking road without getting hit by a car. And the party scene has been degenerated to few satellites barely keeping it together. You have let the campus police and administration overrun the school. You call that a fucking party school? You know, I used to be proud to be a Terp. Now it seems that every semester, you act like children, get in trouble, and ruin the reputation of what used to be an outstanding institution of higher learning and black outs. <eos> \n",

Which means to get my car charged back up I would have to charge at one spot for 2 hours and then move my car to another spot to charge for another hour and then move my car again to somewhere I can park hopefully for free. This makes the cost to commute more than a gas car.. Does anyone know of any free (or cheap) charging stations (or even a wall outlet) that is walking distance to the campus? <eos> \n",

I'm shooting for a dual degree EE/CS so my schedule doesn't have too much leeway to waste credits.

If you've taken it, what science classes do you recommend taking before taking the DAT? Did you use Kaplan or DAT Destroyer? How many weeks did you study leading up to the exam?  Any advice or information about your experience is much appreciated! :)  A bit more about me: My strongest section is organic and my weakest is either general (haven't taken gen chem ii yet) or bio. By the end of the spring semester I will have taken BSCI 160/170/207/222 and CHEM 131/231/241/271. I plan on hibernating next semester to study and I'll be applying to DDS/PhD programs the following fall. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm taking CMSC 422 with William Regli this semester and I'm so frustrated that I figured I'd ward other people away from it if he teaches in future semesters. Regli is a really cool guy. He was the head of DARPA for 3 years, and taught at Drexel for a while. So he really knows his stuff. But that's about all the good I can say about him.  His classes are mostly him teaching really hard concepts, but taking little time to explain the portions that are tough. He has these slides that are jammed packed with information, but he'll click to the next one like every 30 seconds. So there's no way you can take notes. And even if you are just paying attention, it might not be enough because he just glosses over the hard to explain topics. And then the projects. Oh lord those projects. They shouldn't be too tough. He gives a fair amount of skeleton code, and it's mostly just you filling in the rest here and there. Sounds easy, but he manages to ruin it.  The instructions for the projects are very unclear. He will give methods with parameters that he just doesn't explain. So now you have this X variable, but you've got no clue what it represents. In addition, he says to implement some pretty hard algorithms. This is fair for a comp Sci class, except he barely ever goes in depth about how to implement them anywhere in the slides. So it's up to you to figure out this difficult algorithm and just hope you can find how to do it on the internet.  Then there's Piazza. Obviously everyone has tons of questions because his project questions make no sense. But no one answers any of the questions. This could be attributed to not enough TAs having time to look at Piazza. But when it's the day before a project is due, and there are 7 unanswered questions just from that day, it becomes very frustrating.  His entire projects kind of turn into Googling fests since you can't rely on his slides, nor Piazza. And this is sometimes fine. But sometimes you just can't figure out your question on Google. So I've had times where I was just stuck in a project and had no way of getting any form of answer. If you're still reading, then you can obviously tell I'm very frustrated. And I am. But that's why I'm making this post. If you are considering taking Machine Learning, because to be honest Machine Learning is awesome, just take it a different semester with a different teacher.  <eos> \n",

Girlfriend is trying to rent out her room, since we are moving into an apartment together. Roommates keep to themselves, but. Nestled right next to Greenbelt Park, this apartment has plenty of nature trails and next to zero traffic noise at night. Also a quick walk away from a UMD Shuttle stop.

Some of the projects/homeworks for 150 and 131 would be really useful, and an idea on what p161 is like too. I know I'm going to see it in a month, but I like dipping my feet in what I'm getting into ahead of time. Is there a math test bank equivalent for these classes, or can someone hook me up with some old course content? Any insight/advice would be great too  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am a senior at Huntingtown High School which is in the the Southern Maryland area. I am applying by the November 1st early action deadline and am aiming to major in computer science. I would appreciate input from anyone who has been accepted to UMD on whether or not I have a good chance of being accepted. Throughout high school I have taken a pretty rigorous course load, including Calculus BC this year. My weighted GPA is currently at about a 3.9 and my cumulative is at about 3.7. Since I would like to major in computer science, I have taken several computer science courses, 2 of which being AP. My SAT scores are mediocre, given that my reading/ writing score weighs it down a bit. Super score- 1270 Math- 700 Reading- 570 I have been a member of my schools marching band throughout high school, earning awards such as varsity, Drumline section leader, and drum technician. I have also been a member of about 3 clubs throughout high school. I also have had a job for the last 2 years. I plan to get 1 letter of recommendation from my guidance counselor, and 3 from teachers, including my math, computer science, and band teachers. I would appreciate input from anyone currently attending UMD. Thanks   <eos> \n",

I will only be taking those 2 classes this summer, with no internships or part time jobs outside of them. Anyone wanna provide extra tips, or reassurance from those of you who have passed these two classes over the summer before? Also, does anyone else who is about to do this want to form a groupme/discord for studying? I get that groupme is usually used but I figured discord would be nice for the voice chatting. <eos> \n",

I got an email last Friday saying I was ineligible to take the course since I didn't take Math 141 and to contact the office for more information.

We each got into pretty much random groups and did a little activity. The prof. eventually made us create a group name. My question is are these groups from orientation gonna coincide with some sort of group we’ll have when first semester starts. Also can anyone tell me how sts is like, is there a main project we focus on like people in Gemstone, if so can anyone give me any tips. Thanks  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello everyone. I am required to take a upper-level statistics course which is a requirement for the journalism major. I am trying to take an easier statistics course because mathematics is not one of my best subject areas. I also have a learning disability which has an effect on math. I heard that many of the journalism majors are taking EDMS 451. I am not comfortable in taking the course due to the given factors I had mentioned. I am interested in taking SOCY201, but I am on the waiting list from the Sociology department and they give preference to those in department and then to non-sociology majors. So the chances are 50:50. Does anyone any statistics courses that would be right for me to take based on my circumstances ? Thank you. <eos> \n",

I got a D in a non-major class freshman year, which really hurt my GPA. I *do* need to put my GPA on my resume, right?

Of the classes that I attended save the ones I was sick for, the teacher only briefly went over the readings we had to have the night before and then continues to rant about his liberal views on society for a good 40 minutes. 2.)

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm having some trouble with my schedule. Problem 1: I just found out I got a 5 on Calc BC and the AB subscore. I am currently scheduled for math141, because I was not sure at the time what my AP score was. What is the next logical math class for me to take? I would think it is Calc 3, since that is a continuation of what I've been doing. But when I go to the testudo website, it says calc3 is Math241, and has a prerequisite of Math241. I assume it's a typo as a class can't be it's own prerequisite, but I'm not sure if they meant Math240 instead, in which case I'd have to take linear algebra before calc 3 which doesn't make much sense to me.  Problem 2: I'm coming in to college as a freshman with 28 credits. I'm glad I have them, but it's making scheduling a bit of a pain. I definitely want to go all 4 years and I'm dead set on a computer science major, so this leaves me with only having to take, on average, 11.5 credits a semester to graduate with 120 credits. Problem is, my scholarship requires full-time student status (12 credits a semester) and I'm going to have to pay extra money for credit filler classes. This isn't a big deal as this totals to one or two classes, but I feel like it's weird to only take 12 credits a semester every semester for all of college. Any insight to either of these problems is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance guys. EDIT: Oh, and also, does anybody know if classes are still opening up and they're just keeping some closed for future orientations? Because a few of the classes I want are completely full, which seems odd in early july. Thanks again. <eos> \n",

I know it's only a 1-credit class that meets once a week for an hour, but I'm totally new to the concept of an honors seminar so I would like some feedback. Another thing is, I'm already registered for 18 credits so if I were to add it this sem it would need to be the kind of class that is very easy to pass with little/no time commitment.

Other (probably more effective options) include the [Housing Facebook group]([url link] Also check out the [Off Campus Housing Guide]([url link] linked in the sidebar. *** *FAQ* **What are my options for summer housing and beyond?** Well for the summer you will have options to sublease in Commons/Courtyards, the View and Varsity, CP Towers, or another off campus housing option. Each of these will have different prices and amenities so you should look at their websites. Check out [Off Campus Housing Services]([url link] for more info. <eos> \n",

It's a great way for students, especially underclassmen, to find ways to get involved and learn what this university has to offer. Here on /r/UMD, we host our own little virtual version of the First Look Fair. Feel free to promote groups that you are involved in. Be sure to give name and description of the group and add links to Facebook, Twitter, group emails, or ways to sign up. Just some advice to all the underclassmen: if you're interested in something, try it out. You might find out it's not your thing and never show up again but you might also meet some really cool people that share a similar interest and turn a hobby into a passion. There's over 800 active student groups so there's something for everyone and if you can't find exactly what you are looking for, you can even create your own group! *** *Additional Resources* * [First Look Fair 2015: Reddit Edition]([url link] * [OrgSync]([url link] - Browse student groups online Fun note: For the last FLF:RE exactly a year ago, I mentioned we almost hit 5,000 subscribers.

I also have a micro SD card (111 GB left) and an external hard drive (1 TB). What should I download Linux on?  I figure if I am going to be using Linux in the future, I might as well have a bootloader since my C drive is SSD and Linux will be much faster right? Thanks. <eos> \n",

I'm tired of receiving emails from Anne Reese Carswell about all the [NYUMBURU-UG] and Chapel Service stuff, but I can't figure out how to unsubscribe. I even tried sending a reply, although I doubt it went anywhere considering it's probably an email list that's being used. Anyways, has anyone figured out how to unsub from her? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> OK, so I just got off the waitlist for MATH461 with Yashinski, but it conflicts with my STAT400 course with Nandori.  What's making it hard to decide between these two courses is that I'm thinking about doing a math minor to go along with my CS major. However, I know that I a STAT4xx course is a requirement for my major, but now I'm not sure if I should try to take STAT400 or STAT410.  I'm not sure if I should stick with STAT400 or not since I've heard it's pretty much a joke and kind of useless and if I should even stick with the math minor or go the stat minor route because I want to do things with machine learning, data science, AI, etc. and other stuff related to those topics. TL;DR: 1. MATH461 or STAT400 next semester? (I was originally going to do a math minor but not too sure now) 2. STAT400 or STAT410? (because I want to be involved in topics such as data science and machine learning) 3. Switch from math minor to stat minor? Sorry if it's a bit hard to understand (had to type this up quickly) but I will answer any questions because I really need some help. EDIT: [Here]([url link] is the current schedule with the conflict for some visualization Ignore the gen-eds, I'm still deciding on those as well. <eos> \n",

We have been competing and training a lot over the last week, and as of now, I have some great results to share with you all! We are currently 2:0 overall, with scores of 2:0 and 2:0 in both of the BO3's we have played so far. The scores for each match were 28:0, 27:1, 12:1, and 13:2, which means they were all essentially blowouts - signifying this team has a REALLY good chance of making it far in this tournament! As of now there isn't much of a way to support the team aside from sharing your positive comments here on reddit or silently hoping we'll win during the weekends, but if we win our next 2 matches, we will have made it through the qualifiers and be guaranteed spots in the final phase of the tournament - which includes live gameplay on ESPN! I'll be providing more information on this as the tournament progresses, but just wanted to share the good news with you all. EDIT: Oops, meant to say we made it to the top 32 so far. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi! I’m looking to transfer to UMD in the next year or two and was wondering how my credentials are. I’m a political science/communications double major at Purdue University in Indiana. I’m apart of several clubs as well as being a committee leader for one and being a founding member for both of them. I also am involved in a plethora of organizing and volunteer work. Long story short I was forced to go to Purdue by my parents and am looking to transfer after realizing I was coerced to go there by them. They also stole 17k in financial aid money from me which I am currently in the process of taking legal action to get back from them. My GPA is also as low as it is (2.85) because I was coerced by my parents to major in something I did not have any interest in and I also have dealt pretty heavily with mental health issues while being in school. Sorry if I’m oversharing at all, I’m just trying to provide as much context as I can to see what my chances of getting in are and prepare myself better before applying. Any insight and advice at all will be appreciated, thank you! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I know that this semester's 351 course is different, in that we have 2 midterms and a cumulative final. I got a 44 on the first midterm and 65 on the second one.

            "<bos> I ended up with 933 points out of 1000 which gave me a 93.3 in the class. I expected to get an A, but didn't receive final exam grade for a while. Just got that grade back two days ago and got up to 933 points. I went to check the unofficial transcript which was NG up until now. It read that I got an A- in the class. I thought that automatically if you got a certain grade there was no way to bring it down, only up with a curve. Is there any way that the grade cut-off could have brought me down to an A- even though I got higher than a 93? Any previous experience would be helpful. I think I might email the teacher tomorrow asking for an explanation of how the grading system worked, but I wanted some insight now. Thanks <eos> \n",

On the math placement test, I scored where I can enroll in MATH015/115 (developmental program where I eventually get a MATH115 credit) or MATH113 (College Algebra  Trig). If I take MATH015/115 I will take MATH140 (Calc I) in the Spring, whereas if I take MATH113 I will take MATH220 (Elementary Calc I) in the Spring. Is MATH 220 looked down upon by grad schools? Personally, I would rather not take the 8am MATH015 course, but if its worth getting the better course I'm willing to make the sacrifice.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> In high school, music was an integral part of my life. I did years of jazz/chambers choir, toured Europe, was in the founding class of my school's female acapella group, sang at home games, etc. My time at CP is winding down. I think I have 3 semesters left.  I stopped singing to focus on school, because I knew it was a hobby, not a career. I have a lot going for me...I love my job and research but there's definitely a void. I miss the rush from performing and the feeling of connectedness. Anyone been in a similar situation?  <eos> \n",

Its looking like I might fail math141 and it would really suck if I \"lost\" a whole semester since I would end up being stuck having to retake 141 in the spring and thus would not be able to take cmsc 250 or 216 until the summer or fall. <eos> \n",

Hopefully if I'm admitted I won't be completely fucked on class selection (otherwise I'll see if I can defer admission)...most of my courses will likely be upper-level CS and related so I'll see how that goes. How is it being a commuter at Maryland? Do any of you commute from areas far away from campus? If I do end up going I'll have to commute for at least the first semester, after which I hope to find a place to live near UM. Presently I live with family in the Takoma Park area. Would I be missing out a lot socially and etc? I'd probably want to get involved with student organizations, which would likely be doable since I'll probably end up spending a lot of my time doing schoolwork on campus. What are transportation options like? It looks like the drive between my house and the University would be 20-40 minutes, depending on traffic. How is commuter parking...is it overly expensive, located in a shitty location, etc? And how are the UM shuttles? The closest one to me looks like it's at Silver Spring...so I could either a) take Metro or Ride-on bus to SS and take the shuttle from there (seems like a waste just to go 1 Metro stop away), or b) take Metro to College Park and take the shuttle bus from there. Or is it possible that there's a bus route that I don't know about that just happens to go through my area as well as CP? (unlikely, I know) Any advice appreciated...thanks! <eos> \n",

She's really nice but I'm afraid that it will be hard to make friends with her and in my dorm since many students will be sophomores and in the scholars program. All my friends are in Denton :(  I called reslife but they said the only thing to do was to Room Swap, which seems hard to do. Is there anything else I can do?

After the 1st class, do professors expect you to have textbooks the following class? I'm not sure if that will be doable even with something like Amazon Prime.  As a random question, do dorms provide a desk chair or do you have to bring your own?  Thanks! <eos> \n",

Chem136 isn't offered in summer but chem132 is. Obviously, these are questions for my advisor but does anyone know if I can take chem132 during summer and have it count as chem136?

We're putting together a team for CSL and ideally would like to have an average of 5k+ to be competitive in the league. Last year we got to RO8 and won $1k, so we're hoping to do better this year.

I was wondering if anyone knows the difference between the two and if I will be able to take 461 and still be able to sign up for my physics classes. Also, Math461 is completely filled, so I will be waitlisted for 461 but I can sign up for Math240 with no problem. Don't know if this changes anything. <eos> \n",

My grades for a few of my classes this semester are a bit lower than I expected, especially my computer science programming course. With my current grade, I figured it would be close to impossible to pass with a C. I'm gonna have to retake this course without a doubt, but right now what are my options? What happens if I drop it now, will it become an F on my transcript? Thanks for any insight. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I recently just finished my CMSC351 retake this summer and I was .5% away from passing the course. I was around the B range until the final came along and bombed it.  The first time around when I took the course was this spring semester. At the time I was trying to double major in both Computer Science and Information Systems. During that attempt, I dropped with a W after scoring within 1 standard deviation under the mean in hopes of getting a better grade the second time around.  I do not have any rare or extraordinary circumstances besides working.  I know there was someone recently successful with a CMSC250 appeal. Is there any advice someone could give me regarding the appeal process? Thanks. <eos> \n",

I wouldn't like finishing my studies here and thinking I missed the chance to take someone's course. What are some profs that are such big deals in their fields, or such great teachers, that you just can't afford to miss it? I'm busy with my own stuff, but I also care a lot about not being mentally trapped in a single field, so finding a few hours in my schedule to sit in a class and do some readings sounds perfectly fine with me. I'm open to literally every field you could suggest. STEM, social science, humanities... Only restrictions: not something where I'd have to *do* stuff. So no theater performance, no chemistry lab, etc. I wanna be able to just read and attend. And no languages, because that necessarily requires multiple courses. Don't worry about the level of the class. Preference given to large classes where I can easily sit in without anyone noticing, but I'm also perfectly fine asking a prof if I can sit in their small class. <eos> \n",

I've been trying my hardest to get rid of it and even though it's cheaper than current prices (shameless pitch $959 a month), no-one seems to be interested. I've tried the common housing facebook group, the och database, reddit, and advertising to friends. Are there any other new creative places that you know of that could give me more visibility?

My father was traveling and until we got word he was okay my mom was in panic mode. I remember being pulled out of school before the early close was announced. I remember the sense of community as well as the disgusting displays of islamophobia afterwards and how they seemed to contradict each other while forming simultaneously. That day changed my life, and I realize that most undergraduate students don't remember the events of 9/11, but I still feel like there should be some acknowledgment, even if it is just an email from Wallace Loh. <eos> \n",

Helps me to remember stuff better and it's cheap, simple, etc. I'm taking BMGT 301 coming up in the fall which is an information systems class. Looking over the course, there are things like \"Bring your computer to class\" days for certain objectives and such. I imagine for other classes I'll have a similar situation and it would be nice to access a personal laptop.  I'm not opposed to getting a laptop, I have a great PC at home and honestly never used anything different.  In general, is it a luxury or a necessity to bring a laptop once in 300 level classes? <eos> \n",

So how's amazon's launch day shipping, does it usually arrive on the day of release to the campus or does it usually run late. Also how's Pandora's Cube I know that is a locally run store with more of a retro focus, but does it carry new releases, and if it does is it just mainstream stuff like COD, Fallout, Madden or can I purchase more niche titles such as Tales of Zestiria or Dragon Quest Heroes to name some that are soon to be released. Note: I don't personally have a car and I don't particullary like waiting for the buses to come around so more distant options that are out of walking distance of the campus are out of question, i.e. pg county mall and Best Buy. <eos> \n",

Shortly thereafter, I got a few emails about selecting an honors program, chose EIP because business interests me, but am slowly regretting that decision. I don't want to go into either business or entrepreneurship, and it seems like that's what everyone in the program's interested in; I just wanted to do it as a hobby.  At orientation, I heard something about dropping from the program into University Honors, but I'm not sure how I would go about doing that, especially since I'll be living w/ the rest of the EIP students in La Plata. Does anyone know the timetable for something like this? Should I stick it out even if I don't really want to do anything involving entrepreneurship? I know it was foolish to not research the program I'd spend two years of my education in, but that's in the past. Any and all advice is appreciated.  <eos> \n",

I was wondering, has anyone ever heard of anyone getting special permission to take 250 and 330 together? At this point I may have to stay an extra semester if I can't re\\-take 250 over the summer. I would like to stay as on track as possible.  <eos> \n",

It will be pretty much like an Amber Alert, and it's expected to take about 30 minutes for it to have been sent to every phone. You can read more about this [here.]([url link] There's been some talk of people shutting off their phones during this period to back up the message server and potentially crash it or something. Alternatively, if you have a class during this time with a less than tech-savvy professor, record their reaction to everyone's phone going off at once (or popping up like popcorn)-- I got an Amber Alert freshman year while taking an exam with a professor who still used a flip phone, and we had to take a good five minutes to explain that we weren't all cheating with each other, but this was an involuntary notification that a child had been kidnapped nearby. His face was priceless. <eos> \n",

I am also signed up for 414 which I really don't want to take, but will have to stick with taking if I can't get into another CS class. I figure a lot of people drop classes in the first week of school, so I want to know if it's safe to drop 414 right now, hoping to get in 420, or if I should wait and attend both classes until I get into 420 or the drop period ends. Anyone know about people being waitlisted for 420 and eventually getting it? <eos> \n",

Is there anyone that has a more recent opinion to give on the place? Yelp is showing lots of negative results but I was wondering if any of these held true. Thanks.

I was told originally I will need to see my advisor first, I assume that is the same for everyone. Do I need to make an appointment with them, or do they do it for me? How early can I make an appointment? Is there anything I need to do that I haven't been told about? I know I could probably call or email umd about this stuff but I like talking to reddit instead :) <eos> \n",

I am not 100% sure as to which type of engineering I want to pursue yet, I am simply most familiar with Electrical and Computer which is why I chose those two while filling out my app. My question is: how much time would I have to decide which field of engineering I want to pursue? If I decided to go to the school, will I have Electrical related courses simply because the major on my acceptance letter says \"MAJOR: ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,\" or can I get a better understanding for other types and decide a little into my freshman year?

            "<bos> So I received residence hall linens for UMD in the mail recently and I was wondering if it's necessary to purchase everything on the list. I'm going to be a freshman so I'm not sure what's really necessary and what's not.  I'm gonna just use the Varsity Collection for reference as it has the most items:  2 flat sheets  2 fitted sheets  2 pillow cases  2 pillows  1 reversible comforter  1 quilted mattress pad  1 thermal cotton blanket  1 memory foam mattress topper  2 bath towels  2 hand towels  2 wash cloths  2 oversized bath sheets  1 fleece throw  1 pop-open hamper  2 underbed storage solutions  1 bedside buddy clip fan  1 flexible clip lamp  Practically, based on your experience, which of these items don't I need? I'll order each item separately from another store as it's probably cheaper.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am an incoming freshman for the fall of 2012 and I have one big question for you! My biggest concern about college is that I am gay and I am wondering about how i will be received. Can any of you tell me if the LGBT community is active. I am going to be quite blunt right now: I am all for being treated equally but I don't particularly care for the gay rights movement. I don't like the way they are going about it. I respect the people who do partake in it, but I don't like it myself. I also could say that I have my feminine moments like every gay guy but I am mostly not overly flamboyant. I just like video games, foreign language and the occasional man. I know that makes me sound like an asshole, but I'm just describing myself.  At any rate, if there is anyone here who can help me out with this or if there are any gay or lesbian people here than can help me out. I think I would join the LGBT club, which I saw at Maryland Day, but was too afraid to approach. Basically, my fear is that I will be victimised and whatnot for being gay. I plan to be 100% open with everyone from the get-go. I want to know also, if there is a way to tell housing that I'm gay and that I want to make sure I don't get a homophobic roommate.  Thank you all so much! I hope to see you next year! Hopefully on my actual account too!  <eos> \n",

Are we allowed to bring our own Ethernet cords and plug it into our laptops for internet? If so, is the Ethernet any faster than the wifi? Im worried because at my old job IT would perm ban people who used ethernet ports for internet due to the risk to the schools system. Then again, these where people who unplugged computers ethernet cords and plugged them into their laptops thinking its fine, lol.  <eos> \n",

Now that it's actually important I figured I would open it up to the community to see what people want.

            "<bos> What's up everyone! I'm a part of a group of 4 guys who will be living in a house off Mezerot next year. It is a 5 person place, so we are looking for one more! We're a group of 4 friends so the house is going to be kind of upbeat at most times, we are looking for someone who is pretty welcoming and down to go out and do stuff potentially. Some more about us: we are a pretty outgoing group, not loud but we definitely like to socialize. We are just as likely to go out on a weekend as we are to stay in and play Smash Bros or watch a movie and just chill. We're decently into sports: three of us go to Eppley pretty regularly to play basketball, and, we're planning on doing different intramurals next year. We're always looking to make more friends who go to UMD, so while it's cool if you're just looking for a place to live, we'd prefer people who would want to hang out as well!  The house itself is really nice. I have a photo gallery here:[url link] The photos are kind of shitty because I was in a rush, but if you're interested, we can for sure set up a tour so you can see everything. Rent would be 560 a month plus utilities. You'd be getting the master room, so you'd even have your own private bathroom! There's also a decently sized deck outside, so when it's warm out, that'll be a really cool place to chill. If you're looking for a place and think you'd be a good fit here, don't hesitate to hit me up! Just shoot me a PM on here, I'll be looking frequently the next few days. Thanks, looking forward to hearing from/and meeting you guys!  <eos> \n",

Pretty much, we want to see this guy as happy as he's ever been because he deserves it. And, by that we mean, we want to find him a special lady. The thing is, we don't want him knowing that we're pushing him to date again so we're trying to do this very subtly. He is willing to date but doesn't like when we get on his ass about it. In case you're interested in this wonderful fellow, he is currently twenty years old and (obviously) a student at UMD. He's studying geography. Outside of school, he's into skydiving, music, motorcycles, the outdoors, and science.

            "<bos> UMD has around ratio of 53.5 male : 46.5 female. [url link] National average for public schools is 43.6 male : 56.4 female [url link]  I've thought about this for a while but does anyone else find it interesting how this would affect the campus culture. Specifically dating?  I understand that it's not super precise since there are LGBT people and many people choose to avoid a relationship. But there must difference, not good or bad, between UMD and other public schools. At UMD girls can be more selective about their relationships compared to most other public schools where guys are the ones who can be selective. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So today after doing homework on my laptop and then taking a lunch break, I return to find a crack on my screen. I have no clue how that happened. When the screen is off, you can't see it but it's visible when the screen is on and it caused the rest of the screen to go black. That meant I had to turn in my laptop to IT to be sent to Apple to be fixed for an unknown amount of time. I was wondering what options I have to do homework without a laptop besides using a desktop at McKeldin. I was fine doing that earlier but I prefer to do homework alone as doing it in public is somewhat distracting. Also it's kind of annoying to have to walk 5 minutes to do homework. I'm fine with that but it does seem kind of annoying to have to walk back if you forgot to to an assignment or print out a paper you forgot to. Any suggestions for alternatives is appreciated. Thanks <eos> \n",

First Look Fair is the annual event where over 500 student groups, organizations, and departments will table out on the mall. It's a great way for students, especially underclassmen, to find ways to get involved and learn what this university has to offer. Here on /r/UMD, we host our own little virtual version of the First Look Fair. Feel free to promote groups that you are involved in. Be sure to give name and description of the group and add links to Facebook, Twitter, group emails, or ways to sign up. Just some advice to all the underclassmen: if you're interested in something, try it out. You might find out it's not your thing and never show up again but you might also meet some really cool people that share a similar interest and turn a hobby into a passion. There's over 800 active student groups so there's something for everyone and if you can't find exactly what you are looking for, you can even create your own group! *** *Additional Resources* * [First Look Fair 2015: Reddit Edition]([url link] * [First Look Fair 2016: Reddit Edition]([url link] * [OrgSync]([url link] - Browse student groups online <eos> \n",

I understand over-registering, but they cut off almost 150 people last night. That is absurd.  After the cutoff announcement, they continue to let people in on the condition that they do not get food. This process was impromptu and not organized.  Bitcamp has been on campus since 2014. I don't expect much from student-run events, and I am sure the organizers work very hard, but I think an event having three years of prior experience would be able to improve each year - it has not.  <eos> \n",

I'm wondering what life is like (socially/do you get lonely), what the best dorms to be an RA are, how easy it is to handle the kids, what responsibilities you're required to fulfill, or what the consequences are for not being strict (i.e. letting students off with a warning if caught with alcohol)?

Now I'm deciding whether I should withdraw from 1 of those classes and work really hard in the other 2 and try to get A's, or if I should just stick with it and push through these 3 classes and get average grades. I would rather not withdraw because I have a set four year plan, but it that's the best option, I'd do it. I'd appreciate any advice on this... Also how bad does a \"W\" look? Thanks!  <eos> \n",

We spent maybe 3 days doing integrals. Now I get to College Park and get into a Calc 2 class and right off the bat it's extreme integrals and other crazy stuff that I don't understand. I'm probably going to end up taking Calc 1 again to better prepare myself for Calc 2 so I wanted some info on how to audit the class/vs just retaking it.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm kinda freaking out because I'm right on the cusp of either a C for 250, depending on how the final goes today. I'm already signed up for 330 and 351 next fall, and in order to save time I need to get 250 out of the way asap.  If all goes wrong with this 250 exam, is a 216 and 250 during the summer a possible combo - as in, will the workload actually be feasible for a sped up summer course? (I know I can take both at the same time, no doubt about that) <eos> \n",

However we were not paired up and we are looking at the Room Swap/Exchange that UMD has. It says that the exchange is during mid semester.  Does anyone know if the room swap is possible before I move in? My requested roomate and I are both in ACES for Prince Frederick. I am also wondering if there are there alternative ways to do a room reassignment?  Thanks Terps. <eos> \n",

I've been here for 4 years and in that whole time I never noticed anyone outside of in the last few weeks. Tonight I walked by Starbucks and one guy, who seemed pretty nice actually, said he was homeless and asked for money or food. He didn't look so bad and actually when I walked out it sounded like he was talking to a friend on the phone trying to go hangout or something lol. Then a minute later there was another guy asking me if I had any spare change, again just an ordinary looking guy who didn't look like he was in very rough shape.  Having people like those around I mean.. if they really need help alright, but has this issue increased recently or has it always been around and I never noticed?   <eos> \n",

Also, if it does happen automatically, what if the course is added to someone's Testudo course schedule but they don't know it? Thanks! <eos> \n",

It is mainly scooters parking the perimeter (you cant complain that people are in front of you, ik people are not in the mornings). I cant fit anything past your scooters. If your worried about getting blocked in then move the idiots scooter who blocked you in, the rules go not to block people in and to leave a gap for people to exit or else they move your bike. This is common sense people, why is it so difficult, do we need slashed parking instead of a box? <eos> \n",

Quick facts: * Would like to move in on August 1st. (June 1st is potentially possible for a starting lease date, I would have a friend of mine sublet from me June and July) * Biking distance to campus * Must be non-student housing, but I am open to living with students. Just graduating myself, and open to continuing the college lifestyle for another year. * Must haves: Dishwasher, good internet, decent sized living room, parking * Would be nice: shuttle bus within walking distance * Probably one roommate for an apartment, but considering singles and larger groups for a house * Price: negotiable, but looking to go cheaper than not. A bit about me, as written by my girlfriend so I wouldn't have to describe myself: Recent college graduate, new to the area, interested in computers and technology, gaming, outdoor enthusiast (snowboarding, mountain biking, cycling). Enjoy going out and being social, but rarely bring the party back home. Respectful of others and generally agreeable, etc. I'm open to any suggestions or hearing from anyone who might be interested in finding a place together. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Quick backstory: Did college after highschool over 5 years ago. Got pretty bad grades. Decided I needed to fix myself and joined the United States Marine Corps....discharge 4 years later (July 2016). Went to Towson University for that next fall semester and got a GPA of 3.15. ^(which I'm proud of) I sent in an application to UMD for fall 2017 and was told by the admissions office that the better grades that I just got should definitely help my chances of getting accepted.  Just got this decision recently: ...we are unable to offer you a space in our Fall 2017 transfer class Our decision is based on a thorough review of all college-level work attempted at regionally accredited colleges or universities. Does anyone think it's possible for me to make the case that my past grades shouldn't reflect as the kind of student I am now?  <eos> \n",

She is a Junior transferring from another university, and is interested in living in an apartment (e.g., The View).  What's the security situation at the various apartment buildings? I realize that security is always the responsibility of the individual -- just thinking about access control (for example), security cameras, on-duty security / staff, etc.  Also, which apartments have good (or bad) maintenance / cleanliness?  Thanks for your advice.   <eos> \n",

So that way if I have 2k a month renting the other 4 rooms for 500 + utilities would pay for myself mostly. It seems like a good idea but what are some disadvantages?

            "<bos> Two years ago the website isawyoumaryland was created and I had people telling me I was popping up all over it as \"that tall kid\" who everyone wanted to meet. I didn't like the idea of people stalking me instead of getting to know me, so I decided, just as a joke, to make [this fan page]([url link] and see if the fans came out of hiding. I had always had people come up to me and tell me they see me all the time, but I had no idea to what degree this was true. I sent invites to twenty or thirty friends and went to bed. The next day I checked my page and it had over 500 likes. The strangest thing for me was I only recognized a fifth of them.  The page has been pretty dormant since and I still have people coming up to me all the time telling me they see me everywhere who are unaware of this page. This is my last semester at UMD and I was just wondering if I could get it to go viral for one more day. I figured I'd see who recognized me on Reddit when [this]([url link] happened to me on a completely different subreddit. So if you too see me everywhere feel free to [like the page]([url link] and spread it around to your friends who might see me everywhere as well. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Of particular interest to me is whether or not the RA Meet and Greets event on the 26th is worthwhile. And, if so, is there a way I can contact my RA ahead of time to ask the exact time of the event? The New Student Welcome is another event that might help me with time if it is not required or not really worth the time. On the 26th the Honors College has a required welcome at 12:30 p.m. and a lecture from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. which helps with the mandatory HONR 100 class. I need to take two exams (two hours each) that day, so I am trying to cut some time out of my schedule for that. Right now it seems the only time slots are 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. and maybe 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. Reference: [url link] <eos> \n",

Hackathons are a great opportunity for students to learn, network, and take part in an awesome community. The basic idea of a hackathon is that we have companies that come and sponsor the event, and they have competitions for a specific software or a specific problem, and people can submit their solutions to try to win prizes. Plus, it's completely free, including meals. And if you don’t feel too confident with your hacking abilities, or don't have nay experience with CS at all, don’t worry, because Bitcamp has so many opportunities to learn. We host workshops, which are lectures given by sponsors and specialists to learn more about things like mobile dev, graphic design, or hardware. We also have mentors throughout the event there to support you and help any way they can. We have people from all majors come and participate, especially because you can join a team and provide your own expertise in whatever you're good at, even if it isnt coding.  So I encourage everyone to register. But more than that, in order for Bitcamp to function, we need volunteers to help us make it happen. So if you have any availability that weekend and think you might be able to help us, please sign up at [url link] . If you sign up as a volunteer or mentor, you automatically get access to all the free meals and all the events during the weekend. We really appreciate any help you can give us. See you by the campfire! <eos> \n",

But I would also like to hear what other have to say. As fate would have it, I interviewed Reinhardt for my COMM 107 class and was initially adamant about having him because he seemed very cool until I saw the reviews for his classes. I probably will keep Herman, but I just want to hear the word of some others that have had either him or Reinhardt recently. <eos> \n",

He was saying in class that a D student should get their shit together, and a F student should just drop.  While I did the practice tests and studied I was doing fine, yet this test was unlike any of them. Even my TA said that he doesn't know why he did this to us. What do I do.

            "<bos> I'd like a little help with possibly dropping a class. Currently, I'm scheduled for 16 credits my upcoming semester. With 21 dual campus credits from a local CC, I can drop a class and still reach 45 credits by the end of my freshman year. This will allow me to apply to the business school. I have a few options: **Drop ECON200** I'm not a fan of this option. If I don't get accepted to Smith, ECON is the back up option. However, I do have a 4.0 after 21 credits and ECON appears to be the hardest course this upcoming semester.  **Drop STAT100** The only reason I'm taking this class is to prepare myself for Business Stats next semester. This class fills zero requirements. How closely related are STAT100 and Business Stats. Should I drop this class? **Drop KNES287** This class seems like it'll be fun and easy. I'm really looking forward to it. However, it only fills one requirement. Should I drop it to concentrate on my other courses? **Keep all 16 credits**  Thanks guys. I know this is a probably annoying. <eos> \n",

As of what I know, umd has a marching band and color guard, so I'm looking forward to joining it (guard), and I have a few questions for those who are in or have done it before. 1. Apparently band/guard people move in a week early to get prepared and all, but I don't think I'll be able to do that due to familly issues. Will I still be able to join? Would it hurt me much? (I've spun flags for two years so I'm pretty familiar with what I do tho not like super good at it) 2. Does umd has winter guard as well? I'd appreciate any other comment too :) <eos> \n",

I guess this question could apply to other clubs as well, but is it still worth going to club meetings at a later date? Would I be missing out, especially on a social aspect, that it wouldn't be worth the time? I'm still a novice at the whole club culture here, so I can see this as not being the smartest of questions, but I would just like to know so I can plan what to do later on. <eos> \n",

This confused me because I definitely purchased one and was parked in the correct lot. I even went online to confirm the license plate, car, etc. was correct so I knew something was wrong. Called them and they said it was a mistake, so I figured no harm done. Then today I arrive at my car to find a $75 fine.... What really annoys me is the fact that I've been parking there since the semester started with no issue. So I don't know why this is happening.  Gonna call them again when they open but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? <eos> \n",

I emailed my TA at 7AM on Thursday bc the test is Friday and so I thought emailing 24 hours before would prove Im actually sick.

I acn't even make it out of my bed... And by the time i have the energy TO make it to the UHC I feel better enough to say Im not that sick and they wouldn't give me a note. I couldn't sleep all night wednesday so I sort of horrible half slept throughout the whole day and I wake up at 9 still feeling like shit. IDK what to do.

I have a little bit of anxiety in taking ENEE350: 1) programming is the toughest part of EE for me (sometimes to the point of looking like gibberish),  2) I repeated the prerequisite course ENEE244 (I withdrew the first time since I felt genuinely lost - 0s and 1s are less straightforward to me than manipulating formulas..but I got a B the second time after genuinely trying - I reviewed my notes/textbook over summer break, worked with a tutor, and looked over practice exams from multiple professors). <eos> \n",

Is it common for freshmen to be tripled up like this? I know most people do not prefer a triple, so I figured us requesting one basically guaranteed us a room together. Will we be placed in a larger room? Was there something more we should’ve done besides all requesting each other as roommates? Any reassurance would be great! <eos> \n",

I have to take a few classes out of my department, and I'm trying to figure out when they're generally offered. In the Schedule of Classes on Testudo you can only see Fall 2013, Winter 2014, Spring 2014 and Summer 2014. I was wondering if there's a way to go back and see if certain courses were offered in like 2012-2013 or 2011-2012. I've been emailing individual professors, but some departments rotate who teaches classes, so I thought it might be easier to see historically in the past few years if certain courses are offered like fall only or spring only or both. I found the archives of Course Catalogs through the library, but they don't indicate when classes were offered :( Thanks for the help and hope all of your finals are going well!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm trying to transfer into Smith from CMNS. I only have a 3.0 right now but I'm just starting the business pre reqs this semester.  Is 3.5 a good number to get into Smith? I've heard different things from people. Some say higher than 3.5, which seems like craziness.  Anyone have any experience or advice?

            "<bos> I was invited for an interview for a full time position with the option of working part time until graduation. I was actually looking for an internship but would be more than happy to to get experience. Problem is they are too far to commute to for part time work. It's kind of pointless to hold this offer for more than 2 year until graduation.  I'm a CS major taking CMSC 132 with GPA 3.6 and I did an unpaid internship before. What should I do in my case? <eos> \n",

Buffalo Wild Wings aren't the greatest, but I can still enjoy them. I'm looking for some really spicy, but tasty wings. If anyone could give me recommendations, that'd be awesome. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I recently borrowed a cap and gown set from a prior grad, but they didn't have the BA hood that comes with it (I believe it's white for BA). Does any prior grad have one I can borrow/have for the ceremony, or is there any way I can obtain one before Saturday? The book store's website says they only sell cap/gown stuff as a whole set.  Thanks in advance *edit just realized I typed Bachelor's instead of Bachelor.  <eos> \n",

Looking for: -Easy to schedule an appointment  -HIV and your common STD tests need to be done  -preferably cheap or insurance friendly  -Fast results would be nice, but not 100% needed  -Preferably easy in easy out (not wasting a bunch of time sitting around in a room waiting)  **tl;dr need to get a wiener inspection** <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys I was thinking of just walking around a bit just t get a feel for where everything is. I mean, I know what most of the buildings are and where on a map, but haven't really seen campus except for my Banneker/Key interview. Anyone have any tips/suggestions of things I should definitely see or do? Also do you think I could get away with walking in buildings if I pretend that I know what I'm doing and have things to do? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Making my first sem schedule, all the sections of MATH 241 conflicted with BIOE 121. They said I could split BIOE 120 and 121 across fall/spring semesters, so that's what I did. Just wondering how good/bad idea that is, and if I should keep looking at ways to shift things around to put them both in this semester or put them both off to spring? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm sorta pissed at McKeldin right now. I was just in there getting my study on for a few hours, starting at 8pm. I had a sweet set-up on the 3rd floor with access to an outlet.  Life is good; I'm successfully cramming for a final until 10:55 when some dude walks by and says \"3rd-7th floors closing in five.\" I thought I wouldn't have to deal with this problem since it's finals week. So I begrudgingly pack up and try to snag a spot on the lower floors. The second floor -newly dubbed Terrapin Commons- was a shit show. I couldn't even hear myself think. The entire floor had turned into a massive loud-ass group study.  Off the first floor I went. Yeah right. That shit is packed too. Fuck you McKeldin. Now here I am, at my non-study friendly home, ranting to Reddit. Just felt like letting it out. Thanks if you read this.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm creating/teaching a new 400 level CS course this Fall that will introduce CS students to wireless communications, digital signal processing, and how to program and use software-defined radios. If you have ever wondered how your cellphone communicates with a base station or want a class that actually involves hardware, this could be for you. It's going to be a fairly small class, and I'm going to try to make it heavy on the \"learning by doing\" and light on the math, there's not enough time in the semester to dive into the math in all honesty. We will use GNU Radio as part of the course. The only pre-req is that you have taken at least one 400 level course, and are a CS student. Feel free to PM me if you think you might be interested and I can help you figure out if it's a good fit. It's listed as CMSC498X on the registrar.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was offered admission for the spring semester with a computer science major but I only just received my letter online a few days ago (received it on March 23rd) and I can't enroll yet either because they asked me to verify my financial aid and I don't know how long that will take. Since everything is so late and it'll probably take a while for the school to process my financial aid, I don't think I'll get a spot in Freshman Connection if I enroll because it's first come, first serve. AND SO I was just wondering whether anyone had any suggestions as to what I should do for a semester if I don't get into Freshman Connection. Some have suggested that I take some general classes at my local college. Traveling also sounds fun but if I were to travel during the fall, I want it to be productive and I want to volunteer while traveling. thoughts? <eos> \n",

I didn't discuss it with my advisor, but I was under the impression that it was not a mandatory course, and he has never said anything about it. I've since declared a major. I was just talking with friends, and someone told me they were pretty sure UNIV100 was required. Am I now fucked and am I gonna have to take UNIV 100 as a sophomore or something??? Thanks  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> **Warning: Rant** I got back to my car two minutes before meter expired and I was shocked to see a DOTS truck next to my car. As I got closer, I double checked both parking receipt and time (2 mins before limit). The DOTS guy tried to tell me that I'm getting a parking ticket so I told him that I still had two minutes and took out my receipt. He and another DOTS person in the car looked at each other and didn't hand me the physical ticket. I thought that was the end of it but when I checked my parking account, there was a citation for the \"expired meter\".  So, this is just a heads up to everyone. Luckily, I had my receipt and appealed but not sure what DOTS is going to try next. Seriously, this campus is awful because of them.  **edit:** So they voided the ticket but I still want to get the word out to as many people as possible. From the suggestions, I'll try to tweet them (don't have twitter account yet), email President Loh, and try to file a complaint to DOTS (doubt they would do anything about it). It would really help if you guys also did the same. Thanks.  <eos> \n",

I'm trying to upgrade to a custom PC that I leave at home, and a cheap Google Chromebook that I take with me on campus for very light note-taking and whatnot. Is the Google Chromebook good enough as an engineering student? I guess a better question is are all/most engineering classes that require autoCAD, Inventor, MATLAB, etc. in computer labs? Just trying to gauge whether my home PC and portable Chromebook idea would work. Oh and if type of engineering matters, I'm doing Mech E. <eos> \n",

If I buy a random $20 ticket on StubHub for anywhere in the lower section of the stadium, will I probably be able to slide into the UMD student section?

If there IS an access code, does anyone know where to buy it for cheaper than the $101 package on the UBC website? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I have a two part question: one pertaining to Econometrics next semester, the other about internships in general:  1. Alka Gandhi is teaching Econometrics 1 next semester. I'm looking at the planetterp data currently  her class GPA is a 2.03 (median is a C) + 14% fail rate). What makes her class so difficult? Is it a lot of Stata proofs? No curve? Not enough homework? 2. The follow-up question has to do with trying to land internships: So my GPA is currently a 3.06, I could push Econ422 back a semester and take Econ406 instead (the teacher has a 3.17 GPA for that class). From my understanding Econometrics is the most important class in the B.S curriculum, so it would be nice having that class under my belt before summer of 2019. Should I take Econ 406 instead, keeping my GPA above 3.0+ going into next summer  work on Python/SQL/Excel skills as well. Or should I take Econ 422 and risk gutting my GPA below a 3.0 going into next summer? Tl;dr - Econ 422 is important to take but may affect my internship chances if I drop below a 3.0. Do I worry about the classes I've taken, or worry about my GPA for an internship next summer? (This would also be the last summer before I graduate, worth noting). <eos> \n",

All the courses I took there are transferrable, but I am a little confused on the actual process of transferring credits. Do I simply send a copy of my transcript from the other school to the registrar's office at UMD or is it more complicated? Any and all help is appreciated. Super happy to be coming back! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Location: Stamp Atrium Time: Thursday, 09/20/2012 3:15PM-5:00PM In case you weren't aware, the University Senate is voting TODAY, Thursday 9/20, on whether to make syllabi more easily accessible for students at the time of registration. The SGA, student senators, and many student groups have all mobilized over the past two weeks to see this through. Some organizations that have announced their support for the bill are:  -SGA  -RHA Exec Board  -IFC  -Numerous other student groups, fraternities, sororities, performance groups, and academic organizations have also backed the bill. Last year, after +/- grading successfully passed the senate, most students heard about it when it was already too late. Even a petition with thousands of student signatures could not change the policy which had already been decided. The only prior notice to most students before then were 2 articles in the diamondback over the entire semester, which were buried in the middle of the newspaper.  This year, we want to keep policies that will have such an adverse effect on students from passing as they have in previous years. There have now been several articles on this syllabus bill in the diamondback, including one on the front page above the fold. A few of those articles were in this week's diamondbacks. You can see the articles below.  Today, from 3:15PM-5PM (often ends earlier) is the senate meeting, where student senators you elected will vote on the issue. The meeting takes place in the Stamp student union in the Atrium (1st floor. From Testudo by the information desk, go towards the food court, first door on your left.) If you have time, please join us and show up in support of the bill. In the past, most students have not heard about legislation or even that there is a University Senate that decides things that will affect them. Help us to change this and show the faculty and staff we care about our education and the university where most of us will spend 4 or more years studying.  Again, this takes place TODAY, at 3:15PM in the Stamp Atrium.

            "<bos> I used to go to visit my sister at UMD back around 2005-6, and she would take me to the food Co-Op. From what I remember, the place smelt peculiar, had anti-Bush signs **everywhere**, and the guy behind the counter wore a military jacket. They sold interesting things alongside their food, including a lip balm that included THC. They had some short aisles that had dried fruit and other things.  I visited UMD for the first time in a while (3-4 years), and rushed to the Food Co-op to see if it was still like how I remembered it. However, it seemed to really change. The lighting was better, they had fewer aisles. The only decoration seemed to be a lonesome Morrisey off to the side. The person running the cash register wore a t-shirt, and not a military jacket.  Now, don't get me wrong. The Food Co-Op was still awesome. The food options were great and the service was friendly. However, I couldn't tell if my memories were incorrect. I was pretty young at the time (12-13), so my mind could have made certain details a lot more grand.  Does anyone know if the Food Co-Op went through some transition in the years that I hadn't visited UMD during?  (Semi-Related: As a commuter who has to pay for lunch but doesn't have time to pick up a part-time job, the \"Volunteer for $7/hour in food credit\" deal listed on their facebook page seems awesome. Has anyone done this and know how I can work that out with them?)  <eos> \n",

I read some colleges try to block torrents and others track it back to the room and give warnings. I won't dl anything too large, just the occasional TV show or program. I use PeerBlock and download unpopular torrents to give myself some security from the Anti-P2P companies, but will UMD monitor internet activity without a copyright notice from an anti-p2p? <eos> \n",

I was curious for those of you who have seen a Terps game there before, is there a student section for Maryland students, or is it more spread out? Before I buy tickets I would just like to get an idea if there is a \"visitor\" side or not. I am looking at section 129. Thank you for your help!  <eos> \n",

This, plus the fact that UMPD has essentially stopped reporting the race of suspects in UMD alerts (see [url link] suggests that we are becoming increasingly PC.

The advisors didn't really explain to me the difference between the BS/BA. I said I don't really want to get a PhD, so they said to take the BA. Not really sure the difference yet. What were your guys experience in either major academically and job/internship wise? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently a freshman, and was assigned to a suite. I have no idea how I got so lucky, as most freshmen seem to have been placed in north campus, but now I'm wondering if it was luck at all. I have met very few people so far, and essentially none in my dorm, as most people living in suites are juniors who don't leave their suite to socialize or anything like that. The only \"friends\" I've made so far have been from people in my classes, but these aren't really even real friendships. I've basically lost the whole social scene that is living in a traditional residence hall, and am just isolated in this suite. I see other freshmen with large groups of friends hanging out and going to parties and such, and I can't imagine how that came to be for them, other than from meeting people on their floor. Even from clubs I'm not sure how one builds a group for themselves. Did other people who lived in suites have this same problem? If so, how did you deal with it? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm an engineering major, but I'm looking to take BMGT343 (for whatever reason, it just so happens to be on the list of approved technical electives for my degree). I have a few questions about registering for it. - What are my odds of getting in? From what I understand, the business school drops all restrictions for upper level BMGT courses on the first day of classes, so that would be my earliest chance to register. - How difficult is the class? - Who should I take it with? The listed instructors are: Xiaohui Bakshi and Russell Wermers (Mark Loewenstein's section times conflict with my schedule) Thanks! <eos> \n",

Where are the microwaves? Am I allowed to use them?  Luckily I've been building off of someone's brilliant idea to map out these locations and have been compiling a bigger list (with pictures and descriptions/restrictions) as well as putting in some new locations where I've actually set-up microwaves for general use.  [UMD Microwaves Google Map]([url link] If anyone else knows about more on-campus locations with microwaves available to students and wants to contribute to this map, then please feel free to do so. If you feel compelled to help in the effort of adding more microwaves to buildings (nothing new or fancy, used and functional is definitely preferred), please leave a comment below.

I am from a state other than Maryland and would like to know a little more about the process. I will most likely rent an apartment next year and by the summer before my sophomore year I should have a Maryland license and also be registered to vote here so I will have fulfilled those requirements stated in the reclassification policy. <eos> \n",

I know this has been asked a million times and I've read a good bit of the threads here with advice.  Everyone seems to have their path pretty figured out. I really don't. I honest to god hate math, it's a fear and anxiety that's haunted me forever. But I've taken 2 programming into courses at a CC (C++  Java) and I actually had some fun learning to program. I'm also trying to wrap my mind around hardware and how it works (networks and all that). Currently I work with HTML/CSS full time, light stuff.  Am I totally insane for considering this program given how theoretical and math-heavy it is? I do want to conquer my math anxiety. I guess I'm either looking for some support and advice as a non-traditional student (mid 20's chick with a full time job) or have some sense smacked into me. Thanks! EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses. I appreciate any and all insights into the major. I'm like thirsty for info, so keep posting if you have anything at all to share with me. My decision about going for it is formulating as I type. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I want to ask this sub bc the CS dept discourages exemption testing. A couple questions: 1. If I'm taking a summer CS131 course at CC, do I take the Standard Letter grading system OR am I allowed to take the audit version of the course, then take the placement exam? Credit vs Audit? 2. The website discourages self-studying for an exemption exam but I'm wondering if we could? Like are there any prereqs in order to take an exemption exam? (250 in particular)  3. What are the consequences of not passing a placement test?   <eos> \n",

I'm considering switching into it, since the seminar topic looks pretty interesting to me, but I don't want to get locked into something less interesting/more work than I had hoped. That being said, does anyone have any thoughts on the course, or the professor (Niranjan Ramachandran)? Workload and grading scheme is definitely most important to me, but any thoughts on the class in general (or suggestions for other classes) are appreciated. P.S. I would take it mostly to satisfy my humanities credit... just thought I'd add that.  <eos> \n",

UMD is one of the best universities for CS and I was wondering, what kind of internships do students get and when do they usually get them? Is there a nice start up around UMD for any internships there? Also, when do students start learning their major, some colleges make you take classes after the end of your sophomore year but how does UMD do it? Finally, are the cs courses that are taught really theoretical, technical, or a mix of both. Thank you! <eos> \n",

We both registered our devices (His laptop  PS4, my own HP 2560p laptop) on connect.umd.edu, and it worked earlier yesterday, but for some odd reason it's not working anymore. I bought a 25-foot cable from the bookstore but the resident life website requires a cable no longer than 14 feet?  I know this could be a networking issue on my laptop, but so far I've reinstalled my drivers and re-registered the device AND tried my roommate's ethernet cable, which is shorter. Anyone have a solution to this, or why the reslife website wants less than 14 feet of cable? I'm not too keen on networking, so an external link to a more relevant website could help. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys, I have a few questions regarding my scheduling. First off, I know the common answer to waitlist classes are \"it depends what the class is.\" For a big class like MATH240 the chances of me grabbing a spot be fairly good? The minimum position I'm in is 5 for that class and the maximum position is 8. The professor is the same throughout all the sections-- Vincent Lucarelli. Is he any good? I tried to check ourumd, but he doesn't have a page. The other class I'm worried about is MATH246. The only professor open is Ronald Lipsman, and I don't want to take him and I can't due to schedule confliction. My minimum position for other professors that teaches this course are 13 and the maximum position is 26. Does that mean the chances of me getting this class is fairly slim? Finally, does anyone know what Gadi Fibich or Elizabeth Wilson is like? I know this is a handful of questions, and I really appreciate you guys taking the time to read this. Even answering one of the questions would help so much. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> 75 dollars for a ticket is such a money grab, especially as UMD supposedly views students as a community not just people whom they should squeeze money from.  If you currently work for dots, think long and hard about what you're doing. If you work for UMD's alumni relations, you will double your donations by fixing DOTS. <eos> \n",

Currently, I'm scheduled to be taking 15 credits: CMSC 132 (4 credits) MATH 240 (4) PHYS 102 (3) PHYS 103 (1) PSYC 100 (3) I am asking for opinions for whether or not adding ENES140 to this schedule would be feasible or if it would add way to much stress to be worth it. I've heard ENES140 is incredibly easy and I figured it'd be a simple way to get a DSSP out of the way during a semester that (I believe and am hoping) won't be that bad. To anyone that has taken my current courses as well as ENES140, do you think adding it would be too much headache? Also, I am aware I cannot schedule above 16 credits before the start of the school year. I am just planning ahead.  <eos> \n",

As a member of one of the groups on campus I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the audition process or about being in an a cappella group in general. I also know that there are members of a bunch of the other campus groups here on reddit, so I'm sure they can chime in as well if you have group-specific questions. <eos> \n",

I am interested in Oakland or Prince Frederick, I know these are the nicer/newer dorms so I know they're in higher demand. I am a transfer student with 62 credits so I am not sure if that makes a difference or not. Also when would I hear back about my housing options? Like October, November etc?  <eos> \n",

I was reading the syllabus and noticed there is only a midterm and a final. I attended a lecture on Thursday and saw that he moved really fast and gave a lot of information in just one lecture. For the exams, does he generally do a good job explaining what he expects us to know for exams or is all information he throws out liable to be tested? I also noticed he give homework every week, how long does one assignment usually take and how harshly graded are they? <eos> \n",

Bungie has yet to comment on the growing issue thread on their support website. Hopefully in the next couple of days they will, but I'm just posting to bring the issue to light. Hoping that /u/umdnocguy will take a look at it, but there might not be much he can do until Bungie clarifies and suggests a fix.

Unfortunately the one I ordered online came today and I can't return the other clicker to the bookstore. So if anyone of you guys needs a clicker like NOW let me know. It doesn't have the LCD screen but its still turning tech. Here's a generic stock photo of what it looks like.  [url link] But if you're interested. PM me. I'm asking $30 OBO for it.

I really like sublime, but I believe all the compiling/work is done on the grace server, so I'd need to constantly copy over code if I did that? Or is there a workaround for sublime use :D  I have a macbook if that makes a difference Thank you!  PS. Any tips for 250 w/ Jason?  <eos> \n",

Didn’t think much of it at first until I realized it wasn’t local birds or even migratory birds. The sounds are definitely some kind of tropical bird or Bird of Paradise. I know they have speakers set up but what the heck is it and why would they keep playing it randomly?? <eos> \n",

The grading for this class is definitely +/- because another student had a 94 but they have a A- on the transcript. There was literally no other assignments he had graded so the drop on our grades is no just. One student went from an A to a B.  The teacher is out of the country now and I bet several other students probably tried to contact him by now. Who do I contact to change this and is it too late?  Class is engl101 btw <eos> \n",

I live on campus so its not like she can just park by my building.  None of the visitor parking mentioned online is overnight, and I don't think the college park metro would be a safe place to leave her car for a whole weekend. So does anyone know of a good place?

            "<bos> So for those of you who have taken 3 (400-level) cmsc classes in the same semester or know how it works, do we first register for two courses and then wait until the beginning of spring semester to register for the third? Also, if this is so, can we do it right away without permission or do we need permission from the CS advisor once the first day of the semester starts? I believe we do need permission before the semester starts (for seats) but I want to know if we would need it once/after the semester starts (given their are available seats)? <eos> \n",

But due to some unforeseeable changes to my work/school schedule I don't think I'll be able to manage TAing anymore. Would I make it difficult on the professor if I told him I can no longer TA or is it a reasonable amount of time for before the semester for him to find a replacement? Or if I stayed on as a TA, is it possible to strictly help grade versus having to hold office hours? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I'm an incoming exchange student, and I can pick courses within basically every college agreement. At home I'm basically a Software Engineering undergraduate student, which yeah, is equivalent to your Computer Science department. So, I need at least 12 credits, where 6 of them will be within the CS department, and I think I'll pick the following two of the following courses within the CS department: CMSC414 Computer and Network Security (Michael Marsh) CMSC417 Computer Networks (Ashok Agrawala) CMSC411 Computer Systems Architecture (already full, I've kinda been screwed by the exchange coordinator, but I'll see what I kind do about it) CMSC330 Organization of Programming Languages I've been following this subreddit for a while, and seems like people aren't really happy with the Michael Marsh guy? My question is basically if any of you guys will recommend/discourage some of the above courses? Any input is welcomed :-) Part two of my post, is also related to Non-CS courses, but still within the Engineering-ish field. My intention is to pretty much, you know, experience the American college culture (go terps haha!), and therefore have as much free time as possible. So if you have any suggestions for chill courses, which is maybe within the ENES department, or some kind of Science-ish related (preferably where the gender distribution isn't 95% dudes haha), so I'll be possible to transfer the credits back home it would be much welcomed. I'd be preferable if it was courses where there is some kind of group work, or classes where there is social interaction between the students. At the moment I think I'll be looking at courses such as: ENES474: International Business Cultures in Engineering and Technology ENCE320: Introduction to Project Management ENES140: Introduction to New Ventures ENES100: Introduction to Engineering Design ASTR100: Introduction to Astronomy :-P Yeah, a bit of a long post but anything is appreciated :-)    <eos> \n",

            "<bos> **TL;DR**: Any general advice for a socially anxious second semester freshman who had a pretty poor experience his first semester? I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Basically, I had a pretty crappy first semester here at UMD, but I really think the school has a lot to offer and I'd like to give it some more time before I decide to transfer or drop out. First semester I didn't really make any friends or talk to anyone on my floor (partially because of my weird housing assignment) and I didn't join any clubs. Academically I think I am doing better, despite the lack of a declared major, but I'm so tired of feeling lonely and not being able to spend time with friends. I have a few potential clubs picked out, but I don't have a lot of strong interests, so I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and/or has any advice for meeting people or good general clubs to get involved in. Thanks in advance, and sorry for the wall of text. Edit: thank you everyone so much for your advice and kind words. I'll definitely be going to stampfest and I just might take you up on some of your offers and pm you :) <eos> \n",

I was wondering if it would be possible, or if any of you have heard of people working with Smith professors on different research projects.  I'd probably be able to help out with some sorts of statistical analysis, as I'm relatively familiar with R and excel. I'm not sure how common this is, which is why I'm asking over here.  Thanks. Edit: I'm definitely not as familiar with R and excel as those are who've taken upper level statistics courses, as /u/EricForman19 mentioned. Still, I'd be interested to find out what types of things I might be able to help out with within Smith itself, as I have a strong interest in Finance, as well as its crossover into Computer Science. <eos> \n",

I definitely plan on taking OS next semester, so how is Jeffrey Hollingsworth for the class? I'm thinking of taking data structures too, but I'm probably not gonna go with Hugue(I don't have a death wish), so how is Larry Davis? I'm not sure what other CS course to take since many of them are either hard or if they're not, they seem to be poorly managed. I'm sure I'm probably wrong, but I can't seem to find a 3rd CS course that is not coding(since 412 and 420 will take care of that) but is also interesting and not too hard, so I'd appreciate any advice. I play on talking to my advisor during my appointment too, but I want to come in with a game plan first.  <eos> \n",

Could you please list some CS-related clubs that are still active? Thanks. <eos> \n",

When you end up with a problem while doing homework its nice being able to get an idea of what you're doing wrong and how to fix it. You can download and install Mathematica 9 from Terpware ([url link] \"You can access the Wolfram|Alpha engine directly from within Mathematica. Inside a Mathematica notebook document, just type == at the beginning of a line; you’ll get an orange Spikey icon indicating that Mathematica is ready to perform a Wolfram|Alpha query.

            "<bos> So I'm having a dilemma about housing next year, I don't know where to live. It has been hard for me to make friends because my current dorm floor is not the most social, and other circumstances too. I would like to live somewhere I could socialize with others, however, I think I would be happiest in a place where I have a kitchen (diner food is not working with me, I can't do it anymore) and additional living space. If I were to live in an apartment style dorm, I worry that I'll have a hard time meeting new people. If I were to live in Oakland, I would be so far away from everything (except the gym and 251), but it's the nicest dorm on campus (along with PF). How social are people in Oakland, would it be the same level as a South campus apartment? What do you guys think?  <eos> \n",

As a result, when I took CHEM135 and MATH140 this fall and they kicked my ass. I did well in my ENG and FMSC course, but it wasn't enough to save my GPA.  Now on academic probation and with no clear sense of what I'd like to pursue major wise I was wondering what I'm looking at moving forward this semester. Can I still register for classes?

            "<bos> Hello, everyone! As stated in the title of this post, I just received my acceptance to UMD-College Park as a transfer to finish my B.S. in Physics (yay). Anyway, I currently live in Georgia, but am wanting to move up to Maryland. I have a medium-sized chocolate lab I'd like to be able to bring with me. Is it reasonable for a 21 year old college student to find a place with a fenced in yard? If not, how are the dorms at UMD?  Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I accidentally purchased an ExpertTA access code for my physics lab, but apparently it's not needed this time around (oops). Does anybody need to purchase one for any of the Physics labs (174, 275, 276...)? It's typically about $60.00 at the UMD bookstore, but I'll sell for much less. PM me your offer if you're interested. Have a great day =) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I recently switched over to B.A Econ major. My advisor said I'll only need 4 semesters to graduate, taking 2-3 courses a semester. I was thinking of either adding the math major - statistical track, or the statistics minor. How doable is the double major, especially in 4 semesters (not including winter and summer sessions, which I will also be taking). I've already covered Math240, 241, and 246. I've heard the really tough courses are MATH310 and MATH410. Are the stat courses especially tough? I was ChemE before switching and did ok (mostly Bs), so I've been through really tough courses before. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm looking into the UMD website as well, but I was wondering if any of you knew: Do you think it's doable or even possible to maybe get a double degree in something like Computer science and English, or compsci and spanish. Right now I'm a computer science major, but I want to write novels (I'm writing one right now that I've been developing on and off since I was 15) I'm really just throwing ideas out there, I'm aware that it's easier and cheaper to just practice writing by myself, and maybe take creative writing workshops. But then again, maybe a degree in english wouldn't be a bad idea either. Thoughts? <eos> \n",

I am interested in marching next year but I am worried it will monopolize my time and I would like to extend myself and experience as much as I can. So to any current marching band members, is it possible to march and have the time to study and do other things outside of band? I play trumpet btw. Thanks for the help, and go terps! <eos> \n",

I usually don't get bothered at all. As a reminder, cyclists can ride in the rightmost lane of almost any road other than highways, mandated by the state of Maryland. There are even signs about every mile along route 1 reminding people \"cyclist may use full lane.\" Please don't be an asshole. I guarantee that you will get to your destination in the same amount of time. Thanks. <eos> \n",

Both are great schools, but Maryland is pretty well known. Any advice? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The car I have been driving (2005 Honda CRV) is getting a bit sad and either way it is time for me to get a car of my own since I am moving soon. I have been looking at smaller SUVs (I liked my CRV). I like the idea of being able to move most (or all) of my stuff in my car since I will be moving a lot. I also do not want a large SUV as the gas mileage gets worse the larger it is and I don't have the need for that much space. There is no point in spending more money for something I don't need. To prevent headaches (and hopefully keep the car a long time) I am looking for something between 2015\\-2018. I will likely get a used car. I have narrowed it down to the following cars: \\- Subaru Forester  \\- Honda CRV  \\- Toyota RAV4  \\- Nissan Rogue Now for the request: If anyone currently on campus has any of these cars in that appx year range and wouldn't mind setting aside some time to show me their car and tell me what they like/ don't like about it I would really appreciate it! I would much prefer to hear about the car from someone who actually drives the car over someone just trying to sell it.  Less important but also helpful, if people have helpful opinions on this subject that they would like to share I'm all ears.  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

After all of the money that UMD sucks out of us all year, I think it'd be nice to be able to get Chick-Fil-A every once in a while without taking money out of our own pocket. What I'm trying to say is, we should be able to put the food court at Stamp on the TerpBucks plan. I don't know if this could work, or if a petition would do anything, but it's just a thought. <eos> \n",

The market is held in the parking lot at 4500 Knox Road, just across from Cornerstone.

Currently I am a CC student, and I'm looking to transfer to UMD next year (fall 2015). This fall I'll be taking 3 gateway courses (English, BMGT220, ECON200) that is required for Smith. After that is done with, I have 4 gateway courses left (ECON 201,BMGT230,BMGT221,MATH220) that I want to take for spring 2015. Apparently, I can't take more than 2 gateway courses in the same semester that I want to apply for admission to Smith. Can I take 2 gateway courses at my CC spring 2015 transfer to UMD via MTAP take the remaining 2 required gateway courses to Smith in fall 2015 and then apply for admission?  <eos> \n",

I have 7 400 level MATH classes left to take and 5 400 level CMSC classes left to take and tech writing in 3 semesters. Next semester I was thinking of taking CMSC412, CMSC456, CMSC460/CMSC466, and MATH410. I'm definitely taking 410, the other classes are flexible, but I think next semester is gonna be my 3 math class semester since I have 7 to take in 3 semesters. Any tips on how manageable this schedule is (I have a 3.98) and good professors or professors to avoid (Ashok for 412, Lawerence or Katz for 456, Chadwick or Gulick or Bedrossian or Fitzpatrick for 410)? Also for someone good at Math which is better to take between 460 and 466. Thanks  <eos> \n",

But what about professors who don't give a curve (either because that's there policy or because the class mean was pretty high), do they generally round off percentages? <eos> \n",

However, I only have one final a day, and I would really rather not walk all the way to campus if I only have to be on campus for an hour or two.

I should mention I went to a CC before this, so by credit I am a Sophmore and not entirely new to College. Current Schedule: CMSC 131 with William Pugh (I'll most likely be testing out of it and doing 132 though. If I get into 132 I will be dropping one course).  Math 140 with Steven Chadwick ENES140 with James Green ENEE200 with Nicole Mogul SOCY100 with Robert Pernick  CMSC131 will be pretty easy for me if I take it. Plenty of prior programming experience. Math 140 is going to be where the majority of my effort gets put into.  The other 3 classes I hear are very low workload and very easy As, and judging by ourumd that's the case. That's got me thinking about taking a 4th gen ed credit that's also a very easy A. I'm wondering if I'm being overzealous here? Is what I already have too much? If not what courses would you recommend? Does anyone have any experience with Dr Mogul? Reviews say she's fabulous, but hearing firsthand experiences is always nice. Same thing goes with Professor Green. On ourumd the grades are very high, but the reviews state some horror stories. Anybody experience those? I'm a little concerned since it's an online only course and he's the only professor for about 2000 students. In terms of the times of my classes, they're all condensed into 3 days of the week for the most part. I'll be out of class by 12 on Tuesdays and Thursdays and will have the entire day to do homework or study. On MW I'll be out by 3:45. On Friday I'll be out at 5:50. I will be living on campus.

I know comp sci is more theoretical and engineering would involve a lot more electrical engineering and circuitry but I can see myself being a bit more hardware oriented than software oriented. Right now I'm considering taking the prereqs in order to switch over to the Clark school but I'm still on the edge.

I honestly did not do so well on the first exam and looking back at it, I made many careless, trivial errors. Exam 2 is two weeks away and I defs want to avoid doing bad on this one. Does anyone have any experience with the second midterm Herman gives out? Or maybe just some general studying ideas!

Just wanted to know any tips related to scheduling courses, I know CS requires Math 140 and Univ100, I am in AP calc but want to retake it. I have some people from my school going but I'm not 100 percent certain they are the type of people I'd want to room with, would be less risky than a random person though, but if I did it would end up being 3-4 of us so housing recommendations based on that if possible. They are all fall admittance I think if that matters. Also I hear the new dining plan sucks but any info/suggestions on that?  <eos> \n",

I'm just wondering when exactly I'll lose access to services like library, terpware, on-campus internet, etc. Of course, they typically don't let you access these once you're no longer a student. Should I expect them to cut access any moment now that final exams are over? or not until, say, the final grading deadline, or some point in time past then? (mostly curious as to how much longer there is to download everything from Terpware that I haven't yet. i mean, even after you graduate you can keep using all that MS software *legally*! the Adobe stuff expires though.) Also, other stuff: how long are you given access to your Terpmail address after you graduate? (Chances are it's completely wrong, but I recall hearing something along the lines of 1 year.) If someone *hypothetically* wanted to continue using their ID card to occasionally ride the Shuttle buses into perpetuity (or until they redesign the card), would they probably be fine doing so? thanks folks! <eos> \n",

It was literally the post-lab questions and calculations and a few other questions, except it was closed book (whereas anyone who took the lab on time would have been able to use their notes/book/internet).

            "<bos> Hey! My friend is in a class where they use clicker questions regularly apparently the professor sent out an email to the class saying cheating in other classes has been happening and it wont be accepted. My friend logged into the clicker questions and answered from outside of class but apparently the professor told the whole class not to answer the question so he can see who was submitting from elsewhere. My friend didn't get text from anyone just login in to see if there are clickers. But he is now scared that the professor knows he answered from outside of class that is he going to get in trouble. How big of a deal is this? Would this be a violation of the student code of conduct? What are possible repercussion of this? <eos> \n",

Heres a link to the house: [url link] Currently a junior CS major. (Don't worry. I'm normal.) I am meticulously clean. Other potential housemates would be upperclassmen CMNS majors. The rent for the bedrooms with a private bath would be ~600, for the bedrooms with a shared bathroom, rent would be ~575. Utilities range from 50-80 a month. Lease is either for 10 months or 1 year. Place comes partially furnished, (beds, dressers, desks). Flexible move in date once lease is signed. Huge back yard, really quiet neighborhood. Landlords were incredibly nice and accommodating.  Edit- Rooms cannot be shared! I'm pretty sure there is an ordnance that prohibits sharing of rooms in single family homes unless those sharing the room are family members. <eos> \n",

I looked on the resident life website and saw that the max. price would be around $8000 for 2016-2017 academic year.

But the price is significantly higher for an apartment. And I'm also an out of state student. So is it worth getting an apartment in terms of cost and money? Mainly because I want to be able to cook by myself. Will I be saving money by not enrolling in the dining plan and going for an apartment or will it not make a difference?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey Terps,  Since I moved into Commons, the upstairs neighbor has been super loud between 4 AM and 10 AM, and I've been waking up multiple times between those times. I'm 100% sure it is a dog because the sound is extremely erratic. Plus, you know how dogs do that thing where they kinda just run around a room when they're bored? It sounds exactly like that. It's definitely not footsteps or anything. I can even occasionally hear the dudes voice and his acoustic guitar, but that's not an issue for me as much as the dog is. It's almost exclusively above my room or the living room, but it occasionally (about once a week) wakes my roommates up as well. I've been dealing with this all semester.   In SCC we also have RAs, and I've asked the RA's to deal with this multiple times and nothing came out of it. The first time the upper floor RA said there was no dog, but also that there were no registered service/support dogs on that floor. One of the times I woke up at 7 AM because of it, I went and woke up the RA on my floor to see it himself. He came to my room and heard it (and admitted it was super loud and unpleasant) and then went upstairs and apparently didn't find anything. I think this is because they hid the dog in someone's room because right after I got a text from the RA, my roommate woke up and started complaining about the \"dog\".   I think it's the guy above me's girlfriend's dog because it's actually not here all the time, just about half the time. I can also occasionally hear a woman's voice upstairs, and that makes it so much harder to catch.   Terps, what do I do? I want to handle this in a reasonable and mature way but I also really, truly, from the bottom of my heart just want to sleep uninterrupted by a dog of all things. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey I'm posting on here as kind of a last resort to hear from current students or other transfers. Basically I'm trying my hardest to get on campus housing for this upcoming fall semester but the person on the phone told me that I'm in position 103 (iirc).  What are the chances that I will be able to get on campus housing? Is there any other redditors out there that do have on campus housing (without a roommate) that want to talk and maybe we can work something out (I'm a guy)? I tried looking at the view/varsity but I didn't really know what I was looking for and I'm not sure if I should bother with this yet because I don't want to be locked down into off campus housing just in case I do get on campus housing. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a student who was dismissed a long time ago after a year of F's. I've returned this semester after graduating from MC (Associates) with 3.9~ and spending a semester at another univ (4.0).  My academic past haunts me here. Having already attended means that I cannot access the vast majority of scholarships/grants (that I've found thus far), and having a crap GPA from years ago essentially blocks me from getting any other UMD based help that I might otherwise be able to apply for.  Do you know what I should do? I'm currently ~$2K short for the Feb 20 deadline and it looks like my only option is to cancel my dinning plan and go off whatever money I have for food for the rest of the semester.  NB: I have Financial aid help/Loans, cannot get private loans (EU citizen - would need a cosigner *over my dead body*), and have already contacted my two departments who have limited funds (and I'm obviously not a very competitive candidate). I've been linked to a ton of private grant/scholarship websites, but fallen short of finding help thus far. I'm also in the WW process, and have strong evidence to back my claims, but that process takes time and won't help in the next 9 days).  Love you all~ <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Alright this is getting sort of ridiculous, after 6 days, the final exams still aren't graded? This is kind of pathetic. Who else is salty about how long this is taking? EDIT: Grades are up, got a high 80 lolololol godlike curve. Average was high 90's (out of 150), SD was 20. So honestly you didn't have to do very well to get a C or higher on this thing. Good luck guys, and have a nice break. <eos> \n",

The Diner never really has either one, though. I've probably seen each thing in there once over the past three weeks. My dorm is on North Campus, which means that I go to the Diner a lot (I only go to South I think twice per week since it's closer between classes than going back to North). I've been on the website and know that (certain) uncommon food is in different places a lot of the time, but if there are any patterns as to how they schedule food at different places, that knowledge would be appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Programming is very challenging for me so I’m hoping to be able to get some professors that’ll be able to explain well and are good at one on one lessons if I need any extra help.  <eos> \n",

All my final grades are in but both my unofficial transcript and \"grades\" on testudo show 0.0.

            "<bos> I took BC calc my senior year and bullshitted my way through class and the exam, which resulted in me getting a 4, which is apparently(?) enough to get me out of 141. I didn't know my score at the time of registering though and thought that taking 141 would be necessary, since I don't consider myself that strong in math (even as an engineering major). I've heard 141 is horrible though and as a freshman, I'm somewhat terrified and want to do decent the first semester. Is there a major difference between 141 and 141H? Should I try to drop 141/H entirely and use my credit or go through with it? <eos> \n",

I'll be getting my associates this semester, but after realizing a course isn't going to transfer I am realizing I need to transfer ASAP rather than next year. If I don't get into the Spring semester it'll dramatically change my plan ... shout out community college advising -\\_\\_\\_-  I have a solid 3.5 GPA and tons of extracurriculars, 4 letters of rec., and am already involved in a few UMD club/organizations.. The idea of not getting accepted when I'm already involved and taking a class is strange to me but the advisors told me my chances are slim since I missed priority deadline (I wasn't planning on transferring until next year).. sos!

I got a D+ in a course that is a prereq for a course I need to take this semester in order to graduate on time. I got sick at the tailend of the semester and didn't do well on the final. Will I be autodropped even though I technically passed (I got credit for the course) but not really? I know some courses on Testudo say you need a B-/C-/certain grade in the prereq in order to take the course, but the course I'm taking now doesn't say that. The course I'm taking is PHYS260/261 and I got a D+ in MATH141 (I'm retaking it this semester). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, so I'm a bit torn (read: lost) when it comes to choosing my major. I came into college thinking that I would eventually just declare English as a major, but I realized that I actually hate reading (I only really like writing) and that the major is notorious for churning out jobless grads/teachers so I figured I should stay away. I've gone through many phases of majors that I would declare, anthropology, french, art, film studies even (I know, I know, I like majors with no job prospects apparently :P), but I don't feel 100% about any of them. I love art, but I know that I can't just major in art (or at least I don't want to), so ideally I want a major that my art interest/skills can be an asset to. Recently I've been thinking about something along the lines of Comm (the PR track) or Journalism (Multimedia) because I feel like I might be able to blend my love of art with them and still seem marketable in the job world (maybe work at some sort of art place doing PR work or a magazine). Anyway -- my question is to anyone who has any experience with either of these majors, what do you think I should go for? What are the big differences in job prospects/curriculum/schools in general? For context, I'm only a freshman now but I'd like to make a decision sooner rather than later because I've run out of GenEds to take... Thank you! TL;DR: Which major is better for someone who enjoys art and writing? <eos> \n",

Already halfheartedly wrapped  boxed, so you know what that means! **FREE BUBBLE WRAP**. The only caveat is that you gotta come pick it up. (Don't worry, it's on campus). These things have never been used. First come first serve. **Edit:** PM me if interested. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just as background, I'm currently a junior in HS, and am really interested in math and computer-y things. Maryland looks really appealing to me because of the strength of the CS/CE programs together with the honors math program, especially the 340/341 sequence, which seems to be unique (in having a theory-oriented, starting-at-calc-3 class aimed at freshman) among schools of this caliber (that I can feasibly get into/afford; I only looked into the math programs of schools I'm already considering.). By the start of college, I should have credits for calc 1-3 and physics 1-2. I would double major in CS and math, but I'm interested in the hardware I would get from CE. I don't really have a good sense of the sheer amount of work I'm hoping to inflict upon myself (especially considering I want to do the honors math thing), but I wouldn't mind taking more than 4 years to finish. The spaces I would get from completing the general engineering requirements in HS would make the course work, at least in the first two years, actually doable (I think):  If I were to major in CE/Math ([url link] and [url link] Semester 1: Replace calc 1 with math 340 Semester 2: Replace calc 2 with 341 and take 463 where I would've taken physics Semester 3: Replace diff. eqs with 410; maybe take a gen ed Semester 4: Take 411 as the category A; replace gen ed with 405. Die.  At the end of semester 4, strictly in terms of CS classes, I'd only be a semester behind CS majors (missing Organization of Programming Languages and Algorithms), so if it were really terrible, I could switch to CS. How crazy am I? Is that a terrible idea? Will I have a life? <eos> \n",

Rent is about 960, which might be a little cheaper since it's from earlier, and my roommate is really sweet, clean and friendly. She's also cool with just about everything from friends to rowdiness.

Other people I have talked to who are also in senior standing registered yesterday or today. A class I want to take that has 40 seats already has 36 people signed up. Kinda frustrating not being able (or probably) to get into an elective for the final semester, already having senior standing. Edit- aaaand while typing this, it now has a waitlist lol. <eos> \n",

I have a couple classes in the afternoon and don't want to rush all the way back to my apartment and to my class. 3) Is a driver's license considered a valid ID? 4) Is there a clock in the examination room so that I can keep track of the time? 5) How many students are there usually per exam?

I'm transferring to UMD for the fall semester and submitted a housing request, but I've been told by a lot of people that I have a pretty shit chance of getting a dorm.

I can finish on time if I don't get a minor, but if I were to get a minor I would try to get it in public policy/ leadership or I've been recommended law and society to compliment the political science degree.

My roommate drinks a shit ton and keeps alcohol in my fridge and keeps a shit ton of empty bottles along the shelf in his closet. I am already on disciplinary probation from something last year that had nothing to do with alcohol. I've already expressed this to my roommate, telling him to get the alcohol out of the room, but he seems to have forgotten our talk. I'm not ready to get fucked over because my roommate drinks in our room. What are the chances that, if they find alcohol in the room while we are gone, we will be punished? Do they do this?  EDIT: I was clearly told that I must be on my absolute BEST behavior while on probation, no rule breaking. If I get in trouble for something, I fear the worst (suspension, expulsion). On top of my disciplinary probation, I am on housing probation. <eos> \n",

I'd prefer to get a single on campus so I don't have to deal with living in an apartment with others, but I don't have enough references to be an RA (I never talked to my freshman teachers). Is getting a single (regardless of dorm) realistic for next year or should I accept that I'll have to live in an apartment with others? Edit: I'm in University Honors [url link] Does the link above mean I'd have one of the first choices or are my chances still bad? <eos> \n",

Because Vector marketing knows that everybody knows their name is synonymous with bullshit. Don't take my word for it, look them up if you're skeptical. <eos> \n",

The club refuses to help the situation after claiming several times that they intended to so I need to take outside action. I can't find anything on either website but I was wondering if the Student Organization Resource Center or the SGA (which they receive money from) or some other department have a process for settling disputes or if I'm going to have to sue them in PG County small claims court. If anyone has any experience with a situation like this, any advice would be awesome <eos> \n",

To mitigate the effect of these factors; sometimes the best option is to willingly take a class that can be \"gamed\" -- that is to say the percentage of A's as final grades is disproportionately high, relatively speaking. The goal of this thread is to provide a comprehensive guide to the classes at UMD that fall into this category. Give  take experiences below! <eos> \n",

My company, [Paycom]([url link] is looking to hire a Transition Specialist Representative (TSR) for the Baltimore office. I personally really enjoy the job, so I figured I'd try to pay it forward for any recent grads that are still looking for job.     **What the hell is a TSR?** Basically, I help clients move all their data from their old HR and payroll provider (e.g. ADP) to Paycom. So it's a healthy amount of working on a computer as well as meeting and talking to clients. **Will I have to do ANY cold calling and/or selling?** NONE WHATSOEVER. I essentially start working AFTER the sales reps close a deal. They do all that shit. **What are the hours like?** Honestly, it's a little rough. You often work over 8 hours every day and there's very little in terms of paid leave. And since you're salary, you don't get overtime. This is definitely NOT for anyone who wants a chill job. **You mention \"salary\", what's the pay bruh?** Base is $46k, but with extra earnings and commission it gets to around $54k-$55k **Why are you posting here?** Long story short, I struggled finding a job after graduating as many recent grads do. When I heard that we were hiring, I wanted to help any way that I could. I don't know anyone job-hunting in Baltimore, so I figured I'd give anyone here the first crack at it. ___________________________________________________ Please PM me if you have any additional questions or you want to call me a bundle of sticks for spamming. Go Terps! <eos> \n",

Whats more, another TA came in halfway through with a goddamn baby on a stroller and everyone started cooing, and the proctors did not care to quiet down the classroom.  This is hardly fair as I know other sections took the same exam in other buildings with better conditions. Is there any place I can report this to or to apply for a makeup?  <eos> \n",

Is moving my car for events gonna be a pain in the ass? What should I choose?  Thanks edit: Well, decision's been made, it's lot 11. Thanks guys. <eos> \n",

So, u/MetroDZS... 1) How does it feel to know that your post is lowering the IQ of innocent redditors all over the world? 2) Will your lawsuit include a “thank you” to the EMTs who may have saved your life? 3) Is this the first time you’ve gotten so blackout drunk you couldn’t walk and then blamed your resulting idiocy on others, or is it more of a hobby for you? 4) You claim you have a video of the event. Care to provide it to us? You know, for research... 5) Do you have any other hilarious and/or meme-worthy stories to share with us?

I'm fortunate enough to have my lease extended so I'm immune to the moving woes of the season. With work slowing down in the next few weeks, I'd like to get out and active more lest I fall victim to the current Steam sales.  I do not have a car or truck so this offer is strictly for manual labor. I can be anywhere the UM Shuttle goes but I'd be willing to take Metro/Metrobus if absolutely need be. Weekends or evenings after 5:30 work best but I can be fairly flexible. If you'd like to take advantage of me (giggity) shoot me a PM here or post in the thread and we get scheduling worked out.  I'd love to offer a similar service for the Fall move-in but that's when work really starts to pick up at the bookstore. However, if our stars somehow align, I'd be happy to lend a hand as well. Keep an eye out closer to move in.  Regardless of whether you need my help, best of luck to all those who will be moving in this next month and a half!  <eos> \n",

I couldn't be happier and I just have some questions off the top. 1) is there on campus housing offered for older students? I just turned 24 and was hoping there are on campus grad student dorms I would be able to be placed in or just housing that is offered through the school to someone my age. It would certainly be easier for me to apply that to my student loan than find off campus housing to worry about. 2) so although I'm done with my first two years I know at least 50-55 of my 68ish credits will transfer I know for a fact I need General Physics I, can anyone recommend a professor? This, as well as suggestions for any general classes I could use as necessary credits towards my degree that aren't within my major Thank you guys, go terps! <eos> \n",

I am also leaning towards Cyber Security but I do not want to commit. Another factor to consider is that I was not directly admitted into Computer Science at Udub whereas in Maryland I was. Basically I want to know if Udub's Computer Science program is worth the risk as approximately only 1/3rd of the admitted students for computer science will actually be able to get into computer science.

I requested to live in the same place next year, however, all my current roommates will be living off campus/in apartments next year.

I understand that engineering is an LEP, so here are some questions I have about that: 1) If I apply as a comp sci major, how hard is it to switch to engineering if I decide that I want to study engineering instead? What is the acceptance rate for people trying to switch to engineering? 2) If I apply as an engineering major and I switch to comp sci later, is it possible for me to switch back to engineering if I change my mind again? 3) Is it possible to double major with some kind of engineering AND computer science? If I want to do that, should I apply as a CS major or an engineering major? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was at an 80. The avg was at a 77, but after dropping the lowest quiz grade and dropping some clicker quizzes, I'm guessing the average went up to an 80? I still ended up with a B-, so for those of you taking 330 next semester, do NOT expect a curve more than 2 or 3 points... Its weird.. I swear I had a higher curve in 132 going from a B+ to an A-. Our first midterm avg was a 75 and the second midterm avg was a 59. I had Anwar, who wasn't necessarily a bad teacher, but knew how to make tricky and tough questions. For people taking 330 next semester, make sure you practice a lot of coding problems, maybe look at hackerrank. They ask a lot of questions about reversing/modifying lists in Ruby, OCaml, and Prolog. Also, projects are 40% of your grade! The projects are very hard, so make sure you start early. I got mostly A's except for the first 7% project one which I got around a C+. So make sure you study just as hard for the tests as well. Practice your speed and do not expect a curve. Even if TA's or the teacher says you might get a curve more than 3 points, that means nothing as long as the class avg is borderline C+. My TA told me I'd probably have a 4 point curve, but I ended with 1-2 points and the same letter grade. Again, expect nothing and work on your programming skills. Best of luck. <eos> \n",

Basically, the PSYC Major here sucks job prospects wise unless you want to spend another \\~6 years getting a Doctorate for a chance at a job that may pay 70-80k. However, I've developed a love for Neuroscience while here. Neuroscience + Neuroengineering/technology is a big, big, interdisciplinary field with lots of angles of approach. It seems like for Brain Computer Interface and Neuroprosthetics development, Comp E. would be a good choice, as you could develop either the hardware or the software for these types of devices. Any Comp E. majors here: What are your impressions of the major?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I switched into CS this semester as a Freshman and I haven't taken CMSC131 yet. I'm taking MATH141 and CMSC131 next semester (Spring). I was wondering how difficult it would be to take all three of those classes (132, 216, 250) in the Fall of next year. I would probably learn some more Java and C over the summer on my own. Or should I just take 132 and 250 in the fall and take 216 in the spring of Sophomore year? Or should I take 132 and 250 over the summer? My advisor recommended me to take CMSC132 in the summer this year, but I might have to do something else over the summer.  **EDIT: I forgot that you can't take 132 and 216 together, so the updated question is how necessary it would be to take 132/maybe 250 over the summer rather than taking 132 and 250 in the fall and 216 in the spring.** <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was walking home about an hour ago on Yale Ave and a silver van with four guys drove past me yelling things like \"Are you on girls gone wild?\" and other obscene things. I stopped and started walking the other way. They then stopped, turned around, and followed me down the street, still yelling at me and asking me to get in their car. Luckily someone stopped and walked with me and they drove off. I called UMPD and apparently this is the latest in a string of incidents in the past two weeks. TL;DR If you're a girl, be careful walking alone near Frat Row!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a CC student in MoCo who is currently living with my mother, which is a rather difficult situation as she is not exactly the best kind of mother. I've already applied to the MTAP program, but I won't be able to transfer until spring of 2019 because I won't complete my 30 credits until june. This coming semester, I've registered for all online courses, which only require me to come into the college for midterms and finals, and if I complete 12 more credits, then I will be accepted to MTAP (assuming I keep a 3.0) However, living with my family isn't viable anymore and I do not have a significant enough source of money to live off campus or by myself, so I was planning to live with my friend, (who has a single dorm) until I get admitted to UMD or find alternative housing. What would need to be done to be able to live at the university? Would it be possible for him to get a second pass / key? I currently have a unofficial internship with one of the physics labs, how much power would the profs there have to allow me to get a meal pass / alternative housing? They mentioned being paid, but their grant for undergraduates doesn't come in until 2019. Obviously, this isn't the best situation, but I don't have many other options currently and this seems like the safest option, and any help / advice would be much appreciated.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So my current plans for the summer and fall semester are to take 132 over the summer while working nearby, then 216 and 250 in the fall with fridays off and easy gen eds to pair it will. Unfortunately the calc 2 final was nothing like the practice tests and kinda fucked me up, I have about 6% wiggle room so who knows I may be ok. I emailed the CS advisor but she said that 141 is non transferable, while I thought it was and my research backs that. Is there any reason why she would say that? Should I ask another advisor? Thoughts? <eos> \n",

I'm only falling behind in 2 classes (one being math, which I can probably bring up) and CLAS170. I want to drop CLAS170 because it's not related to my major and I feel like the extra work from that class is making me lag in my other classes. Does anyone know if it's too late to drop a class? And also what would a 'W' look like on my transcript to future employers? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey Reddit Maryland: Not positive this is the correct place to post (and hope this isn't a breach of rule 3), but my team told me that there are quite a few start up types on Reddit. So I have a Startup with the goal of disrupting Alcohol, specifically for colleges (starting with the Big 10).  The product is Kava tea, native to Fiji and Vanuatu where they drink it in place of Alcohol (because its effects feel similar). We believe, with some little adjustments, Kava tea can become a viable competitor.  Since, volume typically have been best face to face, we're looking for current students to act as kind of “Brand reps”. Actual sales have migrated to Amazon. However, since we aren’t physically here, we don’t know the best way to reach out. Is there a good way to find entrepreneurial students at Maryland? (Looking for the rest of the Big 10 as well).  And for a bit more context – Everyone currently involved is either in Penn State or graduated there.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Ok, so long story short. I am a CS major and registered for two CMSC courses this summer, and I messed it up badly, due to multiple stupid reasons. I have tried to filed for petition to drop the courses but got denied. Thus, my gpa is bound to fall under 2.0 when the summer session ends. Will that put me under academic probation? I just checked the school policies and it said students will be put on academic probation when \"semester gpa\" falls under 2.0, and I am not sure whether it applies to summer session as well or not. Will I be on probation as soon as the summer session ends, or only if my gpa is still under 2.0 when the fall semester ends? Can anyone provide some input? Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm studying in Arizona for this semester and through some miscommunication I lost my room in College Park for when I return. Does anyone here know of a room that will be open for spring semester (specifically, Jan - May)? Sublet or short-term lease. I won't put any preferences or prices here, to gather a larger option pool. I'm also checking on OCH and Craigslist. I am a senior, 22 years old. I intend on being a part-time student with a job and / or internship for next semester. I do not smoke cigarettes, but I do enjoy drinking. I cook for myself, have close friends, but generally stay in my room or the kitchen when not doing anything else. I'm active on campus (Terrapin Trail Club, multiple service organizations), and in some off-campus organizations (ECO City Farms, local park service). I can party well, but also appreciate quiet nights. I've dumpstered in the past and will probably go with my friends who are still going. I bike to school, and will most likely have a car. I am a pretty active person all around; I backpack and hike, exercise daily (cross training, run, bike, walk), and practice yoga. **Edit for personal information** <eos> \n",

I've seen what 131 has been doing so far, I understand how to do projects, but I never learned the conceptual stuff they've been learning.  2) I placed out of 141, and I think I'm supposed to take linear algebra or multivariable calc next semester. I don't really remember the calc I did last year, so I was thinking about linear, but my friend tells me I should take multi. Any suggestions? 3) Are there any classes that teach web design/making? HTML, CSS JS? 4) I've always been interested in UI/UX. Any classes for that? <eos> \n",

I'm a Michigan State fan visiting for the football game this Saturday and was hoping to get some tips to make the best of the experience. - What are the best options for parking? I found [this parking map]([url link] that has a few options for pre-pay parking at $17, but the site also mentioned that parking on campus, at meters, and at the metro station are free. Is it possible to find decent free parking or is the pre-pay the way to go? If so, does it matter much which lot I select? - Do a lot of people tailgate in the pre-pay lots? Are there other major areas for tailgating? Do the bars around campus get pretty packed during pre-game? What are good bars to visit if we want to hang out, and maybe catch some of the earlier games in the day? - Any suggestions for anything on or around campus worth seeing while we're in town? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For the longest time, I'd been meaning to go to the Counseling Center to discuss a number of things. After about 2.5 years, I finally mustered the courage to make an appointment a few months ago. It turned out to be a really terrible experience - the intake counselor was very cold, interrupted me numerous times, and at two different points during the meeting he ACTUALLY said \"You know, I don't really see a problem here. I'm not sure what you came in for/why you're here\". Sure, my problems are not as heavy as others (it's all relative), but it still really, really hurt to hear that. I got a weird vibe from him early on so I didn't delve deep into the topics I wanted to discuss. There are some other things that he also said that I did not appreciate and made me feel worse, but I won't discuss them now.  At the end of the appointment we was trying to pressure me into deciding how to continue; whether I wanted to do group therapy (which we kept pushing) or if I wanted to see a psychologist. I ended up leaving without making a decision, primarily because I was so turned off by the intake meeting and the counselor.  I'm here to ask my fellow Terps what they suggest. I've tried the Help Center and they're really fantastic, although I've found that they listen more than they give advice, and I really need some guidance and advice. Such I give the Counseling Center another go? Do you have a therapist you'd suggest? Help a fellow Terp out. <eos> \n",

My notes were comparable to Titanic artifacts as to how drenched and unreadable they were. I did have an umbrella but that did no good as the wind was blowing the droplets of rain in all directions in a spontaneous fashion. I hope to not endure such tragedy ever again, either this semester or in the foreseeable future. <eos> \n",

Since I don't have an helmet, I generally ride on footpaths to be on the safer side. Is it okay to do that? I see a lot of groaning in this sub for riding on footpath.  Also, are bicycles considered pedestrians or as vehicles? I am asking this because I was at the zebra crossing near the m-circle on a bicycle and a car hit me as I was crossing. I don't know whether it was my fault or the dude's. If bicycles are considered pedestrian, then it was definitely his fault. But if they are considered as vehicles, then maybe I am at fault. Any concrete rules exist for bicycle riding at UMD? <eos> \n",

Let's say a student is a due-paying member of the KKK, but is really nice and civil to anyone on campus and never actually has any negative incidents on campus, or any crimes off campus. They're just a member. They haven't gotten arrested, been identified at events, or anything like that. They're just a due-paying member. So could a student technically get kicked off campus or out of housing just for being a member, even if they haven't actually broken any rules? We're just curious, and had a debate about this. Technically, it could be considered joining any other activist party, right? Totally random, and completely theoretical. None of us actually want to join the Klan, I promise! But really, could they? We think so, but at the same time, maybe technically not. <eos> \n",

Does anyone have experience attending UMD as a post-bacc/second degree student and if so can you share your experience?  Based on what I've heard from the CS advisor and Admission Office, I would likely have to apply as a transfer student after attending CC. What are some of the classes that I should take at CC for a smooth transfer? I understand you should try to take as many math courses as you can but also heard the CS courses won't transfer over. <eos> \n",

As such, I'm leaning towards buying only the first book or two that we read and buying the rest as the class progresses.   Knowing all of this, does anyone remember the order that the books are covered in the course? I'm taking the course with Francisco Barrenechea, if that helps. If you don't remember what the books are, the list is as follows:  - *Essential Homer* (Homer) - *Medea, Hippolytes, Heracles, Bacchae* (Euripedes) - *Anthology of Classical Myth* (Trzaskoma) - *Classical Mythology: Very Short Intro* (Morales) - *Metamorphoses* (Ovid) - *Sophocles I* (Sophocles)  <eos> \n",

However, there was no information on when the actual decisions etc is released. If commons doesn't work out would I find out in time to still be able to apply for regular housing, which I can't do now since that is a binding agreement.  In general, how hard is it to get into Commons, if I applied for priority leasing and am in good standing and everything.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey there!  I'm sort of getting myself prepared to transfer to UMD for the Fall 2017 semester. I want to know how likely it is that I can get into the A James Clark upon initial transfer. I've already taken all of the gateway courses (and passed the requirements) and my GPA is currently 3.6, but could fluctuate either up or down depending on the next two semesters (although I am currently 70+ credits into the community college so it really can't move TOO much). I just finished Calc III with a C, which is the first C I have ever gotten...I'm wondering if it's worth my time to retake it or should I just continue forward and take the C.  Thanks, in advance, for any input.  <eos> \n",

Some backstory is that I have lived in College Park all my life and have wanted to go further, but UMD is just such a good school for my major and in-state tuition is very affordable. Anyways, here they are.  1. How is the Information Systems Program? How are the professors? Curriculum? Reputation? Difficulty? Overall Experience? 2. How is the Government and Politics major? Professors? Difficulty? Planning to do a double major. 3. What is there to do besides drinking? I'm asking what do y'all like to do in your free time and what activities does the University sponsor? 3. How are the dorms, food, etc? 4. What are the people like? What are the girls like (Had to ask-sorry) 5. What are the biggest pros and cons to UMD? 6. How do you double majors?  <eos> \n",

Im also looking at rpi which also has great rankings, lehigh, which im not sure i like yet, and stevens since its close and also a good program. any info on difficulty to get in and physics itself is appreciated. thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

The room I was put into requires bunked beds. Has anyone here lived in Calvert before? Or in a room needing bunked beds? I feel like you can just loft both beds and make space that way, but what are your thoughts? Also, if anyone has photos of a double needing bunked beds, that would be great. Can't find any photos anywhere. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've just finished my first year as a computer science major at my local no-name state university, and as I've become more and more conscious of what it takes to succeed in my future career I've been considering transferring schools.  I really only decided to enroll here because it was cheap (using the GI Bill for in-state tuition, I'm actually making a profit going here) and near home. However, I'm considering transferring to somewhere out of state with a more prestigious CS program like University of Maryland. However, some of the things I'm concerned about are: * Difficulty of school: I finished my first year fairly well at a 3.5 GPA and thought my courses were on the easier side, but I'm worried if I transfer to somewhere with a more rigorous program I won't be able to keep up. * Cost: Out of state tuition is insane, and I'm afraid the GI Bill won't be able to cover it- I'm avoiding student loan debt like the plague. * Social life: I usually keep to myself and I'm alright with being alone, but moving away from friends and family might get to me after a while. I haven't talked to anyone about considering this, as I don't want them to think I'm leaving when I have yet to come to a decision. I know this post might just seem like I'm giving a million reasons to not transfer, but if someone could lend some advice I'd really appreciate it.  <eos> \n",

I am a freshman in the CS program here, about to enter my second semester in the Spring. During the fall in 131, I gave a friend my code to help them on the projects. He returned the favor to me throughout the semester by giving me programming advice (not actual code) on how to approach the projects. But then at the very end of the semester, he ends up having an exact copy of my coding implementation in a couple of the 131 projects (He sent me his code out to me out of fear after seeing an email about cheating from the professor). He told me that he admitted to everything to the professor via email, but I have yet to do so. I also know that he didn't mention me by name, but as of now, both of us haven't heard back from the University/Council.  What should I do now once I receive that email? Both of us are planning on coming clean 100% to everything once the Council or whatever board calls us in, but I'm not so sure what's gonna happen to me, because I didn't confess to the professor earlier. I know that this fuck-up was on me, and even though I can't self-confess or whatever at this point, what can I do when I get that XF? I'm not trying to throw my friend under the bus, and he doesn't want to neither, but we both want to try and fix our mistakes after all this blows over. Once again, I know that I am at complete fault for this, and at this point, I just want advice on what to do.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am a transfer student from the college of southern Maryland where I have completed my associate's degree in computer science. This is my first semester at UMD, I did not take any exemption exams, and I took 131,comm107,engl393, and stat400. When I spoke with a transfer advisor before deciding on UMD and received paperwork it was clear my computer science classes won't transfer which was fine. It also was mentioned that I didn't need to take any i-series, etc as it was completed with my associates, I believe. I also saw someone mention the same thing here before. However I spoke with my advisor for next semester classes, I plan to take 132 with 250 with the rest being geneds for SP, diversity, and i-series. I ran an audit too and it says that I need to complete these geneds too.        So I guess I'm just confused whether there's a problem going on. From my understanding, I didn't need to take any geneds (except professional writing and communications) because that is completed with my associates. As mentioned though, it doesn't seem that way, or it isn't properly acknowledging my associates or something. Anyone know more about this situation or have a similar experience? I plan to talk to an advisor again, but I wanted different perspectives before I go. <eos> \n",

I already have a mountain bike, but it's at my parent's house. I could ask my parent to ship it here, but I'm wondering if buying a cheap road bike would be a better overall option. Do people ride mountain bikes around campus? does it make getting around harder than a road bike or hybrid? Do mountain bikes generally fair better in the snow?  Thanks yall, let me know. <eos> \n",

I’m wondering if that will be a waste of time or alot learning new stuff. Same with Econ 200 vs Ap Micro and Math 120 vs Calc AB and Eng 101 vs Ap Lang.  I was thinking to take Eng 101 online over the summer bc I expect it to be pretty easy. But since I’m majoring in Econ and Gvpt, I def want a solid foundation in the intro courses. (gvpt 170 and econ 200) so it would be better to take the actual classes righ (instead of online)? — to get a solid foundation for the rest of my major?

            "<bos> Hey r/UMD, I'm currently a sophomore engineering student and I've had a lot of Not Good™ family problems this semester. As a result, I'm right on the failing line for a math class of mine that's required for my major. I could technically take an entire withdraw with the situation going on right now; however, I am doing pretty well in my other classes and I don't really want to lose progress. If I drop the math class I'll be at 12 credits so thats not an issue either. I suppose I'm asking for advice on how bad a W in a major required course looks. I was planning on possible grad school so would a W ruin my chances ? Would it be ok if I acknowledged and explained it? And as a side note, would it be better to stick it out and (possibly) fail rather than take a W? My GPA is relatively high so I'd rather not ruin it. Any advice is appreciated! And I can answer any questions if anyone has any. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm an incoming freshman and I just found out yesterday that I was supposed to submit the housing and dining agreement before may 1. Apparently if you submit it after may 1 you aren't guaranteed on-campus housing and you'll be considered based on how much space is left. How fucked am I? Did anyone else have this happen and have it work out fine?  Edit: Update since someone posted this on the class of 2018 Facebook group, I got an email that acknowledges that they got the housing request and it included the phrase \"now that you're confirmed for on-campus housing...\". I'm not sure if that means I'm getting housing definitely or just that I'm confirmed for wanting on campus housing though. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey, so I'll be staying in an apartment with 5 other people in Calvert Hall. It's a two floor apartment on the top floor, so it seems like a pretty sweet deal. I do have a couple questions though.  1. How are the bathrooms in the apartments, specifically the shower? 2. I saw Calvert hall underwent renovations in 2014, can anyone tell me about that? 3. What furniture comes in the common room? 4. Are RAs less strict in apartments? I ask because I plan on smoking (nothing outrageous like J's or blunts) on the top floor of the apartment.  Any answers are appreciated! <eos> \n",

The only close apartments I can find that have occupancy are The Enclave and Varsity. I'm basically looking for a comfy place that I won't be disturbed at night while trying to sleep. Not interested in a party atmosphere. I'm leaning towards the Varsity, on a side that's away from Looney's.  <eos> \n",

For those who are currently at UMD, does laptop theft occur often? Should I be worried about buying an expensive laptop? Or should I go for a cheaper alternative instead?

While it was nice being closer to my classes, the spaces are super tight. I am wondering if anyone has any experience parking in that lot in the spring with the snowfall. I am debating switching back to lot 6.  <eos> \n",

I did ok in my first quiz in linear algebra, I got 8/10 but I dont understand much of whats going on in class. Also kind of discouraged that that average was slighter higher at 8.4/10. my professor (rosca) just teaches off slides. She doesnt write anything on the board. I also dont understand 250 much right now. Truth tables I can do but the proofs are just going over my head. <eos> \n",

It's just a few minutes from College Park, and would be a good change from Jason's. It's got great food, great beer (you don't have to be 21 to go, though!) and has a nice atmosphere. Thanks to Bergiful for the heads up on why Wednesday was bad! Who's in? edit: hopefully enough people can get themselves there - post if you have a car and you're willing to bring some others! **edit: this has been postponed, pending a more community-approved event** <eos> \n",

I was surprised to find that there are no general book clubs on OrgSync. Does anybody know of any that aren't being advertised for online? Would asking a librarian at McKeldin be a good idea?

            "<bos> I have mixed feelings about it. I have many friends who came in through freshman connection, but I feel as though the university is doing a massive disservice to them but admitting people who aren't of the same calibre as regular admit students that take the same classes.  Now don't get me wrong, some of my best friends I've made in UMD have been through freshman connection, but they are the same people that are going through academic probation, getting kicked out of their major, having disciplinary problems, or even just wasting a lot of time trying to get into an LEP that won't accept them. I'm not saying that all freshman connection admits do this, but they a lot of them are struggling to keep up in classes, not to mention the stigma of getting in through freshman connection as well. Additionally, they lower the rankings of the schools. UMD is too big already tbh (40,000 students wtf); if they just cull all the freshman connection students, we'd be a higher ranked school. It's not like they wouldn't have anywhere else to go, freshman connection usually yields a UMBC or Towson admit, right? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I just transferred to UMD from a community college and I began to major in comp sci. I've never taken a comp sci class before, not in high school nor at community. My biggest goal and dream in life right now is to graduate from UMD with a comp sci degree. There are days where I'm so motivated and I'm on top of everything but there are days like today where I think to myself and say could I really do this or am I fooling myself? I'm currently starting with cmsc 131 and I'll be graduating two years late if I don't take summer or winter courses (ps would you guys recommend me taking a comp sci course during the winter or summer? Or is it too hard?) I know that if I graduate from here with this degree I would have so many great opportunities and my life would basically be set. But, the one thing is is that I'm scared. I'm not the type of learner that just looks at the board and understands the material and then goes partying that weekend. I actually have to spend hours to understand one thing and go to tutors and TA's for help. So far I've taken all my gen eds and what's left for my degree are these comp sci courses and stat 400. I keep hearing that everything just gets harder and harder with these classes, which I do expect b/c this is a very challenging major but it scares me that I might not be able to do this. Also, I keep stressing myself about the whole \"you have two 2 chances to take this course and if not you're out of the program\". Also, one thing that I do want to point out is that I really really really really want to pursue this major at UMD but I'm scared because I don't think I'm smart enough and it brings me down every time. I always wake up during midnight and i just stress myself about this. So can someone just give me some advice and any senior that was in the same situation as me?  <eos> \n",

I didn't have to pay anything this time but I forget my key in my room sometimes and go to the front desk for help, and apparently at some point I'll have to pay an exorbitant amount of money (50 dollars to BORROW a spare key for less than an hour?) in order to use this basic service. I mean what does it take, one minute of the person at the front desk's time that they would have spent doing homework anyways? Don't normally rage about stuff like this but I thought I may as well go for it, this is just outrageously stupid. What do you guys think, am I in the wrong here for being forgetful or is SCC just scumming people out of money due to their carelessness? <eos> \n",

There is a Toyota car key, some house keys, and my Courtyards apartment keys on them. If not, does anyone know some of the locations for lost and founds?

All the transfer students l know of are commuters. Then, the rest l know are freshmen and sophomores. For the reference: I’m 24 and male. I’m usually surrounded by people 4-5 years younger than me.

It’d be good to have a meet up with nearby older students who still want to enjoy the college lifestyle while it lasts. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> i was sitting confused in my cmsc411 classroom yesterday, when i heard a gentle rumbling of tides crashing onto a beach. at first i thought it was a phantom noise from my imagination, piqued by unusually warm february weather. upon closer examination, i realized the sounds were really there. there was a mix of the noise of static and the shore mixed together, softly emitting from the speakers, playing in the background of my professors voice. is anybody else hearing white noise playing in select classrooms in csic? <eos> \n",

For example should I order the room preferences as: specific room on floor 7 in oakland, floor 7 in oakland, oakland. Or should I do it the other way around? Should I put oakland first to make sure I get it, then floor 7, then the specific room? Thanks! <eos> \n",

Since orientation I have had to take my pants down to my knees and whip my penis and testicles out every time I go to eat, and it has just become super inconvenient at this point. Yea I liked the laugh I'd get at the beginning but at some point the joke just got old, and now I just hold people up in line. My sex game has improved tremendously as of late, having exposed my immensely large cock to a great many bitches and hoes but it's still not worth the time cost of taking my pants near off every time I want a cookie. Where do I go to change the swipe? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> SELLING: High-quality Record Player This beautiful turntable has been gathering metaphorical dust. She deserves to be cherished by a music lover. I bought her two years ago with the intention of building a vinyl collection and listening to her every day, but alas she is still as chaste as the day she left the box (which I still have!) Be warned: This isn't your average Urban Outfitters Crosley suitcase record player. This all-analog record player was handcrafted in Woodburn, MA by people whose philosophy is high quality listening at an affordable price. She is simple, elegant, and needs someone better than me. Whether you're looking to enter the world of vinyl or a seasoned audiophile, this turntable wants your love. Includes the following:  * U-Turn Orbit Basic ([url link] with a pre-installed Audio Technica AT91B cartridge ($179) * Cue lever ($40) * Acrylic Platter ($90) Asking $250 for everything, valued at $310. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Because my summer 132 teacher kinda screwed me over in terms of getting the grades up on testudo, I accidentally dropped 216 and 250 (for which I was already in) and after asking for permission from the undergrad office, I'm back in 216 (with, I've heard bad things about, Herman) and on the waitlist for 250 (with Jason Filippou, the waitlist on schedule of classes says there's 2 on the waitlist for the section I'm trying to get back in, and the waitlist check says I'm third for that section's waitlist???). I've noticed there are about 3 or 4 spaces left for 250H and that Goldstein is an awesome teacher. What should I do (and i need an answer quickly because my mom was an emotional wreck all day yesterday and most of today because of this) Edit: also, CMSC250H isn't restricted to just the honors program right? Edit 2: I feel like i haven't included enough information due to me searching, but my cumulative GPA is barely enough to keep in college, so I have no chances in taking 250H, right? <eos> \n",

I am from the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign and know a lot of college students will charge very low prices for their apartments (ie. $700 for the whole summer) so I was interested in finding a student property like this for cheap. I have looked at umd.uloop.com/housing which has a lot of great apartments, but not many summer sublets.

However some people have told me that in order to pass this class, I must get an A as it will take the average of the two times i took the class and therefore give me a passing grade of C as my final grade. Is this really true? I've looked up the repeat policy for UMD and see no mention of this. Also i'm not a freshman so freshman forgiveness wont apply. I can most definetly get a B or C for this course but an A is very hard and so I'm wondering that if i'm not acing this course should I drop it and take it again later? <eos> \n",

The 12-0-1 (5-0-0 ACC) Terps, who are the second-best scoring offense in the country, are hosting the 11-1-1 (4-0-1) Tar Heels, who sport the nation's best scoring defense. This game will not only determine who has the upper hand in the conference as the season winds down, but also heading into conference and national tournament play. We packed just under 8,000 fans in against Duke last year; let's jump that number this year.  Come to the game. Be loud. Support the Terps. Vamos Maryland. <eos> \n",

I'm a freshman here at UMD in LTSC but wanting to transfer to Aerospace Engineering and also AFROTC, so my GPA needs to stay above a certain point (3.0?) as well as adding a class. I was originally put in MATH140 (without AP scores, my Calc AB subscore came in after the orientation date and I ended up getting a 4 in AB/3 in BC) but transferred to 141 the day after classes started with an open spot in Hamilton's class- my ROTC schedule requirements prohibited me from changing my schedule much, and his class was the only one that fit. We took the diagnostic test and I'm 99% certain I got a 1 (maybe 3) out of 20 looking at the crocodile hunter's emailed solution due to the algebra tricks involved. I knew the calculus (except for some strange thing I did with u-sub but I understand now) but made algebra errors that resulted in this score. I don't feel like going back to 140 would help me any- again, the calculus parts are fine for me- and the 140 classes that fit in my schedule are full (and again, I don't feel like it would help). My current strategy is to continue in 141 and if the worst happens I'm allowed to retake 1 gateway class according to the Clark website so try it next semester (although work my butt off to get a B or higher this semester). My current courseload is MATH141, COMM107, ENGL101, CHEM131 (134 next semester)and ARSC100/059. Does anyone have any thoughts? I'm feeling really demoralized after getting literally the worst grade I've ever gotten on anything on stuff I did in 11th grade and dating back to 6th grade. <eos> \n",

I will have guaranteed on campus housing by the way.  Will I be treated differently by students and faculty or should I just pick another school? (Maryland was one of my tops). I don't feel like toughing it out for a semester if I will not be having fun and if it is inconvenient.  *Sorry I meant to put 2016* <eos> \n",

I am a transfer student from Howard Community College for the upcoming fall semester and I plan on doing an internal transfer into the Clark School of Engineering in the spring. I plan on having most of my gateway classes finished up this fall, expect one. Which is where my problem stems from. I need to take ENES100 in fall in order to meet the requirement for the Clark School, but while registering for the fall semester during orientation, it wouldn't grant me access to register for some reason. I think It requires permission from the Engineering department for me to move forward with registration. So how do I go about asking for permission ?

            "<bos> Hi! I was admitted to the college of Letters and Sciences for Fall 2014. I know that I have to meet the gateway requirements and then just apply and(atleast from what I understand) am guaranteed acceptance into Engineering. I just had a few questions though: * Do students who take this route still need to undergo the 45-credit review that the umd website says direct admits must do? * I'm not sure how quickly I can get into engineering. I am going to try to get an AP credit for Calc I and *possibly* Calc II/MATH141. (I already have credits for the English\\Social studies requirements.) This means that I will have at max, PHYS161, CHEM135, and MATH141 to take in order to get accepted into engineering. **My question is, how far will this put me behind with respect to Aerospace courses?** I checked briefly online and saw that Freshmen take 7 hours of Engineering courses..that's pretty far behind :( I'm coming from pretty far out of state(No aerospace majors\\schools I enjoy in Louisiana) and it's rather expensive so I REALLY want to avoid adding an extra year.

Tabletop games like Magic, DD, etc are good too. On a semi-related note, does anyone know if there will be an anime club this year? The president of the club last year told me that she didn't know if there would be enough people to start it up again, or something to that effect. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I have already figured out how much I will be getting based on my credit load for this semester. I would like to know, if anyone had a similar experience, how long would it take for the partial aid amount to be posted on my student account? I was told it would be done sometime after the schedule adjustment has ended, but feels a bit odd to wait a bit longer. Any thoughts? <eos> \n",

If I go to Starbucks, use LTE on my phone, or go on literally any other internet connection I can access the sites with no problem. Otherwise, the login hangs and the connection times out. This happens with multiple WP installs on different servers. I've tried logging in on friends' computers, clearing my cache/cookies, deleting plugins, using the ethernet connection... all to no avail. Calling OIT didn't help. Anyone having a similar problem, or find a way to fix it? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> If you don't mind me asking, of course. I really can't stand Maryland's system in which class percentage dictates whether or not you graduate with honors. It's not that it's a terrible means of judging - it's just most universities go by a set GPA threshold (e.g., 3.8 is magna cum laude). The reason I'm asking this is because I graduate this semester, and while my GPA is fairly high, I'm not sure if I'll be able to graduate with honors. I guess I need too depend on my colleagues to do poorly relative to myself. So for those of you who did graduate with honors, what did it take to do so? <eos> \n",

We ordered some stuff, but it's not going to get here in time for when we need to film over the next couple of days. We managed to find a Trump wig, but we don't have a wig that looks like either Bernie's balding head or Hillary's 'do. So I'm reaching out to ya'all: does anyone have a wig that looks like either Bernie's hair or Hillary's hair that wouldn't mind loaning it to me to film my video? I only need it for a few days, and I promise I'll take good care of it! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I just finished my second semester as a junior at umd and I just found out that I am going to be on academic probation. It is super dishearting for me because I worked so hard to get to this school and I just keep messing things up. And to make matters worse, I have a 1.996. I am in the LEP program and I am not looking forward to changing my major after all of this work I have put in..I failed a stupid Gen Ed class and it screwed me over. But in my major classes, I am passing. Do you guys think I have a chance of repealing a dismissal from my major? I understand that I should have worked harder and this is a rude awaking for me. I just feel like a complete failure and all hope is lost at this point. Any suggestions are welcome <eos> \n",

            "<bos> * I'm currently a freshmen living in the varsity and this year has been absolutely unbearable for me. I believe that part of this could be attributed to getting extremely unlucky and getting 3 very terrible random roommates. I try my absolute best to socialize with people in my classes and outside of this building but it seems like all my effort always goes to waste. I had living arrangements worked out for next year but due to some circumstances I'm not quite sure if that is going to work out anymore. Instead of playing the luck of the draw I want to actually try and find people who I could actually live with. So my question I have is there some sort of website or program that helps with finding roommates based off different interests and stuff like that? <eos> \n",

This is the first time I've been unable to sleep for 2 days in the same week. Usually it's just Sunday night that I stay up the whole time.The problem is I have loads of CS projects to do and I can't be in a sleepy when doing them. I decided to get up right now and start doing them. What should I do? <eos> \n",

This is a problem because there's really no testing the waters for this decision; I'd basically need to jump right in with what I've heard is an insanely hard class. I'll definitely talk to an advisor before I sign up for classes, but I just wanted to get a preliminary opinion first! How much will I hate myself if I take CHEM 231 next semester? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Dear /r/UMD, I guess when normal people go to college, they meet people in their dorms and classes and stuff like that. Meeting people in my dorm never happened freshman year because there was this weird expectation that I was supposed to hang out with other girls which doesn't work for me. And I kind of hide in all my classes.  So I met people through a video game I used to play competitively: In The Groove (similar to DDR). Stamp used to have this awesome dedicab (basically really good hardware to play the game on). I played it a lot and we had tournaments and stuff. I made some really close friends on campus. They were all older than me. And then they got rid of the machine for a really crappy upgrade cab so I stopped meeting people that way. And then they all graduated. And today is the first day that I officially don't feel like I know anybody on this campus again. So if you were a Junior and had three semesters left and all of your close friends graduated and moved really far away, what would you do? I have a pretty narrow range of interests. I'm a math  CS double major, I like music and puzzle video games and I run a lot. I also like food. That's about it. Occasionally I pick up new interests, like recently I've gotten into Dominion and nethack. I've tried to join some clubs here, but I got super bored and stopped showing up. And so I turn to Reddit, which I guess is what any lost nerd would do. Any ideas? Love, Talia <eos> \n",

I just realized it's not the card I had intended to purchase, and so I'm hoping to sell it for a slight discount from the retail value online rather than go through the returns process.

Attendees will be able to try out incredible AR  VR experiences on headsets, like the Microsoft HoloLens, Oculus Rift, HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset, etc., and on mobile devices, like the iPhone X and the Pixel 2. We'll also have workshops to teach you about the development tools that you can use to build your own AR/VR applications. On the final day, there will be a fast-paced mini-hackathon competition where you can bring your ideas to life. **All majors are welcomed and no prior AR/VR or coding experience is required.** If you want to further your AR/VR development skills, are interested in finding out what exactly AR/VR is all about, or are just looking for something cool to do for a weekend, make sure to sign up for the event!  *Tldr; Come to RealityHacks' Weekend of AR  VR, October 20  21, CSIC Building, details and registration in link below.*  [[url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey umd reddit. long time no see. I have two questions, gonna ask the natural sciences one first because it's more important. I'm taking GEOL100 right now for my natural sciences lab. It was a bit overwhelming at first (because the HW is awfully programmed and tends to be a bit too in-depth compared to the exams) but I've gotten the hang of it. It's basically impossible for me to not get credit for that now. I was wondering what classes people would recommend for natural science credit (no lab) for this fall. I used to be a CS major so I'm stuck here kind of late and want to finish up, so I'm just trying to get that last GenEd in... Secondly, does anyone know what's up with art classes? I don't remember it being like this before, but I guess I just wasn't paying attention. But basically, every upper level art and art history class that ISN'T one of the required \"intermediate courses\" is on tues/thurs. It's making it difficult to make my schedule. As is, I will literally be in class from 11am-6pm, Tu/Th, but I have no classes Monday or Friday. wtf? I can't really fit anything else. And making art on things you aren't interested in isn't all that educational if you ask me. I managed to find one Wednesday class, which goes for 3.5 hours. Eech. (But it's a film class, so I guess that makes more sense? I have another film/ARTH class though, that isn't like that at all). <eos> \n",

Would appreciate actual salary for intern or post graduation jobs.  thank you  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I guess I'll join the bandwagon of CMSC questioners. I am scheduled to take CMSC 250 next semester, and CMSC 216 the semester after. The only issue is that I'm a math major. Thus, I already know most of the topics of CMSC 250 from Math 410, Math 310, and Stat 410. Should I just test out of CMSC 250? My only concern is that, if I do test out of CMSC 250, then I will have to take CMSC 216, Math 411, and Math 405 concurrently next semester. That doesn't sound like fun. Another option may just be to take the H-version of CMSC 250, so I don't get bored out of my mind. Any advice? EDIT: I should note that math majors *are* allowed to test out of CMSC 250 even after starting the CS track. <eos> \n",

Specifically rentals for houses and townhomes (I'm trying to avoid apartment complexes.) I ask because in my area (out of state) I'm in a college town so it's very easy to secure an August lease in February. Whereas all the housing ads near UMD I'm finding are for April and May. I'd rather not wait till the last minute but unfortunately being out of state makes searching harder  Advice is appreciated!  <eos> \n",

In freshman and sophomore years of high school I had a 3.8 and 3.4 respectively, unweighted. I took five AP classes my sophomore year and got 3 fours on the exams and 2 twos.  My junior year I enrolled in a program that allowed me to attend community college full time for the last two years of high school. I had a 4.0 both semesters of this year and am majoring in both computer science and math. I am also involved with the schools game development club and their honor society. Also have a fairly strong work/volunteering background.  1280/1400 SAT. Took it once, considering taking it again.  <eos> \n",

UMD is one of the Universities I am strongly considering, however as an international I can't really just go over and take a look. I've learned as much as I can by reading on the internet but there's no substitute for hearing it from the mouths (keyboards) of those who actually go there. So I would like to ask, what are your experiences of UMD? Looking for advice on everything from housing + housing prices, class sizes, campus life, and social scene. Thank you very much! If you want to ask me anything which might help you give better advice then let me know :) EDIT: I'm English, so any information on soccer teams I can join and lager I can drink is very welcome.  <eos> \n",

However, the discussion time for Chem271 conflicts with another class I am taking, so on Testudo there is a warning about the \"course conflict\" on my schedule. In the past I've had professors who didn't care if you attended a different discussion section than the one you were assigned, so I was wondering if I will need to change my schedule to solve the conflict, or simply ignore it and attend a different discussion during the week.   <eos> \n",

There's no specific time that we have to log in because it says on ELMS \"class details on ELMS\" but do you still have to \"go to class\" Mond-Fri?

            "<bos> Hi reddit, I'm an Electrical Engineering student here in UMD and I have been many concerns. To start off, I have always been a Grade A student throughout my time before college. IB student in high school so I'm actually used to the workload that college has presented me. That being said I decided to major in Electrical Engineering after my first year because I have been told that Engineering was a very efficient major to go into if I wanted a high-pay job. I have many concerns ever since. Note that I have never done anything related to Electrical Engineering. At first the experience was not too overwhelming since I did not partake in any actual ENEE classes since I was still finishing up pre-requisites for those classes. After that semester was done, I enrolled in some ENEE classes and at first I thought the major was doable. I found myself not really interested in learning about circuits (ENEE205) although learning how to program (ENEE140) was definitely a new experience that I enjoyed. I didn't do too well but I was sliding by with B's and C's. This semester however I have struggled to understand a lot of the subjects that I've been taught. Programming became almost undoable (ENEE150 with Hawkins) but I was told from everyone to stay in because no one ever fails if they just try. I am failing to understand circuits (ENEE303) as much as I did before and have come to a point where I may have to take a W (drop out of the class). I am not struggling to grasp digital logics (ENEE222) at all because I have no interest in what the professor is trying to teach and even though I believe I have spent many hours studying/reviewing for the course, I still cannot understand it nor keep myself interested in what the professor has to say. This being said I am doing horrible in the class. I know this is rant but I need some help or someone with similar experience on this situation. I am cornered to deciding whether I still want to continue EE and drop some courses and hopefully understand them next time, or simply changing majors because I feel like I cannot seem to make myself become interested in the topics I am presented. I have many friends that have been trying to convince me to stay with it because I am already in my junior year of college and if I changed now I would have to basically restart and attend additional years in college which is not my optimal plan. If anyone could give me any tips I would truly appreciate it.  <eos> \n",

I took the first pop quiz and bombed it because I didn't memorize the vocab words from heart. Are the exams like this as well? I really dislike the idea of studying so much for a intro level gen ed compared to STEM classes so I'm wondering.  <eos> \n",

According to the Bursar site ([penalties page]([url link] they charge you 5% of the unpaid balance, in addition to the 1.5% finance charge. Do they actually charge the 5% in most circumstances, or is there any way to avoid it? I have no problem paying a small penalty (1.5% monthly won't be too much since i'll have it paid soon). But i'm slightly panicking right now especially since i'm paying out-of-state tuition. Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I'm a first-semester student transferring into UMD this spring from a Virginian university. I'm not in the College of Engineering yet, but I plan to major in Computer Engineering. I've taken a look at LEP information, the suggested CE Four Year Plan, CE credit requirements, and CORE credit requirements, but I don't understand it all... After my orientation tomorrow I will hopefully have a schedule scheduled and a plan for the next years solidified. Could any of you please advise me with other things, like *what classes should I take in certain years?*, or *what are course workloads like as CE majors?*, or **is there anything you suggest I do differently since I am starting a semester behind schedule?** I'm really just looking for general advice and information... anything concerning being a CE major, being a Spring Semester Freshman, etc. Thank you so very much! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am a freshman at NYU planning on applying to Smith in Fall 2018 for the Spring semester. I understand that I need to complete Calc, Stats, and Intro to Accounting, but is it okay if I am in the middle of completing one of the gateway courses (stats) during the time that I am applying (in fall 2018)? Like by the time I get into UMD I will have completed the gateways but during the time that I apply, I'm in the process of completing the last gateway. Is it possible to take Math for Econ as a gateway instead of calc? It has the same difficulty as calc (maybe harder) and is accepted as credits, but idk if it's equivalent. Also, would transferring from NYU make it easier for me to get accepted to Smith from NYU? Will I need a lower GPA than most other people? I will prob have a 3.5 and have a 30 ACT. I've emailed the admissions office and they haven't replied. thanks a ton for your replies! EDIT: before anyone says something, I'm not in stern  <eos> \n",

We as UMD students must show the government what Bobby Shmurda means to us, we should all walk out, even if we are in class, and march at 2 p.m. on September 13th in front of the the McKeldin library.

Does it have any good internship/job opportunities? What are the strongest courses?  I'm interested in public libraries right now (though I'm open to other options, this is just where my experience is), and I want to find out if UMD focuses entirely on the information science side, or if pursuing more library science stuff is difficult or unsupported in this program. I don't know if I'll click with a strictly information science program, and I don't want to pigeon hole myself in a focus I don't like by accident. Thank you! <eos> \n",

I just got a letter in the mail saying that enrollment starts on March 1st, and ends May 1st in a first come first serve basis. My question for anybody that knows the answer is how fast spots fill in the FC program. I am asking because I applied to VT early decision because it is my first choice, and got deferred for General Engineering. They just announced today that admissions decisions will be posted on March 5th, which is a few days after enrollment starts for freshman connection.  Is that enough time to wait to enroll, because I will probably commit if I don’t get into VT. <eos> \n",

I've also just been offered my first TF position within the department in a class I did really well in, but I'm not confident I would be a very helpful TF because it is a coding class. I'm considering it because it's a sweet gig, but I'm also worried about time management with my new job and my possible shortcomings as a TF. I'm taking 15 credits, 9 of which are gen-ed for a minor, I've been able to keep extremely good grades so far but have not held a job before, and the only lab section I am free for is 8-9:50am on Fridays. Which sucks. Long story short, is it worth it? The money and experience would be nice but not sure I could handle it this semester and Friday morning is such a bad time. <eos> \n",

But I hate hate hate calculus and economics requires calc (math 120) so I’m just going to drop it. What can I replace econ with that is semi useful in terms of employment and good for law school? I’m thinking Philosophy but idk Is Gvpt  Philopshy a useful combo in terms of getting economic/gov related internships and stuff? Because I’m still interested in econ and taking econ classes just not majoring in it...because I cannot take a calc class again.

I was thinking that although I won't come ahead much with cashback, I can get the benefits of using a credit card. I can also make a positive impression on paypal as a high spender and thus getting better customer service and better limits. Click select payment method and it'll display the message about 2% [url link] My question is whether or not it is worth to pay my tuition with a credit card and I'm leaning towards yes. I actually come out a little ahead in cashback. Let's say my tuition is 10000. I would get charged 200 surcharge since .02(10000)=200. I would get then get (10000+200).02= 204 as cashback. 10,000+200-204&lt;10,000 9996&lt;10000 This means I pay $4 less since I'm paying 9996.  <eos> \n",

Testudo updated a while back to only load secure ([url link] content, and OurUMD doesn't have an SSL cert.

I know I want to eventually by an architect but I also know that I'll never love another school like I do Maryland. So what do I choose? Any major options at UMD that you recommend?

            "<bos> Hi guys, I have two quick questions: 1. I see that some AMSC courses are cross listed between CMSC, but it says credit is only granted for one course. So is there any advantage to taking these courses? 2. Does anything involved with CS honors count toward major requirements?  Also, in general, I'm a sophomore (3rd semester) currently in CMSC330/351 + MATH246/401. I'd appreciate any tips for scheduling CS/Math 400s for a lighter workload or even an early graduation (if that's possible for me, tell me if I'm being waaaay too ambitious lol). <eos> \n",
            "<bos> My brother (not me) is an incoming freshman, and right now he is planning on pursuing a double major in Mech E and Computer Engineering.  I have several friends in each program, and my general impression is that, while Mech E a pretty significant amount of work, and Computer Engineering is even more difficult and complicated.  He is a pretty smart kid, and is definitely going to place out of a bunch of intro courses. He already took the equivalent of cmsc131/2 at UMBC (as a junior in highschool) and should place out of calc 2, some physics, engl101 and some chem with AP credit.  Is it actually possible for someone to double in these majors and still graduate within four or five years? At first glance I thought that there was a lot of overlap between the two in terms of courses, but the more I looked the less I saw.  <eos> \n",

The fact that we're up against a ranked opponent, AND on ESPN AND IT'S RED OUT makes it more likely to be this weekend.  Anyone else have any guesses?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been looking around for universities that offer remote/online master programs for cybersecurity and narrowed it down to UMD due to their classes content, which seemed to have some great options (reversing, embedded security, etc). I also work as a pentester but wanted to do more school.  I did my Bachelors at UAT for network security and I thought it was a joke, which is why I wanted to go somewhere better. Do you think the courses here (UMD) are good for cybersecurity? Any positive or negative feedback about the Masters Cybersecurity program would be most appreciated.  <eos> \n",

My university in Australia is a partner univeristy with University of Maryland and so it is one of the obvious choices for exchange. I was hoping to get some first hand experience about what it is like to go to UMD, what campus life is like, if the classes are any good, what it is like to be an exchange student etc. And it seemed like this subreddit might be a good place to ask.

I've heard that sometimes it can be good to take Bio 101 even if you took AP Bio because it's more intensive and offers a better understanding. So would you guys recommend taking 101 or 201? <eos> \n",

I know one of his exams is a take home exam, but that makes me think it's going to have ridiculously hard questions. Is he a good lecturer?

First off, [link to website]([url link] and [link to app store]([url link] I posted here [a few weeks ago]([url link] looking for people to help beta test my new app, Classify. Now I'm here again to tell everyone that it's finally released, and to download it and support a fellow Terp! There are already over 150 users and new content to discover is being posted every day.  User reviews on iTunes have been extremely positive with one user, \"avg umd student\", summing up the app particularly well: \"Really smooth interface, really like it. Just needs to get more traffic and I see it taking place of those annoying FB groups.\" I'm currently working on a web version to open up the service to students without iPhone's, and an android version as well. Thanks for taking the time to read this post! Get Classify! <eos> \n",

I will be entering UMD as a sophomore transfer student in the fall. I did not take a math during my freshman year at another University. I took the math placement test and found myself struggling with the 2nd module. This did not surprise me considering that I have not done any Algebra since junior year of HS. I'm assuming I should take Math 113, which is pre-calc, correct?  <eos> \n",

CMSC330 CMSC351 HACS208P (Seminar for ACES program) MATH246 STAT410 Is this doable? I am thinking I may have to push 330 or 351 to Spring 2018 if this course load is too difficult. The semester after that, I will probably take a 400 level CS class, and STAT420 if I can.  Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I contacted IT awhile back but they were unable to help. Just checking to see if anyone else has had this problem? More details of my issue can be found here: [[url link] EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone. This looks to be a common issue at UMD and can't be solved as of yet. The IT person assigned to my last ticket said they're pushing for MAC registration for these kinds of issues but as of now there isn't anything that can be done. Guess I'm buying an Ethernet adapter. Hope this helps someone in the future! <eos> \n",

I tried to google it but I didn't find anything. Is it equivalent to information technology? What about information systems? 2. I'm in cmsc132 and I'm having so much trouble already. It's just way too challenging for me and I prob cry all the time about it. And so I want to change to information science. Is it much more easier than comp sci?? I know I don't need any maths but are the 300 and 400 levels pretty challenging like the comp sci 300 and 400 levels?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The apartment is nice, and right next to the elevator. As for the roommates, we are both girls and will be seniors next year. We like quiet and people who are chill, but we are always up for a good impromptu fiesta. Our majors are Spanish/Education and Computer Science. We both cook our own food, and our living room has a LOT of food shelves, so if you would like to room with us it would be preferable if you enjoyed food a lot too. Roommates who cook are always welcome. We also like people who are weird (like enjoy listening to porn for the blind, reading strange fanfiction pairings, and laughing at other people's Facebook pictures).  We are not incredibly neat. Don't get us wrong, we aren't DIRTY, but we're messy. The common area will probably always be artfully almost-neat-but-still-messy but we leave ample comfortable space to sit, walk and eat. We don't drink, smoke, or party. Don't really care if you do as long as it's not in the apartment and there's no vomiting. We do have boyfriends who will occasionally visit and possibly stay overnight, but we're considerate and it likely won't happen very often. If you have a SO, they are welcome in our apartment as long as they clean up after themselves and you guys are also considerate! Major note: We like to talk out any problems, so we need a roommate who can be open and say what they need to say. Passive aggressiveness is the worst. Just be chill. PM me for more info or feel free to ask any questions! <eos> \n",

Anyone mind answering some questions / DMing me?  1) is there a limit to how many courses you can take in one semester? Like with CS you can only take 2, maybe 3. Would it be possible to take like 4-5 of the Info Sci courses? 2) How are the courses? Professors / Content solid?  3) Job employability / internship opportunities? How have Info sci grads and majors been faring? 4) If I’m transferring from CS, what classes can I place out of? I’ve finished 131,132,Stat400, Math240   <eos> \n",

Iowa was a team the Terps defeated last season but, despite mediocre preseason expectations, the Hawkeyes are one of the remaining undefeated teams in college football.

But instead of the mods having all the input as to what this place looks like, we think it would be cool to have a little contest where you guys could submit your own banners and the community could vote on which one they like best. You all could probably do 1896629084x better than me at designing this thing anyway. Winner gets to have their banner where our normal red one is up on top of r/UMD! It would be pretty simple, we could set a deadline to submit your banners, I would collect them all into a new thread and everyone can vote. Thoughts? Opinions?

I live about 3-4 hours away (traffic depending) so it would mostly just be used for driving to and from home for break, etc. On the UMD DOTS page it says \"Students with a class standing of Junior and above are eligible to register for parking. Freshmen and Sophomores are eligible on a space available basis.\" I was wondering if someone could clarify what \"a space available basis\" means. Is every student assigned one parking spot, but freshman have to find an empty one? Also, does this mean I still pay the full price? Or is this something more like seniors and juniors get first pick and whatever happens to be left over can be claimed by freshmen and sophomores?

You can create events and invite people right from the app, in seconds. It also lets you find friends of friends interested in the same activities so you can ask your mutual friend if they're cool and if they would want to join you the next time you and your friend hang out, for an easy way to meet awesome people on campus.   Coming soon:  *Make or Flake score - it's not cool to be stood up! TerpSocial will let you know who shows up and who flakes  *Invite any friend to your events without them needing the app  *Your Idea Here!!   Try it out and let me know what you think! <eos> \n",

I was thinking about biking to class since I will be living in the varsity this upcoming semester, and it is a pretty long walk to some of my classes. Even though I am living at the varsity I am only a freshman, so I have no clue about how logical it would to bike to class.  <eos> \n",

I am doing this as a part of my scholars capstone project (and from the bottom of my heart) ((Okay mostly just for my capstone)) and I would really love to help some of your organizations out if interested! Furthermore, if you already have a website, but think that it could use some updating, I'd also love to help you out too! Just take note that I am but a measly UMD student who has his own schedule, so I will need some time to complete website requests. ;) So, if you're interested, let me know either in the comments or pm me so I can give you more details! Also, if there are any clubs that you personally think should have their own website, but don't have one, also let me know! I can try to get in contact with them!  Just make sure to let me know as soon as possible, I won't be able to take on too many requests in just 1 semester unfortunately. <eos> \n",

As of right now, the forecast has 1-3 inches of snow in CP on Friday evening and freezing rain on Saturday morning. I am curious if anyone KNOWS (based on knowledge of the policies involved or past experience) what would happen if the university is closed or has a delayed opening during the time of my final. Would it be postponed to the next day? The last day before break? I am asking because I have a flight scheduled for Sunday morning (this is my last final) and I am beginning to worry I may have to change my travel plans. I know it's still 5 days away, so the forecast may well change, but I want to be prepared just in case  <eos> \n",

I can pull in people into Alleghany Hall on south campus. There are 2 doubles.  It is in a nice location right close to the south campus Diner.  If you are a engineering major, it is convienient because it is close to the engineering buildings.  Also if you have friends living in the commons, its really easy to go visit them because the commons are just right next to Allegany as well.  Message me if you are interested. I just would like to get to know about what type of person you are and if we would get along.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So, I am in a tough spot right now, and am unsure what to do about the whole situation. I am currently a finance and supply chain double major, and thought I would love everything about business, because it is what my dad does for a living and wanted to follow in his footsteps, but I'm quickly realizing I do not enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would. I am currently a junior and was planning on graduating next spring, but I am currently unsure about that. I really cannot see myself spending my entire professional career in the world of business, and was considering switching majors.  Yes, I know that is probably the worst thing I could ever consider, but it is something I am seriously thinking about. I was considering either switching to mechanical engineering, because I have always had an interest in engineering, but thought business would be more enjoyable. I was also considering switching to computer science, because it just seems very interesting to me, and I could see myself spending my life doing something that involves computer science.  So, I was just looking for some opinions on the matter. Feel free to call me an idiot and stupid for even considering switching majors this late in my college career, because I know that it is crazy. Yes, I know if I did switch I would be spending a lot more time in college, but money is not an issue for me, so I could afford to rent an apartment, and stay for how ever long I would need to in order to complete my degree. Thanks in advance guys, I appreciate any advice you guys can give.  <eos> \n",

For example, I am more comfortable with Java (I'm no expert with Java) than I am with Python. If the interviewer asks me something complex about Python or about other languages on my resume, and I unsurprisingly don't know the answer at all, how should I respond? Also, in general, how do you respond to question that you have no idea about or that you might have a vague idea about? <eos> \n",

Either that or someone stole it out of my backpack, which is unlikely.  But anyways, its currently locked as well. It has a fold over black case, and blue headphones. If anyone knows anything about this, or maybe was at the library and saw someone take a iTouch off of a table that was unattended around this time, I'd deeply appreciate a PM, and dinner on me! <eos> \n",

I am going to take calculus 2 in like a week (I really want to do well in mathematics...). I already got accepted to UMD, but my major is Statistics. Mind you I did great in statistics... I am going to try harder this time. My question is, will the credit for calculus 1 still transfer to UMD as passing? And if it doesn't, and I end up doing well in calc 2 at my community college, do I have to retake calculus 1 at UMD?  <eos> \n",

PHYS161 looks like a calc based physics class but in the description on testudo it states \"First semester of a three-semester calculus-based general physics course.\" What exactly does that mean? Do I have to take two more semesters of this class for all my credits to count or can I just take three credits of just this one semester with this class and I'll be good? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I took 420 almost a year ago but had to take an incomplete because of some family health issues at the very end of the semester. I need some serious help because I don't remember the material/wasn't there for it. However I really need to get that credit because I already have a job lined up in Seattle (committed to it last summer, before I took 420).  PM me if you think you can help me out. I'm pretty nervous because I don't want to lose my offer because I have to stay an extra semester to retake 90% of 420.  I am in touch with the TA Adam but he's pretty busy which is understandable, he says he basically runs Meesh classes. tl;dr: Have incomplete work for 420 and don't remember anything, need to finish it before I'm supposed to start working across the country. Please help. Not poor but desperate. <eos> \n",

I already asked my CSMC131 lecturer, but he said he couldn't agree to do it on principle (\"We have over 700 students in CMSC 131 and many take this COMM class. If we say yes to one, we would have to say yes to all.\")  When I asked if he had any suggestions for a different professor I could interview, he basically said it would make more sense to try to interview someone else that wasn't a professor. Could anyone help and suggest someone on campus or a specific professor that I could interview? I have a backup, but it would be very nice to find someone on campus. <eos> \n",

Regardless, I have been able to fulfill all of my assistantship duties to the best of my ability, but the treatment has put me behind in my coursework. Thus, I am still ineligible to move into candidacy, and will require a fourth year.  My assistantship covers five credits every semester, and expires after three years, which is the expected duration of the degree program. Next year, I will be paying out-of-state tuition on the remainder of my degree, which I had not anticipated, and will likely be very hard to afford.  I asked if the remaining two credits could be put towards my university fees, which add up to over $1000 (for this semester alone), and was told that \"there is no mechanism\" that can transfer the funds. The value of the credits is almost exactly the same, maybe even a little bit more. Would it be that terrible for the university to waive the fees?  After all the money that it's cost me so far in these past two years, I am not dropping out, but I cannot wait until this is over.  <eos> \n",

First off, I know no place is perfect... but I'm trying to find something that is a good balance. Mazza seems nice, given it's relatively close, new, and is already furnished, etc.  Anyone have places comparable to this? I'm a sucker for new/clean (hence why I'm considering Mazza), so anything like that? Varsity and View are more expensive, so that's out of the question.  I'll be living with a friend so 2 bedroom apartments is my goal, and I'll have my car with me.  Suggest/comment away! Thanks! <eos> \n",

I've never done this before, but am I right in understanding that I just need to drop the class in testudo? That's it? Just go to drop/add and hit drop? I would hate to miss a step and screw my GPA/Transcript. Thanks all! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello all! I'm a junior computer science student who just transferred into UMD and I'm I feel like I'm falling a little behind compared to my school mates. This week has been busy with all sorts of companies coming to recruit interns for their companies and I feel a bit left out. I have some experience in computer science outside of school and I'm currently in CMSC132. I love programming and have a great passion for computer related stuff. Even though CMSC132 is a bit of a tough course, I enjoy every bit of it and I'm looking forward to learn more programming skills outside of school. During high school I was modding games and doing basic scripting and during my freshman year in a community college I developed my own android game and published it on Google Play. Even though its not a sophisticated game, I feel proud of creating it. ([url link]  I know I have a lot more to learn and develop more skills to be in par with many computer scientists here. My game plan is to learn more about computer science and all the related stuff during my junior year and then start focusing on internships and such during my senior year. Is this proper? Will companies look down on me for beginning my internship during senior year, or even after graduating?  I'm sorry for sounding so simpleminded but I'm just clueless and the transfer experience for me has been a bit daunting. Also, any tips on what companies look for on the resumes? Can I put basic skills that I have. Over the summer I learned basic HTML, CSS, and also SQL programming, not anything extensive though. Is it worth putting things like this?  Thank you!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> To start I know I'm technically in the wrong, but this is some bullshit.  There are meters outside of Prince Frederick Hall with a sign that say they're good daily from 7:00AM to Midnight. I parked at one, and went to pay for a half hour, and it let me. These are digital meters, and they can be set to not accept fares at certain times of day, but this one wasn't. It wasn't until I had dropped my stuff off in my room and got back to my car to find a ticket, and saw a sign that contradicted the meters, saying those spaces were for state vehicles only on weekdays during day time hours. Everyone knows that dots is brutal, and I was trying to comply with the rules, I shouldn't have to make sure that there aren't signs anywhere around that contradict ones that say I can park. A meter shouldn't take my money if I'm not allowed to park there at that hour. TL;DR, make sure you find and read every sign around where you park, don't stop once you've found a sign that gives you permission <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm re-posting this from another thread: So here's my story: I went into college convinced that I wanted to a major related to government and politics. I had always been passionate about it and I would be studying at a university in D.C. so I thought it would be perfect for me. Fast forward to spring semester freshman year: I decided to take an astronomy course to fulfill a general education requirement and immediately fell in love it. I had also always had a passion for astronomy as well. I loved it so much that I decided to transfer here to pursue a major in astronomy. I also decided to pick up a major in physics since I was told it was crucial to have if I wanted to go on to grad school. Fast forward to present time, second semester sophomore year: I've almost completed my first semester as a physics major and it's been the most depressing semester so far. I was never great at math in high school, and so now I'm barely managing a C- in Calc 1. The more I read about what physics majors do during and after college the more I'm starting to think I may have acted on pursuing this new program too quickly without doing enough research. My GPA is most likely going to drop from a 3.8 to maybe a 3.0 if I'm lucky. Even though I love astronomy, I don't see how I can continue this for another three years; I just don't think I have the brains for it. I don't even know if the research environment is right for me. I've even dropped all my physics courses for next semester and am looking at pursuing a government and politics major, which is basically what I was doing at my old university. Should I try to give it another semester or should I just continue with what I set out to do in college in the first place with my government major? I also want to still graduate on time and study abroad, and with a physics and astronomy double major I would be graduating a year later at the earliest assuming I don't study abroad.

Police were notified out of concern for possible hate-bias.  Preliminary investigation reveals that this type of material is used to contain and protect loose items during transport. Out of an abundance of caution, we are looking into this matter and conducting a review of our cameras in the area.  We encourage the university community to continue to reach out to us when concerned as we work together to create a safer campus. \" <eos> \n",

Surprisingly enough there is no list available which lists available courses.

            "<bos> I got a couch freshman year and I loved it. Its seen two football seasons start to finish, basketball games, countless movies, and many brawl games. Unfortunately I cannot fit the couch in the place I am living next year and I'll have to let it go. In my infinite gratitude for its faithful service, I want to see my couch go to some good people. The couch is about 4.75'x2.5'x2.5' and can fit two comfortably and 3 cozily. It's a good size for a dorm room and quite clean and comfortable. If you want more information contact me at rochellelafayette@gmail.com. **TL;DR** Awesome Couch! Let me know If you want it. **Edit 1:** I am trying to sell the couch but its a really reasonable price for a piece of furniture. This will help me cover some of my expenses for the summer and next year. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Taking this class with B.Jacobs this semester. If you had to rate projects based on their difficulty level from 1-10, how would you scale it? Are they time consuming? What are they really about? I'm a commuter and drive to the University. So really just want to plan this out well mates. Also a bit nervous since haven't touched C and Verilog for the past 2 semesters.  P.S. Folks looked at the syllabus and realized he already had the project out since day 1! Since projects are 50% of the grade I'm kinda stressing it now. Any advice over these projects? <eos> \n",

Does anyone know when you have to pay lab fees? On the first day of classes? When I register? Does it show up with regular tuition?

            "<bos> So I turn 21 in December, and I've been trying to get information online about getting a horizontal license in Maryland. I've read a lot of contradicting information on how and when I'd be able to get it. Stuff about having to apply online and getting it mailed to you a week after your birthday (but no means to actually apply), just going in person the day of, being told the day of to do it online, etc. It's been confusing.  How did you guys get your horizontal license? Were you able to get it in advance at all, or did you have to go in the day of or anytime after? Additionally, if it's the day of my birthday, would I be able to buy alcohol with a vertical license at a liquor store? I've heard some of the bars might, but I'm not sure if the stores would be as willing. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I woke up this morning with such a high fever and almost passed out when I was brushing my teeth. I don't know why, but I still went to my classes even though I could barely think. What's bugging me even more is I'm not even really \"sick\" yet other than a sore throat (knock on wood).  If I wake up again tomorrow with a super high fever, or even worse, what's the chance I'll get an excused note from the health center? No matter how much I don't want to miss my CHEM135 class, I can't learn anything in class if I'm a zombie running around a 103 fever.

They appear to have made several posts on conspiracy theories last night, and then stated that they were going to kill themselves after giving away all their goods.

I know most people majoring in CS usually just minor in math but I wanted to minor in something more in the direction of the arts and humanities.

            "<bos> Hey Terps,  I was accepted to UMD and honors college (ACES) a few months ago. I applied for Comp Sci, and I am sure it's fairly well known that the CS enrollment is huge. Is the program size an issue at UMD? (If so, what issues are there and how big are they) How easy is it for someone to slip through the cracks? Compared to UMBC's program(which I am still considering, as they gave me a 10K/year scholarship [w/no honors college]), what advantages does UMD's program have above the competition? Also, does being a \"small fish in a big pond\" make it harder to compete for internships and the likes? Or do most students get an internship by means of the program reputation and connections?  Just some background on me. I have a good deal of programming experience. Although I don't consider my self amazing, I think I'm fairly good at it-- although at UMD, I fully understand I may be in the middle of the pack.  Although I am strongly leaning on going here, I just want to know what I'm getting into before I sign up.  --AtharvaLarva  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm in desperate need to take STAT400 next semester, I've heard a lot of bad things about Cremins and Millson, so I've chosen to ride the waitlist for a few of Nandori's sections instead of signing up for the open sections with one of the other two.  I'm 10th on the waitlist for 3 of his sections, do y'all think I should take my chances on the waitlist or just register for one of the open sections? Thanks in advance for any help. <eos> \n",

So as much as it pains me, I need to put my geocache up for adoption :( It's a small cache, called GEOC101, located just off south campus. It's a fun, woodsy hide, relatively hidden from muggles, which isn't so easy on a busy campus like UMD. Of course, if you decide to adopt it, you're free to do whatever you want with it! But it needs an owner who lives nearby and can respond to maintenance requests and questions and whatnot. If you're interested, please PM me! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have been taking advantage of the season tickets for recent graduates. The prices are just too good to pass up. But the 'service' is just about enough to make me forget about this school like I vowed to when I graduated.  Let's start with football. I bought season parking passes to what I was told would be 11b. I get the passes and they say 9B on the front, give the guy a call and he says it was his mistake, but it should work in 9B, 11C and a all of the permit lots. I roll with it since the passes were on a discount. First game comes and guess what, I can't park in 11C. (Makes sense from the parking pass, but not from what I was told by the box office). Really not a big deal, but why can't they get their shit straight.  Now onto basketball season. I once again bought season tickets(not for parking this time). Ticket transfer seems easy enough, either I pay $5 or the other guy pays $5 and I can transfer the ticket. So I am walking a guy through this ticket transfer process and I tell him I will pay the fee for the ticket. Everything goes great. Until UMD packs on another fee for him to print his ticket that isn't mentioned anywhere before this point. Well shit, now this guy is pissed and probably thinks I am trying to pull something over on him. Talked to the ticket office and they said that is just how it is. Once again, it is only a couple bucks, no big deal. But why they skip over the step where you have to pay them to print in the ticket transfer FAQ. I knew UMD did shit like this while you were there and they already had your money. Why did I think things would be different afterwards? On a good note, I was glad to go to Hoover to see UMD Soccer play, regardless of the result.  <eos> \n",

I was accepted into the College Park Scholars program also, and that is one of the things causing me a bit of anxiety in figuring out how to have a successful first year of college. I have some questions, and I will number them so you can answer some/all of them. 1. Have any of you done/known anyone who has done arts, international studies, or media self and society? What was the general impression? 2. Is Scholars more helpful in the long run (think resumees, recognition over doing no special programs) or more of a waste of time, especially since I may double major? 3. Are the kids like typical college students? Would I have a good social life living in a smaller community? 4. Which program would you suggest for me based on my psych/crim interests?  Sorry if this post is long. I don't expect answers to every question of mine, so any feedback is appreciated! Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm working on a short film and I need a few extra to play real minor roles and figured ask here first cause they're gonna take place in the UMD area. -First is a hippie bro/ frat bro/ bro bro type. Just a minor speaking role for one scene. Takes place entirely on campus. -The second role I'm hoping to accomplish is a scene where we use a outdoor faucet outside your house/condo/crib/business. This one doesn't have to be necessarily filmed in UMD area but I just need access to an outfoor water faucet of some sort. If anyone knows of any just let me know. If you personally have access to one you can play a minor speaking role which is just one line. -Another is an unseen speaking role for someone who has a newcaster like voice. If anyone is interested in helping out on the crew any extra help is always awesome. If you're interested in acting and these roles don't suit you hit me up anyway. I'm always trying to make new movies. I've attached a few screen of what we have so far. Just let give you a scope of what we're trying to accomplish. Thank you! [url link] <eos> \n",

Ive tried all the suggested solutions from spotify; disable firewall, restart programs, reinstall programs, set up ad hoc networks to sync over, resetting my wifi settings, ive tried using both umd and umd-secure wifi without any luck.  Basically the only thing I can think of is marylands wifi is blocking the transfer of these files from my computer to iphone when theyre both on the university wifi. I wont be able to make it home to test a different network for a couple weeks so I figured id ask here in the meantime.Has anyone else had this problem and was able to solve it somehow? <eos> \n",

My ideal apartment would have no problems with bugs and rats, would have reliable hot water and heating/AC, wouldn't be loud (at least during the week...) and would have ShuttleUM service. Oh yeah and the cheaper the better... I pay $750/mo right now which includes utilities. My room is a decent size, I share a bathroom with one person, and the house is pretty big.

I thought that any given thursday, friday, and saturday, I would be able to walk down college and find at least 4 open parties. Inevitably, I was disappointed that people would be so exclusive, that people would be so content with the shitty bars (and yes they are shit). But last night, parties were open, people were included. It wasn't about being a fratstar or a GDI...it was about raging.  Gentlemen, this year has been an ABORTION for Maryland. Maryland will soon get the reputation that people here simply do not know how to party if we do not change things now.  So next year I challenge you. Fraternities and GDIs alike, RAGE HARD. Throw bangers. Let girls and guys in to said parties. Show the nation that Maryland is not a college full of pussies.  Thank You -college ACB <eos> \n",

College is expensive afterall. Is the I.S or IT degree respected here? Thoughts? I now the major is new here, do you think that will affect job opportunities? <eos> \n",

I don't think I can afford much more. I have no problem walking/biking a mile or more per se but I'm worried that if I live too far people will be reluctant to come over/ I will lose a college feel to the area. How much do utilities typically add a month? I live a 40 minutes drive away now so i can drive to college park to look but is there a good way to go about doing this? <eos> \n",

I register for classes tomorrow at 9 AM, and I saw that the prerequisites for ENGL390 include ENGL101 and 60 credits or more as well as junior standing or higher. I meet all of those requirements except for one, since I'm a sophomore. However, my advisor still told me to take it and she knew I'm a sophomore. Basically, regarding if I can take it as a sophomore, is she wrong or is the description on the schedule of classes wrong? Any help is appreciated <eos> \n",

Is there a game shop or something that runs campaigns or does anyone want to get one together? I'm not against DMing. Edit: I wasn't expecting turnout! A game with more than 4-6 people gets chaotic so I have to close my session for now. If anyone else wants to DM their own campaign, I can help with some materials <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently a senior in Comp Sci here at UMD. I'm currently crossed on wether I should go for the 5 yr. masters here or apply outside. I want to study deep learning / genetic algorithms.  Any former students from UMD who got into top masters programs have any advice for applying outside? / what kind of stats are required (GPA / research / how important is comp sci gpa? ...). The thing is my overall gpa is exactly a 3.5, with mostly Bs (also 2 B- (351 ;) ) and a C+ in a number theory course (math 406) ... should probably retake that...) in my CS courses so I don't know how hard it would be for applying to outside masters schools. I already know the requirements for phD programs, but I can barely find any info on CS masters admission requirements. In terms of chances, I might be a special case since I transferred from UIC (lesser known) 2 years ago with a 3.7 (both comp sci + biology major) gpa there.   The reason I'm not considering phD yet is because I didn't get much research experience so far and my CS grades aren't high enough. Some people told me to just go for the 5 year masters here, increase my GPA, and then try for phD. But I still want to know my chances of getting into outside masters, assuming I could maybe increase my gpa (~3.55 - 3.6) by next semester and do well on the GRE.  Edit: I noticed other UMD undergrads would probably be wondering as well. Especially those who have less than 3.5 who have no choice but to apply outside. A thread like this would be pretty helpful.  Thanks for the advice!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I've lost a letter grade on two tests so far this semester on questions I had right, and then changed, all because I second guessed myself. A general rule of thumb if you aren't sure about a concept is that your first assumption is normally the correct one. I'm sure most people know this, but I thought I'd reassure some people that might not be so sure when heading into a test, like I was.   TL;DR - Trust your first answer during exams. <eos> \n",

I've been getting alot of stress and anxiety from being on such a huge campus and having to see so many people on a daily basis and having iffy roommates kind of make things in that sense worse. I always feel stressed, tired, and pressured throughout the day and I find it extremely difficult to calm down and relax even in my dorm. I also find it really hard for me to have a social life that really satisfies and makes me happy. Recently it's been affecting my mental health and I'm quite worried about what to do and whether or not i could regret transferring since UMD is still often considered to be a \"better\" school. What are your thoughts? <eos> \n",

Tabs for a Cause allows you to earn hearts with every tab you open on Chrome - you can pool these hearts and donate them to a charity of your choosing.  Right now, their [March Gladness]([url link] event has just started, where colleges compete to donate the most to charity! Right now, UMD is #16 on the list.  If you're interested in participating, you can either use [my link]([url link] (which will earn more hearts towards March for Gladness), or you can just use the [regular link]([url link] in case you don't like it when people promote stuff like this for their own benefit. I think it'd be really cool if UMD could place in top ten at least - I know all you CS majors open a ton of tabs every time a project comes around! It'd be nice to make all those tabs good for something. :) Thanks for reading, and happy (early) weekend! <eos> \n",

However, because I enjoyed the experience so much, I wouldn't want to see it if the image or sound quality isn't good. I'm usually not picky, but this is my favorite movie of all time I've decided, and I wouldn't want to watch it if it's in 480p, basically. At my friends university I went one time to their free movie screenings and it was simply embarrassing... but that was a smaller school, so I was just wondering how the UMD movies are? <eos> \n",

Playing catchup pretty hard right now. My junior and senior year, unfortunately, look like this: Junior semester 1 [Current]: CMSC 132, CMSC 250 Junior semester 2: CMSC 216 Junior Summer Semester: CMSC 330, CMSC 351 Senior Semester 1: CMSC 4XX (10 Credits, 3 courses) Senior Winter Semester: CMSC 389J, CMSC389T (2 credits) Senior Semester 2: CMSC 4xx (9 credits, 3 courses) Essentially, all I have taken for the CMSC course requirements are MATH141, CMSC131, and that's it. I have all the other requirements out of the way: things like the non-CMSC requirements, upper level C.O.R.E.s, things like that. But the CMSC classes are killing me. So, I'll ask again. Is it feasible to graduate on time? Am I totally screwed?  <eos> \n",

In terms of setup, environment, what it looks like, opportunities (i.e. are recruiters mostly looking for school-year interns, summer interns, part-time employees, full time?), etc. Is it open to freshman? Also, is there another fair later in the year like winter or spring, or is it just this one? Sorry if this is a lot of questions 😅 <eos> \n",

Are there any computers available to students on campus that 1) have video editing software preinstalled and 2) are fairly high performance? I think I may have saw one in the mowatt garage computer lab but I'm not sure. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks! <eos> \n",

In the sense, is it the case where if you have all the gateways completed and have the minimum grades necessary, then are you automatically guaranteed a spot when u apply?

If someone could let me know it would be awesome. Preferably, it would be near campus and not too expensive. Apartments or houses work. Thanks! <eos> \n",

What I want to know is will I still be able to get to the next level class I want (math 220 now 120) since that is the actual class my major needs. Also what if I take math 120 during the summer is that even possible? Who'll they still require math 113 then? Thanks for the help I really appreciate it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> It seems to be very inconsistent. I often see Fedex trucks stop at the dorms and bring packages in, not sure if I've seen UPS do that. However there also seems to be some campus run delivery system. I'll see old minivans deliver big piles of packages to the dorms in the mornings pretty often. Another thing is I'll see on the package tracking that it's been delivered but I don't get it until a day or two later. Does anyone know what the deal is/what the specifics of what goes on? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I got accepted into the Honors College there and plan to major in Computer Science (and Japanese, but I have to do stuff to Double Major). I have some questions, especially since most of you are in Computer Science. 1. How much of it is math (calculus and beyond) based? I honestly hate math (not to offend anyone) and am at the moment barely tolerating AP Calc BC. It's not that I'm bad at it, I'm average, but I just don't like it. 2. How difficult is Computer Science? 3. How are the teachers? 4. How is the homework? Group/Project work? 5. Will I live?  6. Anything else I should know? (And if anyone is involved in Japanese, how is that?) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> **&lt;from an email.**  Dear Campus Community,  On Friday, May 17, First Lady Michelle Obama will visit our campus. One of our sister institutions in the University System of Maryland, Bowie State University, will hold its spring commencement in the Comcast Center and Mrs. Obama has agreed to be the commencement speaker. We are proud and excited to host the First Lady on our campus. Please note, however, that this is NOT a UMD event. Approximately 14,000 guests are expected to participate in the Commencement, therefore we should all prepare for significant traffic delays. This event will increase campus traffic during an already busy day. Friday, May 17 is both the last day of final exams and the final move-out day for students.  To try and reduce the traffic impact on that Friday, we are asking students to move their belongings out of their residence hall space by 10:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 16, if at all possible. Students with finals on this day should allow extra time for travelling to and from their exams. Detailed information will be forthcoming this week from the Department of Transportation Services regarding suggested travel routes and designated parking locations for the day.  Thank you in advance for your patience. Sincerely, Mary Ann Rankin Senior Vice President and Provost  <eos> \n",

I tried to view mine by going under Room Selection, but it says that I haven't submitted a Returning Student Assignment by the deadline. I'm not sure why I would have, since I'm an incoming first-year freshman, but now I don't see a housing assignment on that page. Can anyone help me out here? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Last week I walked through McKeldin after the Graduate Student Orientation. A friend and I got out of the elevator on the second floor and were IMMEDIATELY PUNCHED IN THE FACE with the absolutely awful smell of B.O.. Not even being dramatic at all, it was THAT bad. As we walked through the floor, we both wanted to gag because the smell was so strong. Is it ALWAYS like this, or did we happen to go when some smelly individual stank up the whole floor?? Obviously the semester hasn't started yet so we couldn't blame it on some freshman who hadn't showered since they left home or something trivial like that but it made me curious if it's just always like that? We didn't even explore the rest of the library since we just wanted to get out after that. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm an incoming freshman with a pretty bad case of senioritis. My grades are slipping a little bit and I was wondering at what point UMD would take away a scholarship from an incoming student with poorer grades than what they applied with. I specifically got the Presidential scholarship with $12k/year, but would they take that away if I get my first C in my 2nd semester of senior year of high school? Hope this doesn't come off as petty, but I'm kind of worried about it as I've heard of some kids getting their acceptances rescinded due to sub-par grades this year. Thanks so much! <eos> \n",

That means you could take the class with just 25 other students instead of 250. Man, I really wish that section worked out with my schedule. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys. I am an international student from India who recently got accepted to the university of maryland college park for cs. I just wanted to know how good the program is and had a few questions. Is the program well known  in the US? How are the professors at the university? Is the student community friendly? Also, I am more oriented towards academics and I have heard that umd has a slight party reputation. Is this true? And finally, is the umd campus safe?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Is anyone commuting from Baltimore County? I live in Pikesville and from what I understand it would take 1 hour every day to commute to college park. That's if I'm lucky and there is no traffic. How long can it take with traffic? How long do you generally commute to UMD? Should I just rent somewhere near campus? I'm finishing my last year in community college and I realy want to transfer to UMD and I have grades to do so but this commuting problem is just scary. It would take so much of my free time and money to commute.  Another question I wanted to ask is if UMD is THAT MUCH BETTER than towson? Towson is literally 10-12 minutes away from me. I'd also graduate at least 1 semester earlier from Towson because of prereqs. My major is Information Systems in Towson and either Information Systems or Information Science(if I dont get accepted into business school) in UMD.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am currently at sophomore at a liberal arts college. I'm supposed to graduate in 2014 with a BA in CS and probably a second major in math. It's nice here, but I recently found out that my parents will be expecting me to pay them back for the last two years of tuition after graduating (ouch). Maybe turning down instate tuition and merit scholarships at UMD was not such a good idea.  Between AP credits and classes here, a lot of general education requirements should be taken care of, but it looks like the core gets pretty specific and will not be fully satisfied. Edit: At this point, am pretty sure I will need to take one each from: History or Theory of Arts, Diversity, and Professional Writing. Since I only decided that I wanted to major in CS last semester, this is what I will have taken if I start at UMD Fall 2012: 1. Intro CS - recursion in Java. 2. Fundamentals of CS aka \"so you think you want to be a CS major\" - surveys lots of CS topics, mostly in SML but also Python, C, and a simulated assembler. 3. Logic and Computability - pure theory, no code whatsoever 4. Data Structures - Java and C++ The last two are next semester. With these classes coming in, do you think I could graduate in two years with a degree in CS? If it takes three years, the cost difference would go from 60k to 35k with one less year to make money after, so it will probably not be worth doing. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> My room gets ridicously hot for my comfort zone. It's at a temperature of 78-81 averagely. It's not as hot that in the living area, or roommates rooms (I presume), so someone often has the AC set on 70-75 (which doesn't cool off my room well at all). Back at my parents house/farm the temp was set at 70-72. Colder in some rooms. I have a box fan and desk fan, which helps to a degree but isn't doing the trick. Opening a window doesn't really help. I can leave the door open but not when I sleep. I live on the corner so I have two windows which radiate with heat. The BIG factor is the electronics in my small room. I have my desktop rig (off whenever possible), and the big factor of a mini fridge. I believe the mini fridge is putting off a ton of heat for my small room. Waking up to 81 degrees sucks. So I was wondering if anyone had some experience with a portable window ac unit that has a air duct to the window. Since the windows don't open that much, I was seeing if anyone had a compatible verison they know of. I'm just not comfortable (waaah). Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm hunting for housing for next year and one of the problems is that some of the great houses I've seen are a bit far from campus and other stuff. They're still in CP proper but I'm talking about places in Hollywood near Shoppers or REI, or in College Park Woods. These houses are cheap and spacious and nice but damn some of them are far removed. Anyone here live in those areas without a car? Do you find it bearable? I'd be living relatively close to a ShuttleUM stop so at least I'd have that. This year I was lucky enough to have a roommate who lets us borrow her car but I may not get so lucky next year. Not to mention she often works at night so her car isn't always available anyway.  <eos> \n",

Ideally I'd like to be close to CSIC, but the View and Varsity's price seem pretty steep.  Thanks  Also, why are prices for these places so ridiculous? It costs 900+ to live in an apartment in the middle of PG county.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm going to transfer to UMD next Fall and I can't decide what to major in.  I was leaning more towards Information Systems, but it's a Limited Enrollment Program in Business School so I might be not accepted. I'm also VERY concerned that they literally have zero programming classes. From what I understand, Information Systems is between business and Computer Science so ideal would be half of the courses in business and half in programming. Zero classes in CS is just very weird. I'm afraid I won't learn any practical skills there. I've done a little research and in other colleges practically all InfoSys Curriculums do have programming classes.  Information Science does not have limited enrollment, but, from what I understand, most people go there when they can't handle Computer Science. I'm afraid that literally every employer will look down on this major. I also don't like the fact that a lot of employers and alumnis work in Libraries. I have no interest in working in Library whatsoever. I'm just afraid that most employers will pick CS major instead of IS without thinking twice. Information Science has a lot of classes that I think can teach me valuable skills, including a couple of CS classes, and their Data Science Specialization looks interesting as well. No business courses at all though. I'm concerned that many employers just have no idea what Information Science degree means. IS/CIS/MIS is becoming more and more popular, but very few colleges have Information Science degrees.  Can you please advise me what to do in this situation? I'm really confused. Ideally, I'd like to work as business analyst or project manager and the salary aspect is very important for me. What is the average salary for fresh grad in these majors? What is the average intern salary?  Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I've worked since the start of the semester at the north campus dining hall, mainly at sprouts and at the ice cream station. I have a few things that my co-workers and I would like to say.  Please don't get angry at us for long lines when there is only one of us manning the station. We are trying our best, and oftentimes our equipment is half broken. For example the grill at Sprouts last week had a massive problem with heat and I could only use a third of the grill for stir fry. This made a huge line for stir fry and many people got angry even though I explained to them that the grill was mostly broken. Not to mention that the grill is usually insanely hot. Last week a coworker got a 2nd degree burn from one of the grills so we gotta be careful.  If you placed an order for something, please don't walk away for more than a minute. This only aggravates us and wastes our time as we (well, at least I was) have been told to make an effort to find the person before moving on. I cannot tell you how often I've worked at Sprouts and some idiot places an order then leaves for 10+ minutes, then comes back and complains why her order wasn't done yet. If you are not present, I will skip your order. I know that the lines can be long at times but you must understand that we are frequently short staffed and we will get to your order as soon as possible.  If you choose to get a milkshake past 11:45pm, we will not be happy about it.  If you spill something, please clean it up. There are napkins all over the tables and it would really help us if you just took a minute and cleaned up your mess. And for fucks sake put your trays on the conveyor belt! Too many times I've had to clean up people's trays, plates and cups from the tables. If you do this, fuck you, your parents must be so ashamed. Is it really that hard to clean up after yourself? Finally, speak up when talking to us! Especially at Global, Als grill, and Sprouts. The grill is especially loud, and you speaking like a mouse isn't doing anyone any good. Edit: also, there's something about the ice cream station that turns us into total assholes, so I apologize on behalf of all ice cream workers.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm doing the fall 2015 app right now, but I have a couple of questions. 1) ~~Do we send in our AP scores? When?~~ [asap or before the deadline] 2) ~~Can the application essays  short answer responses be informal/ funny, or are they meant to be serious?~~ [Reflect the tone of the question, or be serious] 3) I got a 3 on Human Geography (self-study), 3 on French... should I cancel these scores? Is a three considered bad or good? All of my other scores (Apush, stat, calc, enviro, lang, lit) are 4s or 5s.  4)~~I'm planning on retaking the SAT in October. Would that be in time for the November 1st deadline?~~ [Yes] 5) ~~The app ask me to put down all the classes I'll be taking as a senior, but I'm not completely sure about one of the classes in my second semester. What happens if I switch up my class after I've already applied?~~ [they know that's up in the air, just put down your best guess] 6) Is it ok if I omit my ethnicity/race? <eos> \n",

I was inspired by a post not long ago about a sleep study experiment with a large compensation (Like several thousand). Of course, this study required 4 days of no sleep and prior drug testing (lol).  I'm perhaps looking for less \"extreme\" versions of these. Also, this is directed at any location in Maryland, not just the College Park campus. If anyone wants to help a poor guy out and knows any info on these for the summer (or school year) that would be appreciated.   <eos> \n",

I don’t have to file an appeal to stay in my major. A little awestruck that my academic career was in jeopardy due to someone simply forgetting to input transfer credits.. all in all, I’m happy things worked out.  I received an email today saying that I have not satisfied my second benchmark (calculus II) for my major (PHNB) so I have to change my major. I took calculus II at a different university during the summer 2017 session and made sure that it would be accepted at umd. It seems like there was a mishap between the transferring credits process and umd never received the transcript/proof of me taking the class last summer. If I have the transcript and show them, how likely is it that my appeal to stay a PHNB major will be approved? It seems like a big misunderstanding but I’m not sure how strict umd is about being kicked out of majors and I’m really worried.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So Im really struggling with the new material in math 110. Before anyone gives me any crap about it, Im terrible at math and I miserably failed the last test (50) and Im in danger of failing the class as Ive also failed the quizzes. I have one test left and the final exam in which all I need is to pass. The material is mostly probability (currently its conditional probability and independence which he does a terrible job explaining) and I tried the free tutoring but Im still not getting it and I really need help. Im willing to pay. Its my final semester here and I desperately need this math credit. I know I should have gone for help much earlier but I didnt so now I have to live with that. Anyone who is willing to help or refer me to someone who can is very appreciated.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just moved into an apartment in an old-ish building with wood floors. The lease states that 80% of the flooring should be covered with carpet. Apparently, it's quite common in NYC in particular and mostly for the purpose of mitigating noise. (maybe to protect the floor too, but it's managed to remain in good shape after 70+ years) Nonetheless, does anyone have a suggestion on a local place to buy carpet remnants (or possibly rugs) for cheap? I'm guessing someone here has probably bought carpet to cover the floor in their residence hall room or apartment/house elsewhere. I'm just looking for something that will last a year and cover my floor without turning into tatters...nothing fancy at all. It's a studio apartment, so I need only one rug/carpet for the main area (flexible on dimensions, anywhere between 9x9 and 12x12). I'm not sure if a typical carpet store is really interested in customers who are just looking for a $100 piece of carpet...but i'd imagine there has to be a market for this sort of thing (especially near a university). Thanks for any advice! <eos> \n",

This is the cs chairs response: Dear Students: I am writing to let you know that the Computer Science Department is working hard to find the additional seats needed to meet demand for courses next semester.  We are adding capacity to currently scheduled classes and also working with faculty to identify new sections of 400- level classes. This morning, we added 230 seats to existing classes.  We will continually work to ensure the availability of classes for those students graduating in May/August of 2018.   We ask for your patience as it will take some time to get all of this accomplished. We will need to ensure proper space for classes and we will also need you to coordinate registration with your academic advisors. If we determine that we still haven’t met demand for seats, then we’ll create more capacity.  It has been a real challenge to offer enough seats for so many talented and eager students, and the Department will work hard so that you may make timely progress towards graduation.  We have heard your concerns, and we thank you for voicing them as you have. Please enjoy your Thanksgiving break. You have earned it.     Larry Davis  Professor and Interim Chair Department of Computer Science <eos> \n",

This class seems pretty intense, and the amount of notes we have is way larger than most 400x classes I've taken, including 417. Plus its in haskell, which makes it seem harder... she could ask all kinds of insane syntax /difficulty problems.. it feels kinda intense for an elective class as well.  <eos> \n",

I will miss the 12 month mark by around a month. Did anyone else successfully overcome similar residency problems? Also, what are some of the ways to reduce in state tuition?

            "<bos> Hey reddit terps, I'm a transfer student starting in the fall, and I was curious if anyone had the same experience as I put in the title. There are two reasons I believe that I didn't get my LEP. 1. Too many credits or 2. Not all pre requisites filled. I have a 3.8 gpa and 90 credits coming in, but I only switched to Engineering a year ago. Most of my credits are general education requirements. The only reason I think that the pre requisites weren't met is because I haven't done chemistry. However, physics and calc are mostly finished. So, to the point... anyone out there have a similar situation? Has anyone ever been accepted to their backup degree, but then able to apply and transfer to their desired LEP? Mahalos! 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻 <eos> \n",

Parking: Would I be ticketed or towed for parking in a non-reserved, non-short-term, regular parking space on a weekend?

If you are a Maryland resident like so many of us are, you can reach out to your local and state representatives to try and help out. Many of them are on committees that are in charge of things such as getting funding for the university. If enough people express interest they have to listen as we vote them into office. Here is a list of state representatives by district with their contact information: [url link] If you are unsure what district you are in here is a helpful site that will tell you who your representatives are: [url link] I might personally recommend calling the offices over emailing them as old fashioned as that sounds because they get bombarded by emails sometimes but political offices usually have to record how many phone calls they get about a given issue per day.

I am just wondering that has anyone had experiences with filing for exceptions to policy for summer session courses? (I am a CS major.) I filed for withdrawal last Friday for two classes I registered for summer session. One of the class finished last Friday, and the other one is still going. The reason for my petition is more of difficulties I encountered in both classes. The TA time for both classes mostly conflicted with my schedule, or sometimes there are simply too many students asking questions, thus I had a hard time having my problems solved before assignments or exams due. I have specified this in the letter of justification, however beyond that I didn't attach any other documents. The petition form seems to imply that without any supplement documents it will result in automatic denial, but I am not sure it's still the same case with summer session course--since it's not mandatory to register for summer session courses.

There was a fantastic turnout, probably 25-30 people. Although that is only 3% of the subreddit. The next one I'll plan will definitely be on a Friday. If anyone has ideas for new places to go for meetups, please suggest them, or alternatively organize your own but remember that the chosen location has to accommodate enough people. A picnic was mentioned for the Spring, which I think is a great idea. Also please suggest the best time for a Friday meetup.

Fraternities can't get their shit together with hazing. Students are unable to cross the fucking road without getting hit by a car.

Regli is a really cool guy. He was the head of DARPA for 3 years, and taught at Drexel for a while. So he really knows his stuff. But that's about all the good I can say about him.  His classes are mostly him teaching really hard concepts, but taking little time to explain the portions that are tough. He has these slides that are jammed packed with information, but he'll click to the next one like every 30 seconds. So there's no way you can take notes. And even if you are just paying attention, it might not be enough because he just glosses over the hard to explain topics. And then the projects. Oh lord those projects. They shouldn't be too tough. He gives a fair amount of skeleton code, and it's mostly just you filling in the rest here and there. Sounds easy, but he manages to ruin it.  The instructions for the projects are very unclear. He will give methods with parameters that he just doesn't explain. So now you have this X variable, but you've got no clue what it represents. In addition, he says to implement some pretty hard algorithms. This is fair for a comp Sci class, except he barely ever goes in depth about how to implement them anywhere in the slides. So it's up to you to figure out this difficult algorithm and just hope you can find how to do it on the internet.  Then there's Piazza. Obviously everyone has tons of questions because his project questions make no sense. But no one answers any of the questions. This could be attributed to not enough TAs having time to look at Piazza. But when it's the day before a project is due, and there are 7 unanswered questions just from that day, it becomes very frustrating.  His entire projects kind of turn into Googling fests since you can't rely on his slides, nor Piazza. And this is sometimes fine. But sometimes you just can't figure out your question on Google. So I've had times where I was just stuck in a project and had no way of getting any form of answer. If you're still reading, then you can obviously tell I'm very frustrated. And I am. But that's why I'm making this post.

Problem 1: I just found out I got a 5 on Calc BC and the AB subscore. I am currently scheduled for math141, because I was not sure at the time what my AP score was. What is the next logical math class for me to take? I would think it is Calc 3, since that is a continuation of what I've been doing. But when I go to the testudo website, it says calc3 is Math241, and has a prerequisite of Math241. I assume it's a typo as a class can't be it's own prerequisite, but I'm not sure if they meant Math240 instead, in which case I'd have to take linear algebra before calc 3 which doesn't make much sense to me.  Problem 2: I'm coming in to college as a freshman with 28 credits. I'm glad I have them, but it's making scheduling a bit of a pain. I definitely want to go all 4 years and I'm dead set on a computer science major, so this leaves me with only having to take, on average, 11.5 credits a semester to graduate with 120 credits. Problem is, my scholarship requires full-time student status (12 credits a semester) and I'm going to have to pay extra money for credit filler classes. This isn't a big deal as this totals to one or two classes, but I feel like it's weird to only take 12 credits a semester every semester for all of college. Any insight to either of these problems is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance guys. EDIT: Oh, and also, does anybody know if classes are still opening up and they're just keeping some closed for future orientations? Because a few of the classes I want are completely full, which seems odd in early july.

I'm not sure if I should stick with STAT400 or not since I've heard it's pretty much a joke and kind of useless and if I should even stick with the math minor or go the stat minor route because I want to do things with machine learning, data science, AI, etc. and other stuff related to those topics.

I’m looking to transfer to UMD in the next year or two and was wondering how my credentials are. I’m a political science/communications double major at Purdue University in Indiana. I’m apart of several clubs as well as being a committee leader for one and being a founding member for both of them. I also am involved in a plethora of organizing and volunteer work. Long story short I was forced to go to Purdue by my parents and am looking to transfer after realizing I was coerced to go there by them. They also stole 17k in financial aid money from me which I am currently in the process of taking legal action to get back from them. My GPA is also as low as it is (2.85) because I was coerced by my parents to major in something I did not have any interest in and I also have dealt pretty heavily with mental health issues while being in school.

Is there any way that the grade cut-off could have brought me down to an A- even though I got higher than a 93? Any previous experience would be helpful.

I applied to transfer to UM College Park for the spring but am still awaiting an admission decision. Hopefully if I'm admitted I won't be completely fucked on class selection (otherwise I'll see if I can defer admission)...most of my courses will likely be upper-level CS and related so I'll see how that goes. How is it being a commuter at Maryland? Do any of you commute from areas far away from campus? If I do end up going I'll have to commute for at least the first semester, after which I hope to find a place to live near UM. Presently I live with family in the Takoma Park area. Would I be missing out a lot socially and etc? I'd probably want to get involved with student organizations, which would likely be doable since I'll probably end up spending a lot of my time doing schoolwork on campus. What are transportation options like? It looks like the drive between my house and the University would be 20-40 minutes, depending on traffic. How is commuter parking...is it overly expensive, located in a shitty location, etc? And how are the UM shuttles? The closest one to me looks like it's at Silver Spring...so I could either a) take Metro or Ride-on bus to SS and take the shuttle from there (seems like a waste just to go 1 Metro stop away), or b) take Metro to College Park and take the shuttle bus from there.

Shortly thereafter, I got a few emails about selecting an honors program, chose EIP because business interests me, but am slowly regretting that decision.

You can read more about this [here.]([url link] There's been some talk of people shutting off their phones during this period to back up the message server and potentially crash it or something. Alternatively, if you have a class during this time with a less than tech-savvy professor, record their reaction to everyone's phone going off at once (or popping up like popcorn)-- I got an Amber Alert freshman year while taking an exam with a professor who still used a flip phone, and we had to take a good five minutes to explain that we weren't all cheating with each other, but this was an involuntary notification that a child had been kidnapped nearby.

My biggest concern about college is that I am gay and I am wondering about how i will be received. Can any of you tell me if the LGBT community is active. I am going to be quite blunt right now: I am all for being treated equally but I don't particularly care for the gay rights movement. I don't like the way they are going about it. I respect the people who do partake in it, but I don't like it myself. I also could say that I have my feminine moments like every gay guy but I am mostly not overly flamboyant. I just like video games, foreign language and the occasional man. I know that makes me sound like an asshole, but I'm just describing myself.  At any rate, if there is anyone here who can help me out with this or if there are any gay or lesbian people here than can help me out. I think I would join the LGBT club, which I saw at Maryland Day, but was too afraid to approach. Basically, my fear is that I will be victimised and whatnot for being gay.

When the screen is off, you can't see it but it's visible when the screen is on and it caused the rest of the screen to go black. That meant I had to turn in my laptop to IT to be sent to Apple to be fixed for an unknown amount of time. I was wondering what options I have to do homework without a laptop besides using a desktop at McKeldin. I was fine doing that earlier but I prefer to do homework alone as doing it in public is somewhat distracting. Also it's kind of annoying to have to walk 5 minutes to do homework.

First Look Fair is the annual event where over 500 student groups, organizations, and departments will table out on the mall. It's a great way for students, especially underclassmen, to find ways to get involved and learn what this university has to offer. Here on /r/UMD, we host our own little virtual version of the First Look Fair. Feel free to promote groups that you are involved in. Be sure to give name and description of the group and add links to Facebook, Twitter, group emails, or ways to sign up. Just some advice to all the underclassmen: if you're interested in something, try it out. You might find out it's not your thing and never show up again but you might also meet some really cool people that share a similar interest and turn a hobby into a passion. There's over 800 active student groups so there's something for everyone and if you can't find exactly what you are looking for, you can even create your own group! *** *Additional Resources* * [First Look Fair 2015: Reddit Edition]([url link] * [First Look Fair 2016: Reddit Edition]([url link] * [OrgSync]([url link] - Browse student groups online <eos> \", \"<bos> Somehow, in a larger venue than last year (Armory), hackers still have to go through: 1) Poor to nonexistent wifi which removed the benefit of QR code scanning leading to 2) extremely slow/manual sign-in and they are turned away after waiting hours to come in? I understand over-registering, but they cut off almost 150 people last night. That is absurd.  After the cutoff announcement, they continue to let people in on the condition that they do not get food. This process was impromptu and not organized.  Bitcamp has been on campus since 2014.

Got pretty bad grades. Decided I needed to fix myself and joined the United States Marine Corps....discharge 4 years later (July 2016).

Right now it seems the only time slots are 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. and maybe 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. Reference: [url link] <eos> ', \"<bos> Hi, you may have heard of Bitcamp, but if you haven’t, it is the UMD hackathon taking place in Xfinity Center next weekend, April 7th through 9th, Friday through Sunday. Hackathons are a great opportunity for students to learn, network, and take part in an awesome community. The basic idea of a hackathon is that we have companies that come and sponsor the event, and they have competitions for a specific software or a specific problem, and people can submit their solutions to try to win prizes. Plus, it's completely free, including meals. And if you don’t feel too confident with your hacking abilities, or don't have nay experience with CS at all, don’t worry, because Bitcamp has so many opportunities to learn. We host workshops, which are lectures given by sponsors and specialists to learn more about things like mobile dev, graphic design, or hardware. We also have mentors throughout the event there to support you and help any way they can. We have people from all majors come and participate, especially because you can join a team and provide your own expertise in whatever you're good at, even if it isnt coding.  So I encourage everyone to register. But more than that, in order for Bitcamp to function, we need volunteers to help us make it happen. So if you have any availability that weekend and think you might be able to help us, please sign up at [url link] . If you sign up as a volunteer or mentor, you automatically get access to all the free meals and all the events during the weekend. We really appreciate any help you can give us.

Currently, I'm scheduled for 16 credits my upcoming semester. With 21 dual campus credits from a local CC, I can drop a class and still reach 45 credits by the end of my freshman year. This will allow me to apply to the business school. I have a few options: **Drop ECON200** I'm not a fan of this option. If I don't get accepted to Smith, ECON is the back up option. However, I do have a 4.0 after 21 credits and ECON appears to be the hardest course this upcoming semester.  **Drop STAT100** The only reason I'm taking this class is to prepare myself for Business Stats next semester. This class fills zero requirements. How closely related are STAT100 and Business Stats. Should I drop this class? **Drop KNES287** This class seems like it'll be fun and easy.

Apparently band/guard people move in a week early to get prepared and all, but I don't think I'll be able to do that due to familly issues. Will I still be able to join? Would it hurt me much?

Since everything is so late and it'll probably take a while for the school to process my financial aid, I don't think I'll get a spot in Freshman Connection if I enroll because it's first come, first serve. AND SO I was just wondering whether anyone had any suggestions as to what I should do for a semester if I don't get into Freshman Connection.

I didn't discuss it with my advisor, but I was under the impression that it was not a mandatory course, and he has never said anything about it. I've since declared a major. I was just talking with friends, and someone told me they were pretty sure UNIV100 was required. Am I now fucked and am I gonna have to take UNIV 100 as a sophomore or something???

As I got closer, I double checked both parking receipt and time (2 mins before limit). The DOTS guy tried to tell me that I\\'m getting a parking ticket so I told him that I still had two minutes and took out my receipt. He and another DOTS person in the car looked at each other and didn\\'t hand me the physical ticket. I thought that was the end of it but when I checked my parking account, there was a citation for the \"expired meter\".  So, this is just a heads up to everyone. Luckily, I had my receipt and appealed but not sure what DOTS is going to try next. Seriously, this campus is awful because of them.  **edit:** So they voided the ticket but I still want to get the word out to as many people as possible. From the suggestions, I\\'ll try to tweet them (don\\'t have twitter account yet), email President Loh, and try to file a complaint to DOTS (doubt they would do anything about it). It would really help if you guys also did the same. Thanks.  <eos> ', '<bos> Old Dominion Brewhouse in the UTC town center in Hyattsville is now hiring for servers and hosts.

I'm trying to upgrade to a custom PC that I leave at home, and a cheap Google Chromebook that I take with me on campus for very light note-taking and whatnot.

Alka Gandhi is teaching Econometrics 1 next semester. I'm looking at the planetterp data currently  her class GPA is a 2.03 (median is a C) + 14% fail rate). What makes her class so difficult? Is it a lot of Stata proofs? No curve? Not enough homework? 2. The follow-up question has to do with trying to land internships: So my GPA is currently a 3.06, I could push Econ422 back a semester and take Econ406 instead (the teacher has a 3.17 GPA for that class). From my understanding Econometrics is the most important class in the B.S curriculum, so it would be nice having that class under my belt before summer of 2019. Should I take Econ 406 instead, keeping my GPA above 3.0+ going into next summer  work on Python/SQL/Excel skills as well. Or should I take Econ 422 and risk gutting my GPA below a 3.0 going into next summer? Tl;dr - Econ 422 is important to take but may affect my internship chances if I drop below a 3.0. Do I worry about the classes I've taken, or worry about my GPA for an internship next summer?

The SGA, student senators, and many student groups have all mobilized over the past two weeks to see this through. Some organizations that have announced their support for the bill are:  -SGA  -RHA Exec Board  -IFC  -Numerous other student groups, fraternities, sororities, performance groups, and academic organizations have also backed the bill. Last year, after +/- grading successfully passed the senate, most students heard about it when it was already too late. Even a petition with thousands of student signatures could not change the policy which had already been decided. The only prior notice to most students before then were 2 articles in the diamondback over the entire semester, which were buried in the middle of the newspaper.  This year, we want to keep policies that will have such an adverse effect on students from passing as they have in previous years. There have now been several articles on this syllabus bill in the diamondback, including one on the front page above the fold. A few of those articles were in this week's diamondbacks. You can see the articles below.  Today, from 3:15PM-5PM (often ends earlier) is the senate meeting, where student senators you elected will vote on the issue. The meeting takes place in the Stamp student union in the Atrium (1st floor. From Testudo by the information desk, go towards the food court, first door on your left.) If you have time, please join us and show up in support of the bill. In the past, most students have not heard about legislation or even that there is a University Senate that decides things that will affect them. Help us to change this and show the faculty and staff we care about our education and the university where most of us will spend 4 or more years studying.  Again, this takes place TODAY, at 3:15PM in the Stamp Atrium.

From what I remember, the place smelt peculiar, had anti-Bush signs **everywhere**, and the guy behind the counter wore a military jacket. They sold interesting things alongside their food, including a lip balm that included THC. They had some short aisles that had dried fruit and other things.  I visited UMD for the first time in a while (3-4 years), and rushed to the Food Co-op to see if it was still like how I remembered it. However, it seemed to really change. The lighting was better, they had fewer aisles. The only decoration seemed to be a lonesome Morrisey off to the side. The person running the cash register wore a t-shirt, and not a military jacket.  Now, don\\'t get me wrong. The Food Co-Op was still awesome. The food options were great and the service was friendly. However, I couldn\\'t tell if my memories were incorrect. I was pretty young at the time (12-13), so my mind could have made certain details a lot more grand.

We both registered our devices (His laptop  PS4, my own HP 2560p laptop) on connect.umd.edu, and it worked earlier yesterday, but for some odd reason it's not working anymore.

First off, I know the common answer to waitlist classes are \"it depends what the class is.\" For a big class like MATH240 the chances of me grabbing a spot be fairly good? The minimum position I\\'m in is 5 for that class and the maximum position is 8. The professor is the same throughout all the sections-- Vincent Lucarelli. Is he any good? I tried to check ourumd, but he doesn\\'t have a page. The other class I\\'m worried about is MATH246. The only professor open is Ronald Lipsman, and I don\\'t want to take him and I can\\'t due to schedule confliction. My minimum position for other professors that teaches this course are 13 and the maximum position is 26. Does that mean the chances of me getting this class is fairly slim?

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Basically, I had a pretty crappy first semester here at UMD, but I really think the school has a lot to offer and I'd like to give it some more time before I decide to transfer or drop out. First semester I didn't really make any friends or talk to anyone on my floor (partially because of my weird housing assignment) and I didn't join any clubs. Academically I think I am doing better, despite the lack of a declared major, but I'm so tired of feeling lonely and not being able to spend time with friends. I have a few potential clubs picked out, but I don't have a lot of strong interests, so I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and/or has any advice for meeting people or good general clubs to get involved in. Thanks in advance, and sorry for the wall of text. Edit: thank you everyone so much for your advice and kind words. I'll definitely be going to stampfest and I just might take you up on some of your offers and pm you :) <eos> \", '<bos> Is ASTR100/ASTR101 a manageable gen ed class?

I'm a freshman CS major who's applying to Smith for a second major in Finance next semester. I was wondering if it would be possible, or if any of you have heard of people working with Smith professors on different research projects.  I'd probably be able to help out with some sorts of statistical analysis, as I'm relatively familiar with R and excel. I'm not sure how common this is, which is why I'm asking over here.  Thanks. Edit: I'm definitely not as familiar with R and excel as those are who've taken upper level statistics courses, as /u/EricForman19 mentioned. Still, I'd be interested to find out what types of things I might be able to help out with within Smith itself, as I have a strong interest in Finance, as well as its crossover into Computer Science. <eos> \", \"<bos> I have to take 3 cs upper level courses next semester (and two random courses to fulfill credits, which I wouldn't mind recs for as well), and I wanted to hear your thoughts about what classes I should take, what the professors are like, and whether it's manageable. I definitely plan on taking OS next semester, so how is Jeffrey Hollingsworth for the class? I'm thinking of taking data structures too, but I'm probably not gonna go with Hugue(I don't have a death wish), so how is Larry Davis? I'm not sure what other CS course to take since many of them are either hard or if they're not, they seem to be poorly managed. I'm sure I'm probably wrong, but I can't seem to find a 3rd CS course that is not coding(since 412 and 420 will take care of that) but is also interesting and not too hard, so I'd appreciate any advice. I play on talking to my advisor during my appointment too, but I want to come in with a game plan first.  <eos> \", \"<bos> What's up with that?

I have checked CS-related clubs in orgsync.com, but (I may be mistaken) it looks like most of them are inactive.

Do you understand conditioning and convergence of random variables? Will you help me to understand these concepts as part of a fair trade?

It has been hard for me to make friends because my current dorm floor is not the most social, and other circumstances too. I would like to live somewhere I could socialize with others, however, I think I would be happiest in a place where I have a kitchen (diner food is not working with me, I can't do it anymore) and additional living space. If I were to live in an apartment style dorm, I worry that I'll have a hard time meeting new people. If I were to live in Oakland, I would be so far away from everything (except the gym and 251), but it's the nicest dorm on campus (along with PF).

Now on academic probation and with no clear sense of what I'd like to pursue major wise I was wondering what I'm looking at moving forward this semester. Can I still register for classes?

As stated in the title of this post, I just received my acceptance to UMD-College Park as a transfer to finish my B.S. in Physics (yay). Anyway, I currently live in Georgia, but am wanting to move up to Maryland. I have a medium-sized chocolate lab I'd like to be able to bring with me.

I was thinking of either adding the math major - statistical track, or the statistics minor. How doable is the double major, especially in 4 semesters (not including winter and summer sessions, which I will also be taking). I've already covered Math240, 241, and 246. I've heard the really tough courses are MATH310 and MATH410. Are the stat courses especially tough?

I have been looking at smaller SUVs (I liked my CRV). I like the idea of being able to move most (or all) of my stuff in my car since I will be moving a lot. I also do not want a large SUV as the gas mileage gets worse the larger it is and I don't have the need for that much space. There is no point in spending more money for something I don't need.

Math 140 with Steven Chadwick ENES140 with James Green ENEE200 with Nicole Mogul SOCY100 with Robert Pernick  CMSC131 will be pretty easy for me if I take it. Plenty of prior programming experience.

I\\'m 100% sure it is a dog because the sound is extremely erratic. Plus, you know how dogs do that thing where they kinda just run around a room when they\\'re bored? It sounds exactly like that. It\\'s definitely not footsteps or anything. I can even occasionally hear the dudes voice and his acoustic guitar, but that\\'s not an issue for me as much as the dog is. It\\'s almost exclusively above my room or the living room, but it occasionally (about once a week) wakes my roommates up as well. I\\'ve been dealing with this all semester.   In SCC we also have RAs, and I\\'ve asked the RA\\'s to deal with this multiple times and nothing came out of it. The first time the upper floor RA said there was no dog, but also that there were no registered service/support dogs on that floor. One of the times I woke up at 7 AM because of it, I went and woke up the RA on my floor to see it himself. He came to my room and heard it (and admitted it was super loud and unpleasant) and then went upstairs and apparently didn\\'t find anything. I think this is because they hid the dog in someone\\'s room because right after I got a text from the RA, my roommate woke up and started complaining about the \"dog\".   I think it\\'s the guy above me\\'s girlfriend\\'s dog because it\\'s actually not here all the time, just about half the time. I can also occasionally hear a woman\\'s voice upstairs, and that makes it so much harder to catch.   Terps, what do I do? I want to handle this in a reasonable and mature way but I also really, truly, from the bottom of my heart just want to sleep uninterrupted by a dog of all things. <eos> ', '<bos> I was going to do the enrollment deposit but it said mine was waived.

Basically I'm trying my hardest to get on campus housing for this upcoming fall semester but the person on the phone told me that I'm in position 103 (iirc).

I've returned this semester after graduating from MC (Associates) with 3.9~ and spending a semester at another univ (4.0).  My academic past haunts me here. Having already attended means that I cannot access the vast majority of scholarships/grants (that I've found thus far), and having a crap GPA from years ago essentially blocks me from getting any other UMD based help that I might otherwise be able to apply for.

I've heard 141 is horrible though and as a freshman, I'm somewhat terrified and want to do decent the first semester. Is there a major difference between 141 and 141H?

I came into college thinking that I would eventually just declare English as a major, but I realized that I actually hate reading (I only really like writing) and that the major is notorious for churning out jobless grads/teachers so I figured I should stay away. I've gone through many phases of majors that I would declare, anthropology, french, art, film studies even (I know, I know, I like majors with no job prospects apparently :P), but I don't feel 100% about any of them. I love art, but I know that I can't just major in art (or at least I don't want to), so ideally I want a major that my art interest/skills can be an asset to. Recently I've been thinking about something along the lines of Comm (the PR track) or Journalism (Multimedia) because I feel like I might be able to blend my love of art with them and still seem marketable in the job world (maybe work at some sort of art place doing PR work or a magazine). Anyway -- my question is to anyone who has any experience with either of these majors, what do you think I should go for? What are the big differences in job prospects/curriculum/schools in general?

Maryland looks really appealing to me because of the strength of the CS/CE programs together with the honors math program, especially the 340/341 sequence, which seems to be unique (in having a theory-oriented, starting-at-calc-3 class aimed at freshman) among schools of this caliber (that I can feasibly get into/afford; I only looked into the math programs of schools I'm already considering.).

[But I certainly wouldn't say no to food/alcohol]) With the end of July coming around, many leases in the area are ending. I'm fortunate enough to have my lease extended so I'm immune to the moving woes of the season. With work slowing down in the next few weeks, I'd like to get out and active more lest I fall victim to the current Steam sales.  I do not have a car or truck so this offer is strictly for manual labor. I can be anywhere the UM Shuttle goes but I'd be willing to take Metro/Metrobus if absolutely need be.

I just turned 24 and was hoping there are on campus grad student dorms I would be able to be placed in or just housing that is offered through the school to someone my age. It would certainly be easier for me to apply that to my student loan than find off campus housing to worry about. 2) so although I'm done with my first two years I know at least 50-55 of my 68ish credits will transfer I know for a fact I need General Physics I, can anyone recommend a professor?

What is the acceptance rate for people trying to switch to engineering? 2) If I apply as an engineering major and I switch to comp sci later, is it possible for me to switch back to engineering if I change my mind again? 3) Is it possible to double major with some kind of engineering AND computer science?

The avg was at a 77, but after dropping the lowest quiz grade and dropping some clicker quizzes, I'm guessing the average went up to an 80? I still ended up with a B-, so for those of you taking 330 next semester, do NOT expect a curve more than 2 or 3 points... Its weird.. I swear I had a higher curve in 132 going from a B+ to an A-. Our first midterm avg was a 75 and the second midterm avg was a 59. I had Anwar, who wasn't necessarily a bad teacher, but knew how to make tricky and tough questions. For people taking 330 next semester, make sure you practice a lot of coding problems, maybe look at hackerrank. They ask a lot of questions about reversing/modifying lists in Ruby, OCaml, and Prolog. Also, projects are 40% of your grade! The projects are very hard, so make sure you start early. I got mostly A's except for the first 7% project one which I got around a C+. So make sure you study just as hard for the tests as well. Practice your speed and do not expect a curve. Even if TA's or the teacher says you might get a curve more than 3 points, that means nothing as long as the class avg is borderline C+. My TA told me I'd probably have a 4 point curve, but I ended with 1-2 points and the same letter grade. Again, expect nothing and work on your programming skills.

My advisor recommended me to take CMSC132 in the summer this year, but I might have to do something else over the summer.  **EDIT: I forgot that you can't take 132 and 216 together, so the updated question is how necessary it would be to take 132/maybe 250 over the summer rather than taking 132 and 250 in the fall and 216 in the spring.** <eos> \", '<bos> I was walking home about an hour ago on Yale Ave and a silver van with four guys drove past me yelling things like \"Are you on girls gone wild?\" and other obscene things.

I'm a Michigan State fan visiting for the football game this Saturday and was hoping to get some tips to make the best of the experience. - What are the best options for parking? I found [this parking map]([url link] that has a few options for pre-pay parking at $17, but the site also mentioned that parking on campus, at meters, and at the metro station are free. Is it possible to find decent free parking or is the pre-pay the way to go? If so, does it matter much which lot I select? - Do a lot of people tailgate in the pre-pay lots? Are there other major areas for tailgating? Do the bars around campus get pretty packed during pre-game? What are good bars to visit if we want to hang out, and maybe catch some of the earlier games in the day? - Any suggestions for anything on or around campus worth seeing while we're in town?

After about 2.5 years, I finally mustered the courage to make an appointment a few months ago. It turned out to be a really terrible experience - the intake counselor was very cold, interrupted me numerous times, and at two different points during the meeting he ACTUALLY said \"You know, I don\\'t really see a problem here. I\\'m not sure what you came in for/why you\\'re here\". Sure, my problems are not as heavy as others (it\\'s all relative), but it still really, really hurt to hear that. I got a weird vibe from him early on so I didn\\'t delve deep into the topics I wanted to discuss. There are some other things that he also said that I did not appreciate and made me feel worse, but I won\\'t discuss them now.  At the end of the appointment we was trying to pressure me into deciding how to continue; whether I wanted to do group therapy (which we kept pushing) or if I wanted to see a psychologist. I ended up leaving without making a decision, primarily because I was so turned off by the intake meeting and the counselor.  I\\'m here to ask my fellow Terps what they suggest. I\\'ve tried the Help Center and they\\'re really fantastic, although I\\'ve found that they listen more than they give advice, and I really need some guidance and advice.

Let's say a student is a due-paying member of the KKK, but is really nice and civil to anyone on campus and never actually has any negative incidents on campus, or any crimes off campus. They're just a member. They haven't gotten arrested, been identified at events, or anything like that. They're just a due-paying member. So could a student technically get kicked off campus or out of housing just for being a member, even if they haven't actually broken any rules? We're just curious, and had a debate about this. Technically, it could be considered joining any other activist party, right? Totally random, and completely theoretical. None of us actually want to join the Klan, I promise! But really, could they?

Knowing all of this, does anyone remember the order that the books are covered in the course? I'm taking the course with Francisco Barrenechea, if that helps. If you don't remember what the books are, the list is as follows:  - *Essential Homer* (Homer) - *Medea, Hippolytes, Heracles, Bacchae* (Euripedes) - *Anthology of Classical Myth* (Trzaskoma) - *Classical Mythology: Very Short Intro* (Morales) - *Metamorphoses* (Ovid) - *Sophocles I* (Sophocles)  <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm a little confused on how on-campus housing works.

I really only decided to enroll here because it was cheap (using the GI Bill for in-state tuition, I'm actually making a profit going here) and near home. However, I'm considering transferring to somewhere out of state with a more prestigious CS program like University of Maryland. However, some of the things I'm concerned about are: * Difficulty of school: I finished my first year fairly well at a 3.5 GPA and thought my courses were on the easier side, but I'm worried if I transfer to somewhere with a more rigorous program I won't be able to keep up. * Cost: Out of state tuition is insane, and I'm afraid the GI Bill won't be able to cover it- I'm avoiding student loan debt like the plague. * Social life: I usually keep to myself and I'm alright with being alone, but moving away from friends and family might get to me after a while. I haven't talked to anyone about considering this, as I don't want them to think I'm leaving when I have yet to come to a decision.

Before I say anything else, I fully and completely understand that I brought this on myself, so please don't give me shit over this.  I am a freshman in the CS program here, about to enter my second semester in the Spring. During the fall in 131, I gave a friend my code to help them on the projects. He returned the favor to me throughout the semester by giving me programming advice (not actual code) on how to approach the projects. But then at the very end of the semester, he ends up having an exact copy of my coding implementation in a couple of the 131 projects (He sent me his code out to me out of fear after seeing an email about cheating from the professor). He told me that he admitted to everything to the professor via email, but I have yet to do so.

I have just recently moved about 10 mins away from campus (walking) after having lived across the street from campus previously, so I think I need a bike.

I took Ap NSL in high school and my score was a 3 so I have to take Gvpt170. I’m wondering if that will be a waste of time or alot learning new stuff.

As a result, I'm right on the failing line for a math class of mine that's required for my major. I could technically take an entire withdraw with the situation going on right now; however, I am doing pretty well in my other classes and I don't really want to lose progress. If I drop the math class I'll be at 12 credits so thats not an issue either. I suppose I'm asking for advice on how bad a W in a major required course looks. I was planning on possible grad school so would a W ruin my chances ? Would it be ok if I acknowledged and explained it? And as a side note, would it be better to stick it out and (possibly) fail rather than take a W? My GPA is relatively high so I'd rather not ruin it. Any advice is appreciated!

I have many friends who came in through freshman connection, but I feel as though the university is doing a massive disservice to them but admitting people who aren't of the same calibre as regular admit students that take the same classes.  Now don't get me wrong, some of my best friends I've made in UMD have been through freshman connection, but they are the same people that are going through academic probation, getting kicked out of their major, having disciplinary problems, or even just wasting a lot of time trying to get into an LEP that won't accept them. I'm not saying that all freshman connection admits do this, but they a lot of them are struggling to keep up in classes, not to mention the stigma of getting in through freshman connection as well. Additionally, they lower the rankings of the schools. UMD is too big already tbh (40,000 students wtf); if they just cull all the freshman connection students, we'd be a higher ranked school. It's not like they wouldn't have anywhere else to go, freshman connection usually yields a UMBC or Towson admit, right? <eos> \", '<bos> -am male <eos> ', '<bos> So I just transferred to UMD from a community college and I began to major in comp sci.

I really can't stand Maryland's system in which class percentage dictates whether or not you graduate with honors. It's not that it's a terrible means of judging - it's just most universities go by a set GPA threshold (e.g., 3.8 is magna cum laude). The reason I'm asking this is because I graduate this semester, and while my GPA is fairly high, I'm not sure if I'll be able to graduate with honors. I guess I need too depend on my colleagues to do poorly relative to myself.

Meeting people in my dorm never happened freshman year because there was this weird expectation that I was supposed to hang out with other girls which doesn't work for me. And I kind of hide in all my classes.  So I met people through a video game I used to play competitively: In The Groove (similar to DDR). Stamp used to have this awesome dedicab (basically really good hardware to play the game on). I played it a lot and we had tournaments and stuff. I made some really close friends on campus. They were all older than me. And then they got rid of the machine for a really crappy upgrade cab so I stopped meeting people that way. And then they all graduated. And today is the first day that I officially don't feel like I know anybody on this campus again. So if you were a Junior and had three semesters left and all of your close friends graduated and moved really far away, what would you do? I have a pretty narrow range of interests. I'm a math  CS double major, I like music and puzzle video games and I run a lot. I also like food. That's about it. Occasionally I pick up new interests, like recently I've gotten into Dominion and nethack. I've tried to join some clubs here, but I got super bored and stopped showing up.

I have two questions, gonna ask the natural sciences one first because it\\'s more important. I\\'m taking GEOL100 right now for my natural sciences lab. It was a bit overwhelming at first (because the HW is awfully programmed and tends to be a bit too in-depth compared to the exams) but I\\'ve gotten the hang of it.

I am scheduled to take CMSC 250 next semester, and CMSC 216 the semester after. The only issue is that I'm a math major. Thus, I already know most of the topics of CMSC 250 from Math 410, Math 310, and Stat 410. Should I just test out of CMSC 250? My only concern is that, if I do test out of CMSC 250, then I will have to take CMSC 216, Math 411, and Math 405 concurrently next semester. That doesn't sound like fun. Another option may just be to take the H-version of CMSC 250, so I don't get bored out of my mind. Any advice?

Sorry for another housing question, I know everyone's been asking but I can't find an answer to this particular question.  How soon can I secure housing?

To start off, I have always been a Grade A student throughout my time before college. IB student in high school so I'm actually used to the workload that college has presented me. That being said I decided to major in Electrical Engineering after my first year because I have been told that Engineering was a very efficient major to go into if I wanted a high-pay job. I have many concerns ever since. Note that I have never done anything related to Electrical Engineering. At first the experience was not too overwhelming since I did not partake in any actual ENEE classes since I was still finishing up pre-requisites for those classes. After that semester was done, I enrolled in some ENEE classes and at first I thought the major was doable. I found myself not really interested in learning about circuits (ENEE205) although learning how to program (ENEE140) was definitely a new experience that I enjoyed. I didn't do too well but I was sliding by with B's and C's. This semester however I have struggled to understand a lot of the subjects that I've been taught. Programming became almost undoable (ENEE150 with Hawkins) but I was told from everyone to stay in because no one ever fails if they just try. I am failing to understand circuits (ENEE303) as much as I did before and have come to a point where I may have to take a W (drop out of the class). I am not struggling to grasp digital logics (ENEE222) at all because I have no interest in what the professor is trying to teach and even though I believe I have spent many hours studying/reviewing for the course, I still cannot understand it nor keep myself interested in what the professor has to say. This being said I am doing horrible in the class. I know this is rant but I need some help or someone with similar experience on this situation. I am cornered to deciding whether I still want to continue EE and drop some courses and hopefully understand them next time, or simply changing majors because I feel like I cannot seem to make myself become interested in the topics I am presented. I have many friends that have been trying to convince me to stay with it because I am already in my junior year of college and if I changed now I would have to basically restart and attend additional years in college which is not my optimal plan.

I understand that I need to complete Calc, Stats, and Intro to Accounting, but is it okay if I am in the middle of completing one of the gateway courses (stats) during the time that I am applying (in fall 2018)?

Is it possible to take Math for Econ as a gateway instead of calc? It has the same difficulty as calc (maybe harder) and is accepted as credits, but idk if it's equivalent.

We like quiet and people who are chill, but we are always up for a good impromptu fiesta. Our majors are Spanish/Education and Computer Science. We both cook our own food, and our living room has a LOT of food shelves, so if you would like to room with us it would be preferable if you enjoyed food a lot too. Roommates who cook are always welcome. We also like people who are weird (like enjoy listening to porn for the blind, reading strange fanfiction pairings, and laughing at other people's Facebook pictures).  We are not incredibly neat. Don't get us wrong, we aren't DIRTY, but we're messy. The common area will probably always be artfully almost-neat-but-still-messy but we leave ample comfortable space to sit, walk and eat. We don't drink, smoke, or party. Don't really care if you do as long as it's not in the apartment and there's no vomiting. We do have boyfriends who will occasionally visit and possibly stay overnight, but we're considerate and it likely won't happen very often. If you have a SO, they are welcome in our apartment as long as they clean up after themselves and you guys are also considerate! Major note: We like to talk out any problems, so we need a roommate who can be open and say what they need to say. Passive aggressiveness is the worst. Just be chill.

For example, I am more comfortable with Java (I'm no expert with Java) than I am with Python. If the interviewer asks me something complex about Python or about other languages on my resume, and I unsurprisingly don't know the answer at all, how should I respond?

Unfortunately, this lined up with my time as a graduate student at UMD. Regardless, I have been able to fulfill all of my assistantship duties to the best of my ability, but the treatment has put me behind in my coursework. Thus, I am still ineligible to move into candidacy, and will require a fourth year.  My assistantship covers five credits every semester, and expires after three years, which is the expected duration of the degree program. Next year, I will be paying out-of-state tuition on the remainder of my degree, which I had not anticipated, and will likely be very hard to afford.  I asked if the remaining two credits could be put towards my university fees, which add up to over $1000 (for this semester alone), and was told that \"there is no mechanism\" that can transfer the funds. The value of the credits is almost exactly the same, maybe even a little bit more. Would it be that terrible for the university to waive the fees?

I'm a junior computer science student who just transferred into UMD and I'm I feel like I'm falling a little behind compared to my school mates. This week has been busy with all sorts of companies coming to recruit interns for their companies and I feel a bit left out. I have some experience in computer science outside of school and I'm currently in CMSC132. I love programming and have a great passion for computer related stuff. Even though CMSC132 is a bit of a tough course, I enjoy every bit of it and I'm looking forward to learn more programming skills outside of school. During high school I was modding games and doing basic scripting and during my freshman year in a community college I developed my own android game and published it on Google Play. Even though its not a sophisticated game, I feel proud of creating it. ([url link]  I know I have a lot more to learn and develop more skills to be in par with many computer scientists here. My game plan is to learn more about computer science and all the related stuff during my junior year and then start focusing on internships and such during my senior year. Is this proper? Will companies look down on me for beginning my internship during senior year, or even after graduating?  I'm sorry for sounding so simpleminded but I'm just clueless and the transfer experience for me has been a bit daunting. Also, any tips on what companies look for on the resumes? Can I put basic skills that I have. Over the summer I learned basic HTML, CSS, and also SQL programming, not anything extensive though. Is it worth putting things like this?

There are meters outside of Prince Frederick Hall with a sign that say they're good daily from 7:00AM to Midnight. I parked at one, and went to pay for a half hour, and it let me. These are digital meters, and they can be set to not accept fares at certain times of day, but this one wasn't. It wasn't until I had dropped my stuff off in my room and got back to my car to find a ticket, and saw a sign that contradicted the meters, saying those spaces were for state vehicles only on weekdays during day time hours. Everyone knows that dots is brutal, and I was trying to comply with the rules, I shouldn't have to make sure that there aren't signs anywhere around that contradict ones that say I can park. A meter shouldn't take my money if I'm not allowed to park there at that hour.

I had always been passionate about it and I would be studying at a university in D.C. so I thought it would be perfect for me. Fast forward to spring semester freshman year: I decided to take an astronomy course to fulfill a general education requirement and immediately fell in love it. I had also always had a passion for astronomy as well. I loved it so much that I decided to transfer here to pursue a major in astronomy. I also decided to pick up a major in physics since I was told it was crucial to have if I wanted to go on to grad school. Fast forward to present time, second semester sophomore year: I've almost completed my first semester as a physics major and it's been the most depressing semester so far. I was never great at math in high school, and so now I'm barely managing a C- in Calc 1. The more I read about what physics majors do during and after college the more I'm starting to think I may have acted on pursuing this new program too quickly without doing enough research. My GPA is most likely going to drop from a 3.8 to maybe a 3.0 if I'm lucky. Even though I love astronomy, I don't see how I can continue this for another three years; I just don't think I have the brains for it. I don't even know if the research environment is right for me. I've even dropped all my physics courses for next semester and am looking at pursuing a government and politics major, which is basically what I was doing at my old university. Should I try to give it another semester or should I just continue with what I set out to do in college in the first place with my government major? I also want to still graduate on time and study abroad, and with a physics and astronomy double major I would be graduating a year later at the earliest assuming I don't study abroad.

Compared to UMBC\\'s program(which I am still considering, as they gave me a 10K/year scholarship [w/no honors college]), what advantages does UMD\\'s program have above the competition? Also, does being a \"small fish in a big pond\" make it harder to compete for internships and the likes? Or do most students get an internship by means of the program reputation and connections?

The prices are just too good to pass up. But the 'service' is just about enough to make me forget about this school like I vowed to when I graduated.  Let's start with football.

I get the passes and they say 9B on the front, give the guy a call and he says it was his mistake, but it should work in 9B, 11C and a all of the permit lots. I roll with it since the passes were on a discount. First game comes and guess what, I can't park in 11C. (Makes sense from the parking pass, but not from what I was told by the box office). Really not a big deal, but why can't they get their shit straight.  Now onto basketball season. I once again bought season tickets(not for parking this time). Ticket transfer seems easy enough, either I pay $5 or the other guy pays $5 and I can transfer the ticket. So I am walking a guy through this ticket transfer process and I tell him I will pay the fee for the ticket. Everything goes great. Until UMD packs on another fee for him to print his ticket that isn't mentioned anywhere before this point. Well shit, now this guy is pissed and probably thinks I am trying to pull something over on him. Talked to the ticket office and they said that is just how it is.

Is Scholars more helpful in the long run (think resumees, recognition over doing no special programs) or more of a waste of time, especially since I may double major? 3.

Coming to this university I expected open parties left and right. I thought that any given thursday, friday, and saturday, I would be able to walk down college and find at least 4 open parties. Inevitably, I was disappointed that people would be so exclusive, that people would be so content with the shitty bars (and yes they are shit). But last night, parties were open, people were included. It wasn't about being a fratstar or a GDI...it was about raging.  Gentlemen, this year has been an ABORTION for Maryland. Maryland will soon get the reputation that people here simply do not know how to party if we do not change things now.  So next year I challenge you. Fraternities and GDIs alike, RAGE HARD. Throw bangers. Let girls and guys in to said parties. Show the nation that Maryland is not a college full of pussies.

I'm currently crossed on wether I should go for the 5 yr. masters here or apply outside. I want to study deep learning / genetic algorithms.  Any former students from UMD who got into top masters programs have any advice for applying outside? / what kind of stats are required (GPA / research / how important is comp sci gpa? ...). The thing is my overall gpa is exactly a 3.5, with mostly Bs (also 2 B- (351 ;) ) and a C+ in a number theory course (math 406) ... should probably retake that...) in my CS courses so I don't know how hard it would be for applying to outside masters schools. I already know the requirements for phD programs, but I can barely find any info on CS masters admission requirements. In terms of chances, I might be a special case since I transferred from UIC (lesser known) 2 years ago with a 3.7 (both comp sci + biology major) gpa there.   The reason I'm not considering phD yet is because I didn't get much research experience so far and my CS grades aren't high enough. Some people told me to just go for the 5 year masters here, increase my GPA, and then try for phD. But I still want to know my chances of getting into outside masters, assuming I could maybe increase my gpa (~3.55 - 3.6) by next semester and do well on the GRE.  Edit: I noticed other UMD undergrads would probably be wondering as well. Especially those who have less than 3.5 who have no choice but to apply outside. A thread like this would be pretty helpful.

I just wanted to let you know about a Google Chrome extension that allows you to help out others without any extra effort on your end! Tabs for a Cause allows you to earn hearts with every tab you open on Chrome - you can pool these hearts and donate them to a charity of your choosing.

In terms of setup, environment, what it looks like, opportunities (i.e. are recruiters mostly looking for school-year interns, summer interns, part-time employees, full time?), etc. Is it open to freshman?

I'm looking to do some video editing and my current laptop is very underpowered, so I'd imagine even simple video editing will be a really frustrating experience.

I honestly hate math (not to offend anyone) and am at the moment barely tolerating AP Calc BC. It's not that I'm bad at it, I'm average, but I just don't like it. 2.

One of our sister institutions in the University System of Maryland, Bowie State University, will hold its spring commencement in the Comcast Center and Mrs. Obama has agreed to be the commencement speaker. We are proud and excited to host the First Lady on our campus. Please note, however, that this is NOT a UMD event. Approximately 14,000 guests are expected to participate in the Commencement, therefore we should all prepare for significant traffic delays. This event will increase campus traffic during an already busy day. Friday, May 17 is both the last day of final exams and the final move-out day for students.  To try and reduce the traffic impact on that Friday, we are asking students to move their belongings out of their residence hall space by 10:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 16, if at all possible. Students with finals on this day should allow extra time for travelling to and from their exams. Detailed information will be forthcoming this week from the Department of Transportation Services regarding suggested travel routes and designated parking locations for the day.  Thank you in advance for your patience. Sincerely, Mary Ann Rankin Senior Vice President and Provost  <eos> ', \"<bos> Everyone here seems to have received their housing assignments for the 2017-2018 year.

As we walked through the floor, we both wanted to gag because the smell was so strong. Is it ALWAYS like this, or did we happen to go when some smelly individual stank up the whole floor?? Obviously the semester hasn't started yet so we couldn't blame it on some freshman who hadn't showered since they left home or something trivial like that but it made me curious if it's just always like that?

My grades are slipping a little bit and I was wondering at what point UMD would take away a scholarship from an incoming student with poorer grades than what they applied with.

I am an international student from India who recently got accepted to the university of maryland college park for cs. I just wanted to know how good the program is and had a few questions.

I live in Pikesville and from what I understand it would take 1 hour every day to commute to college park. That's if I'm lucky and there is no traffic. How long can it take with traffic? How long do you generally commute to UMD? Should I just rent somewhere near campus? I'm finishing my last year in community college and I realy want to transfer to UMD and I have grades to do so but this commuting problem is just scary. It would take so much of my free time and money to commute.  Another question I wanted to ask is if UMD is THAT MUCH BETTER than towson? Towson is literally 10-12 minutes away from me. I'd also graduate at least 1 semester earlier from Towson because of prereqs. My major is Information Systems in Towson and either Information Systems or Information Science(if I dont get accepted into business school) in UMD.  <eos> \", '<bos> I am currently at sophomore at a liberal arts college. I\\'m supposed to graduate in 2014 with a BA in CS and probably a second major in math. It\\'s nice here, but I recently found out that my parents will be expecting me to pay them back for the last two years of tuition after graduating (ouch). Maybe turning down instate tuition and merit scholarships at UMD was not such a good idea.  Between AP credits and classes here, a lot of general education requirements should be taken care of, but it looks like the core gets pretty specific and will not be fully satisfied. Edit: At this point, am pretty sure I will need to take one each from: History or Theory of Arts, Diversity, and Professional Writing. Since I only decided that I wanted to major in CS last semester, this is what I will have taken if I start at UMD Fall 2012: 1. Intro CS - recursion in Java. 2. Fundamentals of CS aka \"so you think you want to be a CS major\" - surveys lots of CS topics, mostly in SML but also Python, C, and a simulated assembler. 3. Logic and Computability - pure theory, no code whatsoever 4. Data Structures - Java and C++ The last two are next semester. With these classes coming in, do you think I could graduate in two years with a degree in CS? If it takes three years, the cost difference would go from 60k to 35k with one less year to make money after, so it will probably not be worth doing. <eos> ', \"<bos> My room gets ridicously hot for my comfort zone. It's at a temperature of 78-81 averagely. It's not as hot that in the living area, or roommates rooms (I presume), so someone often has the AC set on 70-75 (which doesn't cool off my room well at all). Back at my parents house/farm the temp was set at 70-72. Colder in some rooms. I have a box fan and desk fan, which helps to a degree but isn't doing the trick. Opening a window doesn't really help. I can leave the door open but not when I sleep. I live on the corner so I have two windows which radiate with heat. The BIG factor is the electronics in my small room. I have my desktop rig (off whenever possible), and the big factor of a mini fridge. I believe the mini fridge is putting off a ton of heat for my small room. Waking up to 81 degrees sucks. So I was wondering if anyone had some experience with a portable window ac unit that has a air duct to the window. Since the windows don't open that much, I was seeing if anyone had a compatible verison they know of. I'm just not comfortable (waaah).

They're still in CP proper but I'm talking about places in Hollywood near Shoppers or REI, or in College Park Woods. These houses are cheap and spacious and nice but damn some of them are far removed. Anyone here live in those areas without a car? Do you find it bearable? I'd be living relatively close to a ShuttleUM stop so at least I'd have that. This year I was lucky enough to have a roommate who lets us borrow her car but I may not get so lucky next year.

I was leaning more towards Information Systems, but it's a Limited Enrollment Program in Business School so I might be not accepted. I'm also VERY concerned that they literally have zero programming classes. From what I understand, Information Systems is between business and Computer Science so ideal would be half of the courses in business and half in programming. Zero classes in CS is just very weird. I'm afraid I won't learn any practical skills there. I've done a little research and in other colleges practically all InfoSys Curriculums do have programming classes.  Information Science does not have limited enrollment, but, from what I understand, most people go there when they can't handle Computer Science. I'm afraid that literally every employer will look down on this major. I also don't like the fact that a lot of employers and alumnis work in Libraries. I have no interest in working in Library whatsoever. I'm just afraid that most employers will pick CS major instead of IS without thinking twice. Information Science has a lot of classes that I think can teach me valuable skills, including a couple of CS classes, and their Data Science Specialization looks interesting as well. No business courses at all though. I'm concerned that many employers just have no idea what Information Science degree means. IS/CIS/MIS is becoming more and more popular, but very few colleges have Information Science degrees.  Can you please advise me what to do in this situation? I'm really confused. Ideally, I'd like to work as business analyst or project manager and the salary aspect is very important for me. What is the average salary for fresh grad in these majors? What is the average intern salary?  Thanks! <eos> \", \"<bos> I've worked since the start of the semester at the north campus dining hall, mainly at sprouts and at the ice cream station. I have a few things that my co-workers and I would like to say.  Please don't get angry at us for long lines when there is only one of us manning the station. We are trying our best, and oftentimes our equipment is half broken. For example the grill at Sprouts last week had a massive problem with heat and I could only use a third of the grill for stir fry. This made a huge line for stir fry and many people got angry even though I explained to them that the grill was mostly broken. Not to mention that the grill is usually insanely hot. Last week a coworker got a 2nd degree burn from one of the grills so we gotta be careful.  If you placed an order for something, please don't walk away for more than a minute. This only aggravates us and wastes our time as we (well, at least I was) have been told to make an effort to find the person before moving on. I cannot tell you how often I've worked at Sprouts and some idiot places an order then leaves for 10+ minutes, then comes back and complains why her order wasn't done yet. If you are not present, I will skip your order. I know that the lines can be long at times but you must understand that we are frequently short staffed and we will get to your order as soon as possible.  If you choose to get a milkshake past 11:45pm, we will not be happy about it.  If you spill something, please clean it up. There are napkins all over the tables and it would really help us if you just took a minute and cleaned up your mess. And for fucks sake put your trays on the conveyor belt! Too many times I've had to clean up people's trays, plates and cups from the tables. If you do this, fuck you, your parents must be so ashamed. Is it really that hard to clean up after yourself? Finally, speak up when talking to us! Especially at Global, Als grill, and Sprouts. The grill is especially loud, and you speaking like a mouse isn't doing anyone any good. Edit: also, there's something about the ice cream station that turns us into total assholes, so I apologize on behalf of all ice cream workers.  <eos> \", \"<bos> So I'm doing the fall 2015 app right now, but I have a couple of questions. 1) ~~Do we send in our AP scores?

I don’t have to file an appeal to stay in my major. A little awestruck that my academic career was in jeopardy due to someone simply forgetting to input transfer credits.. all in all, I’m happy things worked out.  I received an email today saying that I have not satisfied my second benchmark (calculus II) for my major (PHNB) so I have to change my major. I took calculus II at a different university during the summer 2017 session and made sure that it would be accepted at umd. It seems like there was a mishap between the transferring credits process and umd never received the transcript/proof of me taking the class last summer. If I have the transcript and show them, how likely is it that my appeal to stay a PHNB major will be approved? It seems like a big misunderstanding but I’m not sure how strict umd is about being kicked out of majors and I’m really worried.  <eos> ', '<bos> So Im really struggling with the new material in math 110.

Apparently, it's quite common in NYC in particular and mostly for the purpose of mitigating noise. (maybe to protect the floor too, but it's managed to remain in good shape after 70+ years) Nonetheless, does anyone have a suggestion on a local place to buy carpet remnants (or possibly rugs) for cheap? I'm guessing someone here has probably bought carpet to cover the floor in their residence hall room or apartment/house elsewhere. I'm just looking for something that will last a year and cover my floor without turning into tatters...nothing fancy at all. It's a studio apartment, so I need only one rug/carpet for the main area (flexible on dimensions, anywhere between 9x9 and 12x12). I'm not sure if a typical carpet store is really interested in customers who are just looking for a $100 piece of carpet...but i'd imagine there has to be a market for this sort of thing (especially near a university). Thanks for any advice! <eos> \", '<bos> so this is my first semester at umd as transfer student. I came in wanting to do computer science but now I have an interest in information systems but its in the business school.So I have to take the gateway courses. In order stay on a 4-year path to graduating I would need take accounting 1, and Bstats and calculus 1 by next semester. Is that too overwhelming? for one semester? and I am also thinking about greeklife. another thing is Ive never taken a stats course b4 or just anything relating to business am I setting my self up for failure? but at the same time I have minimal coding experience.  <eos> ', '<bos> Everyone in this sub should be proud of how they voiced their opinions and collectively made change happened. This is the cs chairs response: Dear Students: I am writing to let you know that the Computer Science Department is working hard to find the additional seats needed to meet demand for courses next semester.\\xa0 We are adding capacity to currently scheduled classes and also working with faculty to identify new sections of 400- level classes. This morning, we added 230 seats to existing classes.\\xa0 We will continually work to ensure the availability of classes for those students graduating in May/August of 2018.\\xa0  We ask for your patience as it will take some time to get all of this accomplished. We will need\\xa0to ensure proper space for classes\\xa0and we will also need you to\\xa0coordinate registration with your academic advisors. If we determine that we still haven’t met demand for seats, then we’ll create more capacity.\\xa0 It has been a real challenge to offer enough seats for so many talented\\xa0and\\xa0eager students,\\xa0and the Department will work hard so that you may make timely progress towards graduation.  We have heard your concerns, and we thank you for voicing them as you have. Please enjoy your Thanksgiving break.

Any advice for studying for it? This class seems pretty intense, and the amount of notes we have is way larger than most 400x classes I've taken, including 417.

I was so excited to go to UMD next spring but apparently I need to fulfill 9 different criteria(licence, lease etc) for 12 months to pay in state tuition. I will miss the 12 month mark by around a month. Did anyone else successfully overcome similar residency problems? Also, what are some of the ways to reduce in state tuition? If it comes around 1.5x in state tuition I would be happy to apply for fall semester as a transfer student.  <eos> ', \"<bos> I registered for ENGL398N with Rebecca Holden during the registration period. Turns out I'm actually registered for ENGL398N with David Todd. My questions are: 1) Is there any chance the department switch the instructors/sections around?

There are two reasons I believe that I didn't get my LEP. 1. Too many credits or 2. Not all pre requisites filled. I have a 3.8 gpa and 90 credits coming in, but I only switched to Engineering a year ago. Most of my credits are general education requirements. The only reason I think that the pre requisites weren't met is because I haven't done chemistry. However, physics and calc are mostly finished. So, to the point... anyone out there have a similar situation? Has anyone ever been accepted to their backup degree, but then able to apply and transfer to their desired LEP?

Parking passes are going for upwards of $125+ on Stubhub, and the Parking Panda site that MT directs you to isn't very helpful. Any insight?

            " ur gonna die I’m sorry mate Looooooook some idiot is going down the eviscerator. 18 credits is difficult, especially considering the classes you’re taking. I would drop stat or one of the math classes. If Justin is teaching 241, I would keep it. Yeah I have to say that this is an extremely tough schedule just because of the completely new material that you’ll be learning in linear and 132. Not to say that those classes are impossible they take together, but putting them with calc 3 and stat is kinda asking for someone to make your asshole so exposed that anyone can take advantage of it at a moment’s notice. Linear actually requires reading the book to figure out the logic and very little computation compared to calc and 132 just takes time due to the nature of comp sci work. I’d suggest dropping one or two courses.  \n"

Would i bring a ninja blender?? or a blender bottle? and where would i clean my dishes and shit    I would bring a ninja blender. I think it's the best option.  If you put you in the laundry room you can actually do that, and if you clean out that the dishes are on your table. I took a ton of practice exams with this one.  If I am honest, if I clean up my dishwasher there is no way it can properly\n",

Let's say you have a ninja, bring a sponge and dish soap. Then was the blade and bottle in the bathroom sink.  I'll be looking for a gym bro next semester. Hit me up. If your dorm lacks a kitchen area, you can always just take your bottle with you into the shower.  \n"
