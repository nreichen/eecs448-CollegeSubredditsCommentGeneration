            "<bos> I am an intercampus transfer and there is orientation tomorrow and the day after. It's 2 days long. I don't feel like attending that long of an orientation, most other schools have orientations a day long especially for transfer students. Can I skip most of the orientation and just have the advising appointment? Or will that not work and they will place a hold to not let me sign up for classes? Can I have the 411 please. <eos> \n",

Today my cousin came to visit unannounced, and I told him he would be alright to park in a D spot for only a few minutes so he could check out my place. When we got back he had a $50 ticket for not having a permit. I felt bad and told him I would pay it since I told him he could park there.  I am just wondering what would happen if I don't pay the ticket. Since he had no permit, there is no way to track it to me, so I could not get billed. They got his license plate number and car description though. If it does not get paid, will they look him up based on this or just let it go assuming he doesn't get another ticket here? I got one last year for parking over the line in my spot, but was able to appeal it, but this one I don't think could be appealed since the car was blatantly parked without a permit, and it was clearly posted. Any advice is appreciated. I won't be heartbroken if I end up having to pay it, but I just am wondering what would happen if I do not. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> As you may know, there's a pretty big football game this weekend. Actually, it's probably the biggest IUFB game in the last 20 years. If IU can knock off Wisconsin on Saturday, they'll have the inside track for a berth in the B1G title game. If they can win that, Rose Bowl! I shouldn't need to tell anyone how historic that'd be. Whether you like football or not, this team has worked their asses off all year to represent IU and now it's our last chance this year to show them some love. These guys deserve a packed house, especially for the seniors.  So tell all your friends, wake up early, hit the bars, hit the tailgate, get rowdy and be in the game by noon to rock The Rock! Rose Bowl here we come! <eos> \n",

I got accepted into my in state schools (UNC Charlotte, Appalachian State) and of course they are much cheaper than IU. So is IU worth out of state money?

Looked out the window and there was an SUV in the circle drive that was flipped on it's side. It looks like the driver hit the brick formation near the driveway. It didn't look like anyone was seriously injured. Damn. Does anybody know anything else about this? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey friends. I'm a senior at IU Bloomington this semester, I've been at IUB my whole college career. My question is how do I sign up for an online spanish course that is offered out of IU East? I tried emailing my adviser but seeing as it's officially winter break, I don't think she's going to get back with me in time. The reason I'm interested in the online class is because I didn't pass HispS200 this semester and have to retake it, however, I already have my set schedule for next semester and I need to take it online. I did some research and found that IU East has Span-S200 (which is the equivalent) 100% online, but it won't let me register for it (I'm assuming because I'm enrolled at IUB). Please help, I need to take this class and I need to take it online and it has to be next semester or I won't graduate on time. TLDR: I need to figure out how to enroll in an online spanish course from IU East while I'm currently attending IU Bloomington. <eos> \n",

I'm a 21st Century Scholar, which apparently pays for $100 of the $300, but I'm not sure if I have to pay the other $200 now or if it gets put off for later or what.

Id like an active floor, with hopefully some people that like listening to music/hanging out. I'm not a huge partier but Im always down with smoking a little something something/drinking. Kind've a night owl too.  What should I do? Should I apply for housing, even if Im not certain? Is there a dorm Id fit in at? Where should I apply!  Thanks guys. <eos> \n",

Many of the lurkers on here have lived all over B-Town and I was just seeking advice on places to check out.  My hope is that this can be a thread for advice on great places to live, places NOT to live and why, etc. I do not wish for this to be a place for people to post ads looking for sub-leasers.  More specifically, I'm looking for 1-2 bedrooms (preferably one) at least as many bathrooms as bedrooms, W/D, relatively inexpensive ($300-$800/month/person), parking available and for guests, private entrance, proximity to campus can vary, but obviously in Bloomington.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi. I was just admitted to a graduate program here at IU, and I was wondering, how on earth am I going to pay for it? I took two years off after I finished my undergrad, and so far it looks like my only options are loans. I've looked at fellowships and the like, but those mostly seem geared towards current students who can get nominated and such. I've been doing a ridiculous amount of scholarship work, but those have mostly fallen through. I would continue to work, but I work 40 hours over the course of three days, and if I continue to do that my first semester, I'm afraid it'll destroy me. Am I missing some sort of obvious solution besides loans? Thanks for helping. <eos> \n",

I will be using it to ride to class which is not very far as I'm just off campus and the occasional ride around the city for leisure. Mountain bike is heavier/bigger and has thick tires, while the race/road bike is older, smaller, lighter, and has thin tires. Any advice? <eos> \n",

I'm in Kelley and am taking Finite Math, Creative Writing, Comp. in Business, Pre-Law, and Kelley Compass. I'm also living in the new dorm Rose, which apparently is very nice. I'm also very into stand-up comedy and improv, along with baseball. Obviously I'm nervous to start IU, so I just wanted to ask any current/former Hoosiers for any advice they can give a freshman.  Also I plan on getting drunk SOMETIMES. I'm not really into getting constantly trashed and being drunk on a Tuesday morning. Oh and also I want to join a fraternity. <eos> \n",

The cops took my grinder and magic flight box (vaporizer). I only had roughly .3g of weed which is about $4, but they didnt add possession of under an oz which is good.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello IU Reddit, I am a first year student at the Kelley School of Business, and I was given three charges over the weekend for personal Misconduct on University property for pushing over a trashcan in my hall and throwing a burnt Piece of paper in it (it was not lit when I threw it into it) one month ago. I was very angry at the time, I've been calm since then, and it was my first ever charge. I have to go to a judicial conference tomorrow, and I have no idea what will happen. I talked to a friend who had to go to a conference before for illegal drinking, and he said that I will be fine, but I don't know. Does anyone know what could happen? Will I be kicked out or lose my scholarship?  <eos> \n",

But, I already have my tuition paid for through 21st Century. If I get all of my direct costs paid for through Groups/Covenant, will my merit scholarship be applied to any extra costs (i.e. bigger meal plan, better dorm room, etc.)?

            "<bos> I am a senior in computer science at IUSB who spent my first 2 years at Bloomington campus before taking a year off then transferring to IUSB to save money on tuition.  I have some research projects and 2 decent internships, data science/viz and machine learning have been interests of mine for several years so I consider myself fairly knowledgeable for an undergrad. Python, R and related ML  scientific computing libraries (tensorflow, numpy/pandas, matplotlib, sklearn etc.) I've worked with Karst and other similar resources for ML purposes such as AWS EC2 instances.  With this masters I'm trying to improve my resume a bit and ideally go into something directly data science related instead of general software engineering. But if it just helps me get a higher paying job somewhere nice through IU career services that's also a perfectly acceptable outcome to me.  So my main question is how competitive is admissions to the program? Should I try to go for the online program? Or half and half online/on-campus option? Get myself an extra year or 2 of job experience? What's the typical accepted student profile? The soic website is uncharacteristically lacking in general info.  My cumulative GPA is a 3.1 something and I have no true work experience in the field. I have taken a couple practice GREs and gotten in the top 20th percentile range.

I'm aware of an issue where two gaming devices that are connected to the same router have issues with parties. I suspect this is a similar problem, but since we're on campus we can't access network settings to configure a DMZ or mess with ports. Has anyone else experienced this issue/can anyone help fix it?  Edit: My next idea is to try to connect one of the devices to IU Secure. Maybe getting the consoles on two different networks will help. This is the first time I've lived on campus and dealt with IU DeviceNet, so does anyone know if consoles can even be connected through Ethernet to IU Secure anymore? <eos> \n",

Toxic environments are not. What are some good women’s sports on campus that will be welcome to beginners and have friendly communities? Is it a sort of thing that you have to take as a gym class? I’d love to get involved with a team but have no idea where to start! I’m open to all kinds of sports, because I’ll be uncoordinated wherever I go.  Thanks! Go Hoosiers 💪 <eos> \n",

I thought it would be cool to get her gift cards to restaurants on or near campus for those nights she needs a break from dorm food. I don't actually know her, so I can't speak to her preferences. I was going to do Chipotle, but I think it would be better to get local student favorites. I need to be able to purchase online or from Chicago suburbs. Any ideas? Thanks for any help you can offer! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello all. I have a question regarding how does in state tuition work at Indiana University.  For some background information, my family and I are US Citizens, living in a foreign country. After applying to colleges and reviewing my options, I have committed to IU-Bloomington. As of now, I am an out of state resident, as my parents currently have no state residency. They are planning on moving with me to Bloomington, if not immediately, than at most in a few months. My question is, how soon after they move to Indiana can I claim in state tuition? Can it be right in the second semester? Or will it only be in the next year? If in the second semester, how do I go about claiming residency? Again, my parents don't have a state residency currently, so I am assuming that the process of actually gaining residency in Indiana should be fast.  Additionally, my family wants to move back to US, to settle there for at least ten to twenty years. If they get an apartment, and my parents get a job, do you think that after a year, after taxes are paid, we would be able to prove residency? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Seeing people ask about Wright and Read, I figure there are probably other incoming freshman curious about their dorms. May as well just have one place where they can compare dorms. I'll start. I lived in Foster last year and it was pretty good. I'll say it's probably the worst of the northwest neighborhood, but it has some perks. One pro is having Gresham cafeteria, Hoo Den, and the Crimson Creamery right outside your door. It's also very close to the SRSC (gym) and a short walk from Assembly Hall. There are definitely some cons though... laundry isn't as convenient as it is in some dorms, the bathrooms are community so they're generally trashed (at least on guys' floors), and it's probably gonna be loud most nights. <eos> \n",

For event details, registration, and other information, please visit: [url link] We’re happy to announce that Tourney voting is back. All early registrants can nominate up to 3 games they want to have be sponsored tourneys. There will be 4 official, prize supported tournaments, voted on by early registrants. Prize pools are generally about $100-$125. That aside, there are dozens of other games being played all the event, both in tournament fashion, and in casual play. The raffle prizes generally exceed $10k in value, and easily make the event more \"worthwhile\" than the tournament prizes do.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I made the mistake of slacking off a bit in high school and ended up getting just below the requirements for being a direct admit (3.68 GPA 1200 SAT) because I didn't know about direct admission at the time. It sounds like getting into Kelley and getting signed up for the classes you need is just so difficult and I just get the feeling that I might end up hating everything and not enjoying my experience at all. I'm wanting to major in Accounting, but I don't know much about accounting and I'm basically wanting that major based on the salary and high demand for the job.  I'm considering maybe switching to Informatics - Information Technology. I'm good/interested in computers and while I'm sure this degree isn't easy, it probably won't be as stressful as trying to get into Kelley for a job I'm not even sure I'd enjoy. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I was wondering about the language flagship program, specifically the Chinese one. I was researching the website for IU and there was some information but it was hard to come by some actual experience from other people in recent years. I was wondering if you guys could answer some questions if you know anything about it. How much extra work do you guys know would it take to do the language flagship and would it interfere with my other opportunities because I am a prospective Kelley student so I would like to be flexible but take all the advantages offered to me. Thanks very much, this sub is extremely helpful and I appreciate it. <eos> \n",

I was offered a 5k a year deans scholarship with my 29 ACT, but I retook the test and now have a 30 superscored.  This will get me into Kelley, but I was wondering if they will automatically reconsider my scholarship or do I have to email them asking for more money? And if so what are the chances they'll actually give me a better scholarship? Thanks.  <eos> \n",

Would IU accept CLEP credit? Even is taken by international students? I really want to find a way to save some cost that I think could be done self-study. Also I am inclined major in accounting. Also a good way to accumulate credits for CPA exam.  <eos> \n",

I am just having some general difficulties and it is beginning to be reflected in my grade. Is there anyone out there who could provide some help like once a week?

            "<bos> So I pulled an all-nighter last night because I needed to see a friend off at his shuttle at 6:50 AM. The shuttle took off from the Union so we were wandering around inside for a while. I decided to take a look at the campus architectural model by the elevators for the hotel (you should all know what the hell I'm talking about) and discovered something kind of ridiculous. Turns out IU has plans to extend Law Ln (north side of train tracks) to the part of 10th street that just crosses from the south side to the north side of the tracks. If you know the area I'm talking about, then you should know that this sounds like a really stupid idea. To come out at Law Ln onto 10th street would mean that you're trying to merge with a complete blind spot to your right. The best thing you could do is add a stop light which would increase congestion on 10th street to ludicrous proportions. The second piece of future construction I noticed was pushing Woodlawn further north, through the train tracks, and meeting at the bypass. This I don't have as big of an issue with except for the fact that to do this, they'd effectively be splitting Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium. I don't know about you guys, but I feel like there's just something incredibly wrong with that. Downvote if you wish, but I thought this is something all of us need to know, and maybe even discuss about bringing to the administration. tl;dr: More road construction meaning more congestion, and the splitting of two of our most iconic teams (maybe one of those teams is iconic for the wrong reason, but whatever it's still the idea). <eos> \n",

I really didn't like the campus and the atmosphere when I visited, but I chose it because it was in state and close to home. I really loved IU when I visited and feel like I made the wrong choice. Is the CS program any good at IU and is it worth it to transfer just because I liked the university as a whole better? There's no doubt I will have more/better opportunities at my current school.  <eos> \n",

Union doubles got filled up and we didn't get a chance to grab one, so we are left looking for other options.

            "<bos> You guys probably get these types of posts a lot so sorry about this, but it's been weighing on my mind recently.  I'm interested in business school (accountancy) and IUB obviously has an amazing business school.  I have a high Weighted GPA (4.4) and a high ACT score (35) but my UW drops really low, down to a 3.6. In addition, It would be really helpful if I could get aid given that I have an older brother who is in college without any aid whatsoever currently.  My current goal is to apply in early September so I can hopefully hear back around early October and take a load off of my shoulder regarding college. However, if I were to do that, I wouldn't be submitting recommendation letters.  Should I wait to submit my application so that I can get letters of recommendation or should I just submit my application after I feel like I have a decent essay?

I've made some tweaks to the syllabus that I think will make the course even better. I've also thought up a sexy new title: \"Cyborgs, Babe Scientists, and Hermaphrodites with Attitude: Power, Technology, Difference.\"   The course will now meet from 11:15-1:45 Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting 10/16.  I realize this is probably not ideal for most of you, schedule-wise, but I'd love it if some of you fine folks can join me!   <eos> \n",

Very few of my friends are still in town, and we tend to get opposite work schedules as I work days and they work nights.

I am from California and have been doing research all year about what school would be best for me.

I am definitely interested in going into business and I know Kelley has one of the best reputations around. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> [url link]  It's a silver Yamaha C3. It was taken from my apartment at 1st and Walker between 11am and noon today. C3s have a failsafe and cannot be started without the key. I did a walk around my neighbourhood as best as I could but it wasn't ditched anywhere. The thieves probably had a truck. I'm disabled following a surgery that didn't go well and cannot walk without pain. I require painkillers just to get to the bus stop. Without my scooter, I am homebound. Shittiest part is, today was supposed to be my first day at my new job after 5 months of being unemployed because of my knee. BPD has a report on file but, of course, don't really care if it gets found or not. If you see it - and it's only one of 2 silver C3s in Bloomington - please call them.  <eos> \n",

I'm from the St. Louis subreddit, where the word \"Hoosier\" actually means something very different, I've discovered.

I wonder if anyone has experience with 1) Heritage Apartments or 2) Lincoln Hill Apartments.  Heritage Apartments seem OK to me, but I'm not sure about their distance from the campus. Is it walkable from there to the campus, or is the transportation system reliable? And I'm planning to cook most of my meals, so I want to know if this place is convenient for grocery shopping. On the other hand, I couldn't find any review on Lincoln Hill Apartments. Does anyone know about this place or its owner, Grant Property? I'll really appreciate it if you can give any information or if you can recommend any other place with similar conditions and price (my budget is around 700$ maximum). Please advice. Thanks a lot! <eos> \n",

I need to at least talk to her again, see if there's something more to be had. She gave me her contact info, but I was so hung-over I forgot it (I know, I'm an asshole).

Every single night- I mean EVERY SINGLE NIGHT- they go out and then roll back in between 2-3 a.m.. This is totally fine by me. However, they are the loudest human beings I've ever encountered. Screaming and yelling, slamming the door, multiple people in and out of the room/hall for at least an hour. Every night. They have been reported for noise multiple times to no avail and several people, including myself, have asked them to tone it back. My question is- at this point what is there to do? They are violating the quiet hours policy and have been reported multiple times but it doesn't seem like there is an actual repercussion for this. Help? <eos> \n",

Before jumping into it, here is what is going on: I wrote and am going to direct a short film called Dream of Me, a 30-minute story about two best friends that are separated when the girl mysteriously finds herself in an alternate reality. The guy joins her a year later, and they realize their relationship could have changed in an instant. This story doesn't focus too much on the fact that there is a huge supernatural event that occurs, but more so on the relationship of the two characters.  I've been talking to a particular office at IU about receiving funds so I can pay the professional personnel on set. I am not sure how much I would receive from them, so I decided to reach out here for any ideas about how to make my GoFundMe page for this project more noticeable. Now, that does not necessarily mean I want you guys to donate, although that would be much appreciated, but I would like to know if there are certain things I should do with this. Alternatively, does anyone know who I could go to on campus to maybe help receive more funds?  Let me know of any thoughts or ideas! And please ask me questions if you have any. I have a terrible habit of not explaining myself very well. <eos> \n",

It is doable, but will be a heavy class load. I'm going to start taking specialization classes next semester, and will hopefully wrap up by May 2014.  My question is this: What is the easiest specialization, or the one that could be completed in a short amount of time the easiest? Honestly, I've gone through 3 advisors so far, and they're all garbage. I know they're trying their best, but my last advisor flat out told me \"I don't see many CS majors\" and \"I'm not really familiar with CS classes\" in our last meeting. AI seems to have the least amount of classes, credit-hrs wise, but also seems extremely hard. Thanks in advance for any advice. <eos> \n",

Perhaps not, but you have to admit, dressing in armor and battling with swords is [pretty badass]([url link]  Once upon a time, IU had a thriving [kendo club]([url link] but some time after I was no longer a graduate student, the club went inactive. Now, there is an entire cage room full of armor and swords and such, over between the gyms in HPER, waiting for someone to love them and use them, again.   I'm looking for students who are interested in getting the club up and running, again. I can serve as the faculty/staff adviser, and non-students can join, but students must serve as the officers and such.   Let me know if you're interested - it would take a little bit of work, but the payoff would be pretty fantastic. Edit: [Here's a picture of me]([url link] from a demo, back in the day.

My undergraduate degree is in SPEA with my honors thesis being about German economics. I figured I would look into doing the dual MPA-MA program in European Studies.  It looks really interesting and doable for me! However, I'm having a heck of a time finding admissions information for the MA program! What's the average GPA/GRE? What are good softs for the program? If anyone can provide/help find this information, it'd be greatly appreciated! Thanks, -- <eos> \n",

My first question is do you have to be in a fraternity to have fun at IU? The second question I have is how awesome are the basketball games? I'm a huge basketball fan but the atmosphere would be pretty difficult to match up against one of the other two schools I got into. Thanks for your time, go Hoosiers! EDIT: Third question- What is the suggested dorm? I've heard Briscoe, McNutt, and Teter are all good, but what do you guys think? <eos> \n",

I know it's the last home game for the football team, but the undergrads will all be on Thanksgiving Break right?

            "<bos> Has anyone had experience with this situation? My apartment complex allows dogs in downstairs units, but only smaller dogs. I live in an upstairs unit, so apparently I'm not allowed to have a dog at all. Has anyone had any experience circumventing a property's rules? Or just convincing your landlord to hear your case? Keep in mind that this neighborhood has hundreds of units, and it probably ran by a big holding company. <eos> \n",

Why don't you call up your mothers and say, \"Hey mom, I tried waking up 4,000 college kids last night and got the police called on me!\"  I mean seriously, it would've been fine tonight or tomorrow night. But on a school night? Fucking, prick thing to do.

I'm gonna be moving out to Bloomington in a few months for grad school (master's in public health), and I was hoping you all may be able to give me some information on the town and school from the perspectives of students who are (or were) living there. So, some general questions: 1.) What are the best places to live for someone who is looking for a calm and professional environment? I don't want an old-folks home, but I'm done with the whole university party/frat scene. 2.) What's the bus situation like there? Is it free public transit for IU students? Do you pay for it with cash/some kind of card? Is the bus even worth it? 3.) Best places to eat or hang downtown? Best places to go outside and adventure? I'm used to Appalachia; I'm going to guess there's not a whole lot in the way of mountains and hiking, near Bloomington. 4.) What the hell is a Hoosier...? Can someone explain that to me, and any other colloquialisms y'all have out there that I should know? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm most definitely going to fail one of my classess which will deal a pretty big blow to my overall GPA... I've emailed AskIU and have not recieved a response in ~2 weeks; at this point I am getting very anxious What do I do? Should I call the office of admissions? <eos> \n",

Before the interwebs was a common thing, these guys took it to the streets and filmed their lives for our satisfaction. It was the first show on the internet, and possibly the inspiration for Wayne's World. I would put them up myself but between work, class and the 300 DVDs I've burnt for this shin dig, I really don't have the time. tldr; Party at The Comedy Attic on July 3rd at 8pm, could you (pretty please) put some flyers up on campus? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I tried looking this up on IU's site but I think they only talk about firearms. Obviously guns and knives are out of the equation. But what kinds of other concealable weapons can I carry on me without getting in trouble with the law? Things such as pepper spray, tactical pens, extendable batons, police flashlights? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am considering the Kelley Direct Online MBA program. The online format is not the most appealing to me, but it is convenient for someone working out-of-state. Can anyone share insight in the program? I think a lot of intangible skills are gained by going to class on campus and interacting with peers. Is the online format designed in such a way to make up for this? Are the academics comparable to those on campus? Does anyone have thoughts on pursuing a dual MS Finance/MBA. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was giving some major thought into transferring into a different college this next semester and wanted to get advice from as many people as I possibly could. To give y'all some background, I am currently a freshman at Indiana University as a direct admit into the Kelley School of Business. I came into IU not knowing a soul. I came from out of state (from the south) and no one from my high school went here either. However, in the semester and a half that I have been here, I have failed to make a single friend. I think there are a couple reasons for this, but there are three main ones. Firstly, I chose to live on the honors floor, and quite frankly, about 3/5 of the people on my floor have a hard time interacting socially, and it's been hard connecting with the other 2/5 because everyone's doors are always closed and everyone is studying the majority of the time. With that in mind, I am still a pretty introverted person and find it hard to start conversations randomly, and I feel like if I can't find friends in a school with 40,000 people, the problem is probably with me. To try and combat this, I've joined three different clubs to try and meet new people, but nothing has seemed to work. At this point, about 8 months into college, I am pretty tired of having no friends and no one to talk to. My day consists of eating, working at my job, doing lots of busy work homework, attempting and failing to make friends, and sleeping. I am honestly tired of this routine and am seriously considering transferring to a different school. The only reason that I am hesitant to transfer is that the prestige of the degree and the opportunities I would get from IU is probably greater than any other degree I could get if I transferred. Getting the degree from IU would most likely set me up for my future career better than any other degree, but it is hard to justify going through 4 years of unhappiness, loneliness, and not enjoying my college experience in the slightest in order to get that, especially when I have a lot of options as to possible colleges I could go to (4.3 HS, 3.9 College GPA). I was hoping to get some advice on if you guys have gone through something similar and what did you do to make a \"breakthrough\" to find friends here/ any tips on doing so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated or just any advice in general. Thanks so much! <eos> \n",

Only problem is that I'm not real good at doing things alone. Also, I'm a transfer student starting this year and come from a much smaller school. So I don't know a whole lot about how any of this stuff works, or where anything is. I was wondering if anyone would basically be my workout partner? Help a new student out? I have mostly afternoon classes, so before, after or in-between those would be fine for me. <eos> \n",

I started today and need to find the most cost effective way to park close to campus and get to classes. Anywhere near a bus stop or within a reasonable walking distance from Wells Library would get the job done. My question is, do places like this exist without purchasing a parking pass, or how do you other IU commuters do it? <eos> \n",

I've always loved computers and it sounds like a promising career. If i switch now I can graduate on time or maybe a semester later.  For those that are in SoIC, what has been your experience? Were you able to get a job after college? Did you find that you needed your masters? What are the classes like? Any information from real people (have read everything on the web already) would help!

I have been doing all this driving in a fairly large truck that has been empty and I was recently thinking that it's kinda been a waste of gas and space. If anyone is on the way and has some things they need moved, I would be more than happy to help you move it, if you could help with money for gas that would be preferable, however if you can't I understand.

My sibling and our parents visited Campus View just once before deciding this was our best option to live at next year, so I was wondering if anybody can give me any insight on what to expect for next year.

I don't care about the size (smaller the better, in fact) but the rent needs to be around $400 a month. I'm looking for something basic that's within walking/biking distance of campus. Wherever that happens to be I don't really care, though being closer to downtown would be a plus. Does anyone have any leads for me? About myself: I'm currently a junior studying computer science. I'm quiet and mostly keep to myself, but I am also friendly. I'm very willing to do my share of chores. I don't smoke, I only drink socially, and I won't be having many parties.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I got this idea while speaking with an international student. His family is 1st generation rich and I was asking him how they were able to make that happen. He began telling me about how his parents had a group of friends who came from mixed backgrounds and created a very close nit group. That group pooled resources (physical and intellectual) in order to help each other succeed. Essentially if one of them was looking for investors or partners or workers for a business venture, he first went to the group to see if anyone could help. They helped each other out by investing in each other's businesses, helping connect each other with important people in the field, etc. As a result everyone in the group is very successful. I am unsure about their concept in our situation, but I find it interesting how different people define success differently and have such different goals in life. I think many of us run into the issue of how to actually be financially successful if our families aren't. Many of us have never had someone take us under their wing and explain how to make it in the world. Many of us are limited in our thinking and we dream small. Many of us feel lost and hopeless about our financial futures.  I think that a good first step would be for a small group of us to get together on a bi-weekly or monthly basis and simply talk about it. Think of it like a round table discussion. We will have it set up where each person gets to submit their ideas and issues, and the rest of us will weigh in on what we think that best option is any why.  I would prefer to host the first meeting or two in public, once I feel that I can trust the group members, I am willing to host the meetings in my home. I called the registrar about reserving a room on campus for these meetings, but was told that we must be either an official IU club and fill out a form, or we would need to get someone from a department to sign for the room. If we have too many people to fit in my home we can just meet somewhere, find an empty room that accommodates us, and take it. We will just be ready to move at any time if someone else comes in and needs it. We can meet in the arboretum or some other outdoors place on campus as well for the time being until it's too cold. Comment or pm if you're interested. <eos> \n",

Sorry of this is the wrong place to post this, just a worried student with no where else to turn! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Here's the con. It's short. I register for classes and apply for financial aid with IU. They send me a hefty bill with a specific due date. The financial aid office will not disburse any aid until after this due date. Furthermore, I'll have no idea what the aid is worth until after the same due date. If I don't pay on time, they charge a hefty late fee. I can't pay before the due date. That's why I need financial aid.  My question is this: When do you remember buying something whose price was indeterminate until seeing the receipt? This isn't a perfect analogy, but it sure feels pretty close. I don't know how this is ethical. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, I was at the University of Illinois as a freshman for electrical engineering, but unfortunately was dropped in my second semester. Since then, I've been taking courses at Parkland College, a school nearby. I've been taking classes that are applicable to an accounting or finance major, and have been actively involved in my work experiences, extracurricular activities, and have a GPA around a 3.3 now. I was wondering, how competitive is it to transfer into the business school now? My ACT score was a 33 and my SAT was a 2030, if that matters. Any help is appreciated! <eos> \n",

There were tons of people surrounding him, some clearly on the phone with 911, so I kept moving because there was nothing I could do to help. Does anyone know what happened? It looked like it may have been a scooter accident. I really hope the guy is okay. <eos> \n"

I don't feel like attending that long of an orientation, most other schools have orientations a day long especially for transfer students.

I am a student who lives in the University Residence Halls. Today my cousin came to visit unannounced, and I told him he would be alright to park in a D spot for only a few minutes so he could check out my place. When we got back he had a $50 ticket for not having a permit. I felt bad and told him I would pay it since I told him he could park there.  I am just wondering what would happen if I don't pay the ticket. Since he had no permit, there is no way to track it to me, so I could not get billed. They got his license plate number and car description though. If it does not get paid, will they look him up based on this or just let it go assuming he doesn't get another ticket here? I got one last year for parking over the line in my spot, but was able to appeal it, but this one I don't think could be appealed since the car was blatantly parked without a permit, and it was clearly posted. Any advice is appreciated. I won't be heartbroken if I end up having to pay it, but I just am wondering what would happen if I do not. <eos> \", \"<bos> As you may know, there's a pretty big football game this weekend. Actually, it's probably the biggest IUFB game in the last 20 years. If IU can knock off Wisconsin on Saturday, they'll have the inside track for a berth in the B1G title game. If they can win that, Rose Bowl! I shouldn't need to tell anyone how historic that'd be. Whether you like football or not, this team has worked their asses off all year to represent IU and now it's our last chance this year to show them some love. These guys deserve a packed house, especially for the seniors.  So tell all your friends, wake up early, hit the bars, hit the tailgate, get rowdy and be in the game by noon to rock The Rock!

I'm a senior at IU Bloomington this semester, I've been at IUB my whole college career. My question is how do I sign up for an online spanish course that is offered out of IU East? I tried emailing my adviser but seeing as it's officially winter break, I don't think she's going to get back with me in time. The reason I'm interested in the online class is because I didn't pass HispS200 this semester and have to retake it, however, I already have my set schedule for next semester and I need to take it online. I did some research and found that IU East has Span-S200 (which is the equivalent) 100% online, but it won't let me register for it (I'm assuming because I'm enrolled at IUB). Please help, I need to take this class and I need to take it online and it has to be next semester or I won't graduate on time.

I've been doing a ridiculous amount of scholarship work, but those have mostly fallen through.

Toxic environments are not. What are some good women’s sports on campus that will be welcome to beginners and have friendly communities? Is it a sort of thing that you have to take as a gym class?

I'm hoping for a little Big10 support: I'm attending a grad party this weekend, and I need a gift. The graduate is a girl who will be starting at IU in the fall.

For some background information, my family and I are US Citizens, living in a foreign country. After applying to colleges and reviewing my options, I have committed to IU-Bloomington. As of now, I am an out of state resident, as my parents currently have no state residency. They are planning on moving with me to Bloomington, if not immediately, than at most in a few months. My question is, how soon after they move to Indiana can I claim in state tuition? Can it be right in the second semester? Or will it only be in the next year? If in the second semester, how do I go about claiming residency? Again, my parents don't have a state residency currently, so I am assuming that the process of actually gaining residency in Indiana should be fast.  Additionally, my family wants to move back to US, to settle there for at least ten to twenty years. If they get an apartment, and my parents get a job, do you think that after a year, after taxes are paid, we would be able to prove residency? <eos> \", \"<bos> Hi all, I'll be starting as a PhD student at IU in the fall.

May as well just have one place where they can compare dorms. I'll start. I lived in Foster last year and it was pretty good. I'll say it's probably the worst of the northwest neighborhood, but it has some perks. One pro is having Gresham cafeteria, Hoo Den, and the Crimson Creamery right outside your door. It's also very close to the SRSC (gym) and a short walk from Assembly Hall. There are definitely some cons though... laundry isn't as convenient as it is in some dorms, the bathrooms are community so they're generally trashed (at least on guys' floors), and it's probably gonna be loud most nights. <eos> \", \"<bos> Hey Bloomingtonites, Being someone that doesn't attend bars too often, I'm not well versed on the best drink specials.

For event details, registration, and other information, please visit: [url link] We’re happy to announce that Tourney voting is back. All early registrants can nominate up to 3 games they want to have be sponsored tourneys. There will be 4 official, prize supported tournaments, voted on by early registrants. Prize pools are generally about $100-$125. That aside, there are dozens of other games being played all the event, both in tournament fashion, and in casual play. The raffle prizes generally exceed $10k in value, and easily make the event more \"worthwhile\" than the tournament prizes do.  <eos> ', \"<bos> I made the mistake of slacking off a bit in high school and ended up getting just below the requirements for being a direct admit (3.68 GPA 1200 SAT) because I didn't know about direct admission at the time. It sounds like getting into Kelley and getting signed up for the classes you need is just so difficult and I just get the feeling that I might end up hating everything and not enjoying my experience at all.

The shuttle took off from the Union so we were wandering around inside for a while. I decided to take a look at the campus architectural model by the elevators for the hotel (you should all know what the hell I'm talking about) and discovered something kind of ridiculous. Turns out IU has plans to extend Law Ln (north side of train tracks) to the part of 10th street that just crosses from the south side to the north side of the tracks. If you know the area I'm talking about, then you should know that this sounds like a really stupid idea. To come out at Law Ln onto 10th street would mean that you're trying to merge with a complete blind spot to your right. The best thing you could do is add a stop light which would increase congestion on 10th street to ludicrous proportions. The second piece of future construction I noticed was pushing Woodlawn further north, through the train tracks, and meeting at the bypass. This I don't have as big of an issue with except for the fact that to do this, they'd effectively be splitting Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium. I don't know about you guys, but I feel like there's just something incredibly wrong with that. Downvote if you wish, but I thought this is something all of us need to know, and maybe even discuss about bringing to the administration. tl;dr: More road construction meaning more congestion, and the splitting of two of our most iconic teams (maybe one of those teams is iconic for the wrong reason, but whatever it's still the idea). <eos> \", '<bos> Are lines usually long?

My apartment complex allows dogs in downstairs units, but only smaller dogs. I live in an upstairs unit, so apparently I'm not allowed to have a dog at all.

I'm gonna be moving out to Bloomington in a few months for grad school (master's in public health), and I was hoping you all may be able to give me some information on the town and school from the perspectives of students who are (or were) living there. So, some general questions: 1.) What are the best places to live for someone who is looking for a calm and professional environment? I don't want an old-folks home, but I'm done with the whole university party/frat scene. 2.) What's the bus situation like there? Is it free public transit for IU students? Do you pay for it with cash/some kind of card? Is the bus even worth it? 3.) Best places to eat or hang downtown? Best places to go outside and adventure? I'm used to Appalachia; I'm going to guess there's not a whole lot in the way of mountains and hiking, near Bloomington. 4.) What the hell is a Hoosier...?

The online format is not the most appealing to me, but it is convenient for someone working out-of-state. Can anyone share insight in the program? I think a lot of intangible skills are gained by going to class on campus and interacting with peers. Is the online format designed in such a way to make up for this? Are the academics comparable to those on campus? Does anyone have thoughts on pursuing a dual MS Finance/MBA. <eos> ', '<bos> Do you get penalized for just watching porn on the IU secure wifi?

To give y\\'all some background, I am currently a freshman at Indiana University as a direct admit into the Kelley School of Business. I came into IU not knowing a soul. I came from out of state (from the south) and no one from my high school went here either. However, in the semester and a half that I have been here, I have failed to make a single friend. I think there are a couple reasons for this, but there are three main ones. Firstly, I chose to live on the honors floor, and quite frankly, about 3/5 of the people on my floor have a hard time interacting socially, and it\\'s been hard connecting with the other 2/5 because everyone\\'s doors are always closed and everyone is studying the majority of the time. With that in mind, I am still a pretty introverted person and find it hard to start conversations randomly, and I feel like if I can\\'t find friends in a school with 40,000 people, the problem is probably with me. To try and combat this, I\\'ve joined three different clubs to try and meet new people, but nothing has seemed to work. At this point, about 8 months into college, I am pretty tired of having no friends and no one to talk to. My day consists of eating, working at my job, doing lots of busy work homework, attempting and failing to make friends, and sleeping. I am honestly tired of this routine and am seriously considering transferring to a different school. The only reason that I am hesitant to transfer is that the prestige of the degree and the opportunities I would get from IU is probably greater than any other degree I could get if I transferred. Getting the degree from IU would most likely set me up for my future career better than any other degree, but it is hard to justify going through 4 years of unhappiness, loneliness, and not enjoying my college experience in the slightest in order to get that, especially when I have a lot of options as to possible colleges I could go to (4.3 HS, 3.9 College GPA). I was hoping to get some advice on if you guys have gone through something similar and what did you do to make a \"breakthrough\" to find friends here/ any tips on doing so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated or just any advice in general.

His family is 1st generation rich and I was asking him how they were able to make that happen. He began telling me about how his parents had a group of friends who came from mixed backgrounds and created a very close nit group. That group pooled resources (physical and intellectual) in order to help each other succeed. Essentially if one of them was looking for investors or partners or workers for a business venture, he first went to the group to see if anyone could help. They helped each other out by investing in each other's businesses, helping connect each other with important people in the field, etc. As a result everyone in the group is very successful. I am unsure about their concept in our situation, but I find it interesting how different people define success differently and have such different goals in life. I think many of us run into the issue of how to actually be financially successful if our families aren't. Many of us have never had someone take us under their wing and explain how to make it in the world. Many of us are limited in our thinking and we dream small. Many of us feel lost and hopeless about our financial futures.  I think that a good first step would be for a small group of us to get together on a bi-weekly or monthly basis and simply talk about it. Think of it like a round table discussion. We will have it set up where each person gets to submit their ideas and issues, and the rest of us will weigh in on what we think that best option is any why.  I would prefer to host the first meeting or two in public, once I feel that I can trust the group members, I am willing to host the meetings in my home. I called the registrar about reserving a room on campus for these meetings, but was told that we must be either an official IU club and fill out a form, or we would need to get someone from a department to sign for the room. If we have too many people to fit in my home we can just meet somewhere, find an empty room that accommodates us, and take it. We will just be ready to move at any time if someone else comes in and needs it. We can meet in the arboretum or some other outdoors place on campus as well for the time being until it's too cold.

They send me a hefty bill with a specific due date. The financial aid office will not disburse any aid until after this due date. Furthermore, I'll have no idea what the aid is worth until after the same due date. If I don't pay on time, they charge a hefty late fee. I can't pay before the due date. That's why I need financial aid.  My question is this: When do you remember buying something whose price was indeterminate until seeing the receipt?
