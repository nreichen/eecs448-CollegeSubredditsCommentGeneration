Looking for suggestions for places that are good for: * Hiking (within 2-3 hours drive): * Camping (within 2-3 hours drive): * BBQ ( place with bbq pits within 1 hour drive): * Parks-boating-swimming activities (place within 1-2 hours drive): * Other summer outdoor activity places within 2 hours drive: Hoping to leave early morning and get back in evening unless camping there.

I have an online class but that's it so I have a lot of free time. I already applied for relevant jobs on the virtual job board but now I'm looking for any place that's hiring. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Just wanted to remind everyone that the voter registration deadline is coming up on October 9. If you aren't registered yet you can fill out an application at the Champaign County Clerk's office at 1776 E. Washington St. in Urbana. There will also probably be some opportunities to register on campus if you can't make it over there. Also wanted to let everyone know that with the Post-2010 Census re-districting C-U is now in the 13th IL Congressional District, NOT the 15th. There is a convenient map of the redrawn districts available here: [url link] Even though Obama will win Illinois your vote is still immensely important in the Congressional and Local Elections. The Democratic Congressional candidate is Dr. David Gill and the Republican is Rodney Davis. Regardless of your party affiliation remember that there is not much a President can do if his party doesn't have a majority in Congress.The names of the local candidates and directions to the County Clerk's office can be found here: [url link] <eos> \n",

I'm interested in these as tech electives (I'm in ece) and I was wondering how difficult or time-consuming they are? Also does Math 348 satisfy our Advanced Comp requirements?

She's the only reason I like going to the cbtf and softens the blow that 225 does to my psyche. Anyways, how creepy or weird would be to ask her out?  How do I even ask a stranger out? Better yet, how can I get her to say yes? Bless  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Dumb question but I have to ask because I met some people at Panda Express tonight talking about digital currencies. They seemed kinda hyped but almost in a cultish multi-level marketing way.  So I pose the question to any CS gurus, Econ majors, or other reasonable people: Is digital currency just a scam? Like Bitcoin and others? My inner self sais it's just next level trolling and scamming. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I'm an incoming transfer student to math + cs (hoping to come in as a junior), and I really want to take CS 374 asap because I know it is a very important class for interviews/internships. I have CS 225 credit, but my college did not require CS students to take linear algebra so I will not have that credit coming in. Is it really important to know linear alg for algorithms? Or would I be able to do well in the class without it? The multivariable calculus at my college spent the last like 3 weeks on matrices and homogenous systems (the linear algebra part of diffeq, it was a weird ending to multi). Also, I have a bit of a weird circumstance as I will come in with CS 225 credit, but I will not have CS 125 credit. Does anybody know if I will be allowed to take classes that have a CS 225 prerequisite since I have the credit for it?  Thank you for any advice you can give! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> which is great. I haven't had any problems, well expect for running out of hot water mid-shower. I moved into my current apt in mid-Jan. My next door neighbors have a kid roughly about 5-7 years old. I don't mind the kid, usually quiet except he cries about once a week. After all its normal for kids to cry so I never thought anything of it. Well today, I heard him cry out,\"Stop daddy, Stop\" over an over followed by sobbing. I couldn't understand the parent(s) at all but I could hear them speaking. (I was trying to read, so it was quite in my apt.) Now I am worried. What should I do? Who should I contact?  I may be overreacting but the kids cries haunt me as I am sitting here.  Edit: I'm not calling CPS. If I hear such commotion again, I'm just going to call and complain about the noise. That way someone will have to come check it out at least. Now goodnight, we have class in a few hours.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've been biking since the beginning of the school year and thankfully I've avoided any accidents. However, I've had some close calls. What's the cause of most of these could be collisions? Pedestrians who are completely unaware of their surroundings. Please please please if you're gonna put in headphones don't also stare down at your phone while walking. You're effectively Helen Keller when you do that and it's dangerous for you and those around you. So many times people will assume that bikers know your intentions when crossing lanes or crossways. This is not true. We react to what you do. All I want is for people to stay a LITTLE more aware of their surroundings so less accidents happen. Thanks for hearing me out.       <eos> \n",

It was reported Sept. 16 that Zhang had sexually assaulted another person with whom he was acquainted on multiple occasions dating back to March 2015. It additionally was reported that he used the other person’s debit card without permission and repeatedly tortured a dog. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Quick rant. For those of you who don't know, the 2nd floor men's bathroom in Grainger has 2 paper towel dispensers, and 1 of them has a handle that is messed up. The plastic mold that fits around the handle has fallen off, so pushing it is really annoying and hurts after like 3 pushes since your bare fingers are pushing against a thin metal rod. The dispenser next to the sinks is usually used first since it works properly, so the other one is usually the only one that has towels about 75% of the time. I know this might sound petty, but how fucking hard is it for the people that work there to fix the fucking towel dispenser!!!??? It would take probably only a few minutes, and this has been broken basically the entire fucking year!!! Are the workers really that clueless that they can't fix a simple problem with a paper towel dispenser that is used by hundreds of people each day??!!! I pay around 32 fucking grand to go to this school as an in-state student, and this is what I fucking get? Like I said, this might sound extremely petty, but it just doesn't seem like it would be that hard to fix, so I get a bit frustrated that something this obvious has been ignored for so long. There also are a few other things that piss me off about the Grainger bathrooms, but I don't think I need to elaborate here about that. Anyway, that's it, and I hope you all have a great day! Don't forget to set your clocks ahead 1 hour!!! EDIT: I understand that posting this won't accomplish anything, but I just needed to let this steam out. Also, I don't say anything because I don't want to come off like a needy asshole. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am a sophomore and only just learned about this last week!! If you go to the Ike and give them your id at the front desk and ask for a practice room, they'll give you a key and you can go to a quiet hallway with three piano rooms with really well-tuned Yamaha standups!!! And there are windows in there too so you don't feel totally isolated :). Last year I suffered through Bromley's garbage piano without knowing about this. I thought I'd just tell everyone!!!! I don't know if everyone knows this or not but it's made my life easier here, and I bet it will make other piano players happy too!!!

All willing participants are challenged to complete a film in 49 hours(due to DST ending). These films will be screened a few days later and 3 judges will decide whose was the best and the winning team gets prizes. You don't need to have submitted a film to watch the screenings. If you decide to film, you will be sent prompts that need to be in the film(thus preventing people from shooting like today). It can be any theme(action/comedy/documentary) but please be smart about content(nothing past a harsh R rating).  <eos> \n",

I will be an incoming freshman this fall, and I have a Snake, I am clueless as to what I can do with it. I don't know if any dorms allow it, or if I'll just have to leave it at home until I can move off campus. But I digress, my question is what is the policy for small pets at UIUC? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I applied for Cod Pathways for fall 2018 and was accepted but didn’t enroll in the program. Instead I chose to go to UIC. Now I feel that I have made the wrong choice and would like to transfer to UIUC. Would it be better to transfer over to Cod now or next semester or to hold it out for the year and apply to transfer next year. I am planning on cs plus x at uiuc and currently I am doing cs at uic. Would it also be possible to just take the courses pathways would’ve had me enroll in and then talk to advisors and let them know I was accepted into pathways but did not officially enroll but still took the required classes. I know pathways is for Coe and cs plus x is for las but wouldn’t it be easier transferring if you’re in the pathways program? Thanks. <eos> \n",

I know McKinley is closed at this time of night, but I do have a fridge magnet from McKinley that says \"Dial a nurse any time, any day- 333-2700\" so I've called that number 3 times and been disconnected 3 times. The pain really does make it nearly impossible to function, so is there any emergency health number I can call that will actually work? <eos> \n",

I really enjoy outdoor activites such as hiking, biking, and running. I also like to play basketball quite often. These activities I'm not so worried about. I'm more worried about nightlife and food. I'm a huge foodie and where I'm from there is an amazing selection of international foods everywhere you look. How is the food in Champaign? Also, where I'm from, there is always something to do, whether it be a comedy show, fun bars/clubs, music shows (preference is electronic and hip-hop). How is the nightlife in Champaign?  Also, it would be cool to hear from a grad student who also left a huge city to go to UIUC. If you could let me know what you think of the town and what some fun things I could pick up while I'm there, I'd appreciate it.  <eos> \n",

My band and I are looking for a male singer who, as the title says, has familiarity with anything from the classic rockers (Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Foreigner, Queen, Van Halen etc.) to the funk masters (Parliament, James Brown, Chic, ), to Paul Revere and the Raiders, or anything in between.  **What styles do we play?** Jazz, hard rock (not metal), blues, funk, acoustic-indie, slow piano stuff - okay, pretty much a lot of different styles and feelings.  **What are our aspirations?** Currently, we have enough original song projects in the works to produce at least one album's worth of music. On top of that, playing out and live is definitely a goal for the near-future. A tight relationship will be had. **What about us?** Together (a drummer, a bassist, a guitarist) we have over 25 years of playing experience. We will be continually dabbling in songwriting and originality, so any added creativity will be warmly welcomed - even if it's as minor as critiquing a riff, or rewording a random lyric.  ...most importantly: we like to have fun! **Are you interested?** If this post has piqued your musical curiosity, feel free to leave a comment or simply directly message us (on this account, of course.)  **Note: If interested, we can supply recordings of our sounds, and we would also greatly like to hear what you can do!** Take care, guys! <eos> \n",

I have an older sibling who did CS here; judging from what i've seen him do, i feel inclined to take CS just because it is easier to me than concepts in ECE. But i've also heard that more often than not, ECE has more humble/sociable people which is also important to me. So any other points for or against either of these would be great thanks  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a junior in CS and this class is kicking my ass. I'm not getting good scores on the MP's or labs and am overall just really stressed out with it, and I'm sure many other students in this class are in the same boat. However, I don't think this is entirely on me (us?).  So far this semester, the MP's and some labs are new and they are incredibly poorly spec'd out. Not to mention that 50% of the time TA's actually show up to their office hours. Actually, 2 of the assignments already have had significant deadline extensions because a) the assignment is harder than they thought it would be and b) there are too many quirks they didn't think of, and have to update us on as the week progresses. It's almost better to wait until the last day to work on the MP's and labs to wait for course staff to fix all of the bugs/clarify edge cases so you don't have to fix your entire code to account for the changes they make as the week goes on. For one of the assignments, they couldn't even get the auto-grader to work. I spent hours trying to figure out why I'm failing the autograder, only to get an email saying that we will get the points for it anyway, their mistake. What a joke. You would think that a top 5 cs school can at least release bug-free and clear assignments, or at the very least, be able to grade them. This pisses me off. My suggestions: - Please be more careful when selecting your course/teaching assistants. It should be more than \"if they got an A in the class we will let them TA\". CS 225 2014 Fall is what you should strive for in terms of TA quality. That was an impressive group of TAs. - Release bug-free and CLEARLY spec'd out assignments. It shouldn't be the case that there are 20 piazza posts asking for clarification on your MP, and even the TAs/CAs can't agree/will argue with each other on how you should handle it. - And finally, I'm sure you realize this now, but the first lab and the second MP were a joke. A 4 day extension on a lab? 10's of erratas on an MP? Can't even grade the MP? I understand that you're trying new things, but holy shit. To my understanding, systems has been horrible for a while. At a top 5 cs school this shouldn't be the case. <eos> \n",

I've taken classes for them, but they weren't AP or at a college. I'd like to get them out of the way if possible. * 2) I've read online that UIUC awards RHET 105 credit to incoming freshman with a high enough SAT/ACT score. Does this still apply for the 2018-2019 year, or will I have to take the AP Lang test? Would like to save time, haha. <eos> \n",

You save money by not going out. 3. You have more time to study and get good grades. 4. If you major in CS, you won't feel out of place. 5. You have more time for your hobbies. 6. You can pretend to be a badass loner character off some zombie apocalypse tv show. 7. You have more time for introspection. 8. You can meme it up on reddit and then cry because you realize all your flaws and faults with no one to distract you from them and succumb to a further debilitating depression with no way out.

Can anyone explain it to me???  Thanks  <eos> \n",

My advisor told me to take it at my community college to score better. Does anybody have experience taking calc 1 or 2 at COD? If so was it online? There is a good chance I would need to take night/online/weekend classes since I will be working over the summer.  Thanks <eos> \n",

I'll be getting to UIUC in Jan 10th, and staying at a hotel until the 15th, however I'm not sure if It would be better for me to ship to my hotel or to the dorm I'll be staying at (Hopkins Hall).  Would I be able to pickup my Mac before check in, or only on the 15th? Or should I just ship it to my hotel? Thank you! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi guys, After using the search bar and the sidebar links I could not find enough information on what Ikenberry dorms/area I should put on my housing application. I guess I should elaborate: For the past few weeks, I and my friend have been looking at various housing options at U of I. After much thought, we finally narrowed our first picks to the Ikenberry area. Although we have been accepted into the engineering program (Civil for me, Computer for him), we don’t mind the distance that may come in living in the area and actually believe that living in the six-pack will be much more beneficial than let’s say ISR or PAR. The problem right now is that we don’t know which area, North or South, is more beneficial to choose. What we are aiming for right now is a chance to live in one of the more recent dorms (Nugent or Bousfield) since they offer improved amenities when compared to the other dorms. However, we know that upperclassmen have priority over us and there will be some fierce competition to get in so one of our major questions is really which area will offer the greater chance of getting into these newer dorms? Aside from this, we would like to know which area is generally “better” just in case that we don’t get into the newer dorms. The reason I bring this up is that I noticed that Taft-Van Doren is sort of separate from the main block and the idea that we would “isolated” (a bit of an exaggeration I know) from the main scene is making me hesitant to consider Ikenberry South which my friend is telling me to select since he believes we have a shot for Bousfield. I appreciate you guys reading through my blathering and thank you for your responses! Sincerely, xProlesx *Edit* Sorry guys for the formatting, I don't know how format on reddit. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have a close family member who is in a place where he needs some kind of medication (to deal with intense, hours-long, nightly, panic attacks) but is unwilling to take SSRI's because of bad experiences in the past. He clearly has a panic disorder at a minimum (way above generalized anxiety), but I'm not 100% sure if he'd meet the full diagnosis of PTSD (he has most definitely experienced some major life-traumas, I'm just not sure that he fits perfectly in that box). He has a local primary care physician that he's seeing next week, but I'm worried if this doctor is unwilling or resistant to the idea of medicinal marijuana, what we can do next. Just to be clear, this is a guy who does not currently use marijuana in any way and is not looking for some kind of way to get legal MJ for recreational use. Honestly, I'm not sure medicinal would help, but I'm trying to consider all options. Counseling is already happening, but I think it's going to take more than therapy. I really can't engage in providing any more details since I'm not really comfortable doing that for him so constructive comments only please.   He's not an immediate risk to himself, but he is intensely miserable at the moment. Also, he recently graduated so he's not part of the campus healthcare system.  Feel free to send me PM's if you think it's appropriate.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

My petition needs 50 signatures in order for me to get on the ballot (We're not even to the voting stage yet) and I'm hoping to grab a few signatures here. Now, a bit about my qualifications: Since the last election cycle, I've been working on the Senate Committee for Conduct Governance which is another way of saying that I've been working with faculty and administration on the student code. My goals are to aim for a transparent, honest and functional student senate, one that actively listens to and routinely reaches out to the student body before major actions are taken. I plan on hosting a number of chats on the quad with students to figure out what they want to see in our Senate and what they want from University politics as an entity.

I don't think I am the only one on this sleep schedule, but does anyone else think it is unfair to have to wake up at 8am to take some test worth 40% of your grade; I have always done better on midday/night tests.  Edit: I want to add that I don't even have any 8am finals this year, I was just bringing up the point; also I generally wake up around 6:30 to 7 am during the summer; my sleep schedule only gets shifted in Champaign, generally my roommates are the reason my sleep schedule shifts; most people only have partial control over their sleep schedule (i.e. roommate walks in at 3am drunk and is obnoxious, or sets alarm at 5:30) <eos> \n",

Based on the website, they seem more equipped to deal with short-term or scholastic problems as opposed to long-term issues.

We give you the opportunity to dive in and participate! Whether it's weaving, dancing, feasting, or swordfighting - we put the needle, dance shoes, turkey leg, or sword in your hand and teach you how to go at it yourself! It's not a play, it's not scripted or choreographed - it's a chance to learn about medieval life by actually doing things the way they did them. We're a local RSO chapter of an international organization - the Society for Creative Anachronism. We'll be holding a public event on Saturday, January 21st, at the Union. The activities begin at 8:30 AM and admission is free to UIUC students ($15 for non-student adults). Anyone is welcome - from \"I could watch some swordfighting, I guess\" to \"I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG CENTURY, YOU ARE MY PEOPLE!\" And if you have any questions, I'm happy to help :)  <eos> \n",

Update: he have the ICES form at the final and was sitting right next to the folder you had to turn them into, and literally looked at mine as I turned it in and I could tell by his face he’d seen I’d rated him badly.

            "<bos> Hi all, freshman here I've noticed a lot of people biking around campus, and while it's not totally necessary, I figure it might be cool if i got one, seeing as it would cut my 25-30 walk to loomis down to probably just 10ish minutes by bike  My only real concern is I'm not really sure what I'll do with my bike once winter comes. I'm an overseas student, so sending it home isn't an option, and I figure if I just let it lie around while it snows, It'd probably start rusting (not sure about this, come from a non-snowing place) So yeah, what do you guys do with your bikes once it starts snowing? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently in Engineering, planning to graduate in Fall 2017. I have 20 credit hours remaining, and I'd like to allocate this as 9 this semester and 11 in Fall 2017. The difference is $3,000 vs if I do 12 and 8.  Unfortunately, I spoke to an advisor who said this is not allowed. The Dean apparently gets pissed if underloading to save money is brought up, and they threatened to put me on probation if I don't take 12 credits. My question is: does this matter? I don't plan on going to grad school; besides, shouldn't it be immediately obvious to anyone looking at my transcript that I'm not on probation for failing?  So what are the consequences of this? I feel like probation for this is worth $3,000; unless anyone has good reasons against? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> As the semester rapidly approaches, reddit is sure to be flooded with questions. We at the advising office believe that a cohesive question thread could help to alleviate that pressure.  I am obviously best suited to answer CS-related questions, but I am familiar with the policies of most departments, and I'm happy to assist with those inquiries as well.  I will try to answer as quickly as possible, but paperwork is naturally crazy right now. Students and instructors: feel free to help answer. I will confirm/correct any answers that are posted here.  Thanks, Steve <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I want to create a series of episodes to be placed on youtube, hulu, whatever. It would be like Dorm Life, except much funnier.  [url link] So basically, I'm wondering if any of you are interested in acting/writing/helping film and edit this next Fall. I want to promote it heavily, and if it's funny, people will start tuning in. I already have much of the pilot figured out and can tell people further in depth about it if interested. Characters: Douglas: Sexually advanced but mechanically impaired: he is a parapelegic with an attitude Claire  Mary: two christian sisters, one a secret atheist and the other a devout believer. they both go in opposite directions throughout the season. Melvin: straight from F7U12. We can use a lot of reddit jokes, considering how funny but unpopular it is to the mainstream audience.  Those are just a few characters! I'm still cooking stuff up! Post here if you're interested. I have absolutely 0 support from any of my other friends so if we are going to do this, it's going to be started from from this thread! :)  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey, guys. I'm quite oblivious about football culture in this country and I frankly have no idea what to expect during Homecoming Weekend. Like I seriously don't even know what tailgating is, and I've never been to a football game. Can someone give me a quick and honest run-down of what I should expect on campus during that time? Any advice about commuting on campus during the events would be helpful as well. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Just curious if anyone has taken 374 with Chekuri before this semester. He runs things quite a bit differently (no idk policy, no cheatsheets, etc) and I was wondering if anyone happened to remember the grade distribution the last time he taught it (or if it was significantly different from Erickson's.)  I looked for it on previous sites but it wasn't listed like it is on the sites of semesters where Erickson taught.  Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I did a search and it seemed like all the past steam tunnel posts were 1+ years old and had been archived. So I'll start a new one! I'm looking for some info on access points to the steam tunnels (yes I understand it's illegal and everything that comes with going down there). I was searching last night and couldn't find any that were open. I tried Davenport, Noyes(I couldn't actually get in the building), and the Chem Annex. Then I gave up. Does anyone know of an open one? Thanks!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I got accepted into UIUC for engineering physics through early admissions. But at that time, I was unaware of my passion for computer science (this is my first year taking a computer science course). Now I really want to do computer science in college. So should still go to UIUC and risk not being able to transfer into CS; since I have heard it is really difficult to get into, or go to another school such as UIC or IIT where I will be able to do CS for sure? I realize this may be biased towards UIUC, but I would like to hear what people have to say. Thanks <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm looking to get an eye exam soon, and I saw some posts on here of a few places but most of those posts were several years old. I saw that Kessler Optical and Illini Eyecare seem pretty good, but I don't know if they take student insurance, and if they do idk if I have to bring in an insurance card. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I was going to take a 3 hour class this summer and registered for it, applied for financial aid, and then got rejected since you need 6+ hours. (Doh). By the time I got rejected aid the online drop deadline had passed. By the time I got my withdrawal processed it was during the 70% refund period. So now I owe the university about ~900 dollars for NOT attending school nor using any facilities or services. The peculiar thing is that a friend of mine withdrew at the same time and got a full refund. We were both asked when we did it if \"we utilized University facilities or services\" and we both answered no.  So two questions: How come I got charged and my buddy didn't? And is there anything I can do to fight this? The dilemma is that I'm currently under financial hold and can't register for the remainder of my hours I need for fall semester. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> anyone know anything about the finance-related engineering courses in Industrial Engineering? mostly 400,500 levels, I think. I'm an ECE major interested in taking those courses. I don't have much background in finances. but I can do programming and statistics.  i have looked at the course names and descriptions, but I'm wondering what kind of things you get to do after taking those courses, how difficult they are, and if there's anything unusual to be aware of. any inputs? thanks!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am taking the Chinese placement test in August and need to do well to help move my schedule along. I want to dual major in EALC but with each Chinese level being 5 hours it takes up alot of each semester. First semester they offer 1 and 3 and second 2 and 4. I think id be lucky to get into 2. I want that, though, so i can start second semester because if they decide im not even eligible for two ill have to wait until next year...  So to anyone, how is the placement? Do they ever place students who have completed up to Chinese 5 into the beginners course? As a prospective major, what classes would I most likely be taking. Do you have any link to a syllabus or things I can study that would help me prepare? Thank you <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Failed my first semester  Just woke up at 5 in the afternoon and it's dark out, what a depressing way to start the day. Somewhere towards the end of the semester I lost motivation to care about grades and now I'm failing every course. I have no motivation to study for finals. The only reason I get out of bed is to sound confident when my parents text me and ask me how I'm doing. I don't know if I can break this to them. I was an AP scholar in highschool with high honors every year, and now I'm depressed? And if my parents found out that I've failed they would kill me. So I'll have to figure out a clever lie. Is it worth it to come back next semester and try again, or should I just give up on college and live in my parent's basement, alone and hating myself till the end? Thoughts?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm currently a freshman living in Bromley and I'm thinking about changing to public housing. The reason for doing so is because I don't like Bromley (facilities in general), I REALLY don't get along with my roommate, and the vibe in my room is just really off. I also don't party at all, so originally, I was going to just switch roommates, but my roommate doesn't party either and chances are, living in Bromley, I'm going to get a new roommate who parties. Anyways, I was just wondering if any of you guys have heard of people switching from private housing to public housing, or if anyone knows if this is at all possible? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I saw a lot of people talking about depression and anxiety at UIUC. I'm registering for DRES for next semester after being diagnosed with depression and GAD, and I'm curious about other people's experiences. Like what do they do? Does it really help? Also, do we have any support groups going on for people with anxiety and/or depression? Also, how do your professors and peers react to this stuff? I'm trying to apply for jobs/research but it's really awkward telling them my status and explaining why my GPA is in the shitters. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Basically, there is a good chance that I won't pass 374, and I'm sad about it. :/ Homework grade of 75% (avg 81, std dev 13.93), 35.5 on the first exam (avg 54, std dev 18.5), 24 on the second (avg 47.5, std dev 17.75)... And the multiple choice final is tomorrow morning.  I would have received a 34 on the second final but for a single error which I realized in hindsight - unfortunately, hindsight doesn't earn much exam credit. I'm studying my ass off for this exam, but part of me wonders if it will make any difference. Have my existing grades doomed me to retake the class?   Update: I passed with a D+!!! Got a mere 30% on the final but I'm ecstatic. Thanks to everyone for the motivation to finish strong. :)  <eos> \n",

I’ve never done any of the traditional vices, nor do I want to in the future. Will I still be able to fit in and find friends at one of the nation’s top party schools?  Secondly, I’m more interested in the humanities than the STEM that the school is known for. Is a humanities degree respected on and off campus? <eos> \n",

I've been scouring the RSO handbooks, student codes, etc., and it looks like we can register a brewing RSO, but funding (for brewing) would have to come out of our pockets. Even if the official RSO group gets shot down for some reason, would anyone be interested in some form of homebrewing club? If so, what would you want from such a club? I assume recipes, ideas, and of course brew-swapping would be a good start, but I would like to hear other ideas from anyone interested.  *EDIT: It appears one already exists!

Is there anywhere I can practice tomorrow and Thursday before the audition that I can gain access to being a non-music major? Do I need to notify anyone that I'm auditioning, or do I jest show up? Do these auditions have any dress code? Do I need to supply a copy of the etude I'm playing? Thanks for any help!! <eos> \n",

By the time I got there her face and hands were covered in blood but it turned out she was pretty much ok, just in pain and horribly shaken up but (as far as we know) no broken bones or anything. The guy who hit her did a pretty good job of taking care of the situation, they exchanged info and he brought her to wherever she was headed (or maybe to the hosptial). Anyway, this has had me pretty shaken up all day. Does anyone know this girl, and if so, is she doing better now? <eos> \n",

Last semester, my friends and I found out about a jazz class that allows people to watch students play, and it has been amazing. we are second semester seniors and are wondering if there are other little known cool experiences like that at UIUC. I really want to get as much of the school as I can before I leave.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Is this worth it? I've heard mixed things about previous iterations of the online course. Has it improved? How is it? But imagine how good a Masters would look on a resume! Does having \"Masters degree in CS\" on my resume not matter as much? should I focus on taking Coursera courses and learning the material and getting certificates? Is having a bunch of certificates just as good? One day left to submit the application apparently. $20,000 is a lot but not undoable for me. I have a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering and a minor in computer science. My day job is about 10#37; chemistry, 90#37; python data science stuff, and I'm really interested in machine learning and neural networks especially. 25 years old. Thoughts? Thank you so much! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am a masters student signed up for a course that is giving me an extreme amount of anxiety and stress. The course expects top-level conference quality projects, and right now I don't think I'm equip to deliver due to my lack of background knowledge. In addition, I have research of my own that is non-overlapping that I need to keep up with as well and the combination of these two is making me depressed. I talked to the instructor and she is currently helping me, but says I probably should not have registered (which is 100% true, although I met the prerequisites). I also talked to my advisor about possible options, and I left feeling humiliated and rejected. If I drop the course, I go under hours which is problematic due to my RAship , but if I stay there is a really high chance I will fail. I don't know who to turn to at this point. Has anyone had any similar experiences?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> In light of Vincente Mundo's death and the fact that violent crimes have happened in the past in the campus area, is there some group to join or place to go where I can learn to defend myself in a real pinch? I remember there being martial arts groups at Quad Day, I just didn't get any of their contact info. I also heard about a Krav Maga group in the community. Also, /u/UIpolice , would you have any tips for the citizen concerned that he might get mugged or something? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Ok so I can't seem to find any formal rush system at UIUC. So are there just generally open parties during the first 3 weeks of school? Do you hear about open parties/rush events through quad day or by word of mouth? Do the open events give you an opportunity to check out the frat before actual recruiting? Sorry, I'm transferring this year to Computer Engineering so I'm new to the system! Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My Illinois logo Nalgene of 5+ yrs slipped out of my bag's side-pocket, tumbled ~4 ft., and a chunk (about 1/4 of the bottom of the bottle) broke off on the cement. First I wept, and then I called and asked for a replacement. They sent me one, but they didn't have any with a logo. It was a dark blue bottle with [THIS]([url link] Illinois logo on it in orange, minus the blue border on the letters.  Anyone know where I can find one? Seen them in any of the book stores (I'm an alumn and not on campus)? Do you have one you'd be willing to sell? I loved this thing and need to start the healing process by putting some new stickers on a similar bottle.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> We are a real estate start-up in Rantoul looking for a kick ass developer! We got burned by one of our founders(stole our web files) so we are on the hunt for talent! Realty Sumo has an office in Rantoul, IL with 5 members of the staff working from this office. Our platform was already built out, but again, we got lost all of our files(they were stolen). We have clients, which makes this even harder. We also have partnerships with HouseFax and a few local realtor associations. We are looking for a dev who wants to be in a startup, who has the knowledge to build a CRM/Websites, and work towards a common goal! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out! Pay is negotiable, however we are looking for a partner.  We have equity(with a proper vesting schedule) and deferred pay. Having paying clients is also a good incentive! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I went to vote.illinois.edu and saw this referendum, but I'm not sure what exactly this referendum would do. Could anyone explain it to me?  The students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign hereby endorse the existing Student Fee Advisory Committee as the advisory body designated to provide recommendations regarding Student Initiated Fees to the Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on behalf of the student body. Furthermore, the students charge their representatives on the Student Fee Advisory Committee to maintain the highest standards of ethics, leadership, and service.  ` `   ` `  The SFAC shall be composed of the following individuals: (1) Six Undergraduate Students, nominated by the Illinois Student Senate; (2) Two Graduate Students, nominated by the Illinois Student Senate; (3) Two At-Large Students nominated by the Illinois Student Senate; (4) One staff member appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs; (5) The Treasurer of Illinois Student Senate, ex-officio; (6) Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Director of Auxiliary Services, Chair. In addition to reviewing and advising the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs regarding the Service Fee, General Fee, Health Fee and Housing Fee, the SFAC will review the components of the Student Initiated Fee and make recommendations to the Vice Chancellor relevant to increases, decreases or no change in the fee amounts. To the extent possible, the review of the components of the Student Initiated Fee will be completed in tandem with the renewal referendums outlined in the Student Code. SFAC recommendations will go to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs for consideration. The recommendations of SFAC and the Vice Chancellor will be presented to the Chancellor. An SFAC recommendation to initiate or discontinue a component of the Student Initiated Fee must be affirmed by student referendum. The expanded role of the SFAC shall be ratified upon majority approval of the student body at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in a referendum, and the charge will be enacted by the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs effective immediately upon ratification. <eos> \n",

It is a project of the Azubu Collegiate Champions, formerly known as the Collegiate StarLeague. This is the first ever season of CDL, so we have absolutely no idea who the favorites are, or who is going to win this game. The University of Illinois is being represented by several members of the Azubu Collegiate Champions team, so faithful viewers of the hwaitingillini stream will recognize familiar names such as monk, esiex, and mkfuba.

The map on the parking website is horrendous and doesn't clearly distinguish which are student lots. Also, if anyone has any better suggestions they'd be appreciated, as I'd rather not have to pay $660 a year to park. Thanks! <eos> \n",

There's no need to bring a partner--we'll get you dancing with people you just met there.

            "<bos> I keep overhearing that the student senate has become a place where our tuition is wasted on unnecessary things (they apparently tried to use 15000 dollars on robes for a black choir group..?) and that whenever a senator votes against an initiative that relates to minorities in anyway, he/she is called a racist, told \"quit your whining, thats privilege\" and \"practically booed of the floor\" as some users on this sub have shared. As a student, I would much rather have a senate that votes with reason and without some agenda fueled by bitterness towards parts of the UIUC population. I want senators who will vote on something not because \"it would be racist if you didn't\" but because it is a proper allocation of student funds. I am not part of the ISS, so these are just rumors to me. However I would like to know what everyone else here thinks. <eos> \n",

At worst, confusing enough to cause a crash. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all, So, I am an undergrad international student graduating this semester. I have been here for three and a half years.  - I haven't made any close friends. No close friends = No memorable moments - I did not travel at all in the US and did not go back home once while I have been here. Unlike most internationals undergrad students, I am on a scholarship and am poor as fuck even by third world countries' standard. - Due to a condition in my scholarship contract, I have to go back to my country and work couple of years there. So, I am not sure if I will ever come back here. Overall, saying that I have had a great time here would be a lie. What do you suggest for me to do to make my time here little bit memorable? Anything really, restaurants, activities, places, etc...  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I took econ 103 this past semester with Professor Baer. He said that the final grade was calculated as follows: 25% midterm, 30% final, 15% paper, 30% quizzes. I got a 81 on midterm, 94 on final, 95 on paper, and 100 quiz average and if you do out the math that equals to a 92.7. I emailed TA and he said final curve was: 97=A+, 90=A, 88=A-, 82=B+, 70=B, etc. so I should get an A right? My TA said that econ 103 uses some weird grading formula where they take all your scores and convert them to letters first. For example, my 81 on midterm would be converted to a B, and then multiplied by 25%, my 94 on final would be converted to an A, and then multiplied by 30%, etc. Somehow using this formula my TA said I ended up with an A- for the term. Is this kind of grading allowed? Basically what they're saying is an 82 on the midterm is the exact same thing as a 70 on the midterm since they're both considered \"B's.\" No grading formula was specified on the syllabus but this does not seem fair at all...I put in a ton of extra work after I got an 81 on the midterm, I recorded all the lectures, outlined every single chapter in the textbook, and even went to all the lectures even though it was early morning (if you've taken econ 103, you know how hard it is to stay awake in that class). Since my 81 on the midterm counts as a \"B,\" and B can mean anywhere from 70-82, I think this is what lowered my grade according to his formula. Who should I contact about this besides the professor? (He's not replying to my emails). Thanks Tl;dr Should've received A in class, professor's final grade protocol screwed me.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> CS 225 has been an interesting course for me this. However, with MP4 and the examlets I just feel so out of place in this course with no idea how to start. The Piazza answers don't tend to be very useful and spending hours in a TA queue when normally my question isn't answered is difficult. It doesn't help that for every other exam we basically get no study guide / practice version. Most of the people I know either walked into the class with significant experience or are similar struggling with all the examlets / MPs. Does anyone have additional resources for how to do well in this class / start on the MPs?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I find it hard to like my roommates. Prior to moving in, I told them my pet peeves, which is noise (specifically talking on the phone for a loooog time), and bad hygiene in the kitchen (like leaving dishes in the sink). This guy often talk out loud after 11pm and can go on for hours. Granted it doesn't happen everyday but still, I can hear him clearly and it can extend to 1am or later. We both sleep late so that's not the issue, but I think you should be stepping outside if you want to chat for so long.  They are also Chinese so they tend to cook a lot. I often see leaked liquid on the counter which is not only disgusting but also attracts bugs. (Don't meant to be racist, I'm Chinese too, but I grew up here so I'm fine with peanut butter sandwich) Am I being too judgmental? I brought ear plugs but the fact that I need to even have them makes me mad. How do I deal with this without making things awkward from now on?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> There's been an increase lately of major-specific questions here (primarily CS, for what it's worth.) A lot of these questions should be addressed towards your advisors, not redditors. Not only is it their job to tell you everything you need to know, but they will be more reliable than anyone on here.  It's also just annoying to see all these repetitive CS (and other) posts on here. Perhaps you need something like /r/uiucCS or one of the many Facebook groups related to specific majors or gen eds on campus. Please help keep this subreddita relevant.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi all- I'm an incoming freshman for the 2018 fall semester, I'd like some guidance on choosing a place to live. I haven't done something like this before so please forgive me if I don't know something that's common knowledge. I read over the \"Guide\" on this sub, and I have a few questions. Am I allowed to apply for the Private Certified Housing? If so, which one do you all recommend? I don't mean to sound snobby but... it would make a big difference for me if I could have my own bedroom. I've had problems with sharing rooms since I was young. If I am not allowed to apply for the Private Certified Housing, which of the other dorms do you all recommend? I'm looking at PAR and FAR, and they seem pretty good to me. Thank you all for your time. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I have not taken MATH 415 and I'm planning on taking it next semester, but I don't know if it's a smart choice. As far as I know, CS 357 relies heavily on MATH 415, but I will not take CS 357 anytime soon. Therefore, I don't know if I should push MATH 41 away (ideally a semester before I take CS 357, so the materials will be fresh). I'm thinking about taking STAT 400, CS 410, CS 411, CS 412, CS 374, CS 440, CS 446 or 498 AML in the next three or four semesters, before taking CS 357 (hence, MATH 415), and I don't know if any of those courses relies on MATH 415.  <eos> \n",

I've almost finished the book and it has really captured my imagination. In the past, the university library held a similar Bloomsday event, and I just figured Dublin O'Neil's would be the right place to hold such an event. I reached out to them to see if they are already doing something similar and if they'd be interested in hosting such an event.

That being said, I don't really know about many of the things that happen around here, because I am still not all that familiar with the town itself (didn't venture much off campus, or go out much in general). I'd like to poke my head out and see what there is to offer here, find some friends and who knows maybe get a relationship going. Either way it would beat sitting at home all the time.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For those who have taken ECE 492: Introduction to Parallel Programming, what is your opinion of the course? I'm trying to figure out if I want to take it because I really like parallel programming however I'm already quite familiar with MPI (at least the basics of it) and I'm not sure how much I'd get from the class. Another possibility for an advanced computing elective is ECE 428. I assume from descriptions that this also has to deal with parallel programming in a more loosely distributed sense and seems more challenging. If you have taken that course, what was your opinion? <eos> \n",

I'm horrible at math, I get horrible anxiety taking the exams ( yes, even with DRES extra time and diff place accommodations I still get below a 30%... so anything would be helpful.

            "<bos> For some context: I was at the concert and had one beer beforehand. Unbeknownst to me, I had been locking my legs -- no clue for how long -- and right when Big Gigantic came on, I fainted. (Don't lock your legs, kids) According to my girlfriend, it was an immediate collapse, and I lost consciousness twice.  Anyway, I don't know if you even spoke to me, but I want to thank you for helping my friends get me outside. If you're a redditor, I hope that you see this and know that I greatly appreciate your help. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope that you had a great time afterwards!  TL;DR: I fainted from leg-lock at Big Gigantic and want to thank the woman who helped my friends get me out.  Edit: Apparently leglock is a wrestling move haha no wrestling competitions, just kept my legs completely straight for too long. I'm totally fine; no health issues caused this. <eos> \n",

It is a very quick and easy survey, and he desperately needs responses. Please consider taking it and possibly sharing it with your friends.

            "<bos> Hello I am offering guitar lessons. I'm an undergrad here at UIUC and I have been playing guitar for around 7 years and been teaching for 3 years. I teach and plan according to what you want to learn from just learning songs to music theory and both acoustic and electric. It's a great opportunity for people who have always wanted learn guitar to start learning. I'll often teach in the Ikenberry Commons or one of the lounge rooms in Snyder Hall. My rates are $12 for 30 mins and $20 for an hour. (Which is cheaper than most lessons!) I always have my first lesson free for you to check out my teaching style and if you want to stick with me then that's great, if not that's fine as well. PM me for more details Thanks! Hope to hear from you soon!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I was looking at the transfer requirements, and I saw that it's easier to transfer into Stats and CS from outside UIUC than in. From outside, you have to get a 3.20, and only take CS125, but if you already go to UIUC, it takes a 3.67 GPA minimum, and you have to take CS125, 173 ANS 225. Why is this the case? Shouldn't it be easier for students who already go here to transfer in? <eos> \n",

But, seeing as I might come here next Fall, I wanted to start getting an idea of how good the basketball team is/will be (I already know football is pretty much ass). How did you guys do last year? Do you have any new recruits that are expected to make an impact? I know big 10 is a hard place to ball, but how are we looking compared to other big ten programs (terps, hawkeyes, etc)... I know this school was STELLAR when Deron Williams was here, so is there any chance of rising to that level again in the next 4-5 years? <eos> \n",

As I was looking for a subreddit for U of I I saw the post that says not to come to U of I if you're thinking of going into the Undeclared major. I realize that Undeclared and Undecided Engineering are two different paths, but has anybody experienced trouble with the Undecided Engineering path? <eos> \n",

There's no way I can afford a full year since I'm graduating early and there's no way I want to hang out with incoming freshman at the six pack, with an RA that wants to be my \"buddy\" and somehow always manages to find where I'm sitting at meals and wants to join. <eos> \n",

I just feel it shouldn't be so difficult and complicated to log in, view your grades, and see them all in one place. Is this something that students can pressure administration to move toward?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at UIUC, and I have some questions about the process when it comes to purchasing textbooks: -When do professors typically have their book selections listed? I've looked on the Bookstore website and some of my courses are still waiting for a list of book recommendations. -Where else besides the Illini Union Bookstore can I find the professor's book selections for the year? -What's the process to picking up books? Can we pick them up from the Union Bookstore, or do they have to be mailed to us? -Do we have to pay online for the textbooks, or can we pay on campus at the bookstore? -I personally haven't ordered my books yet, not even the required ones. Is it already late for me to order the books? If not, when should I at least have ordered my required books?  If anyone could answer any of these questions, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks so much. <eos> \n",

It looks like a great deal for 4 bedrooms on the first floor of a house with a yard, but the maintenance is absolutely HORRENDOUS. The worst part is that it's not even the maintenance worker's fault. I know they would love to fix everything, but Green St. refuses to allow them to make the correct purchases so they half-ass everything only for it to break later. Issue 1: I told them the floor was rising in the kitchen 2 years ago. They said it was normal (really? you would leave a mound in your kitchen? Yea right.). 2 years later, water finally started seeping everywhere and they replaced the faulty dishwasher, and all of the kitchen tiles have cracked.  Issue 2: The AC is terrible. They focus all of the cooling/heating in the entryway where no one lives (multiple apartments in the house), and the bedrooms have no airflow. Finally went to check myself, an entire AC ventilation shaft is hanging freely and venting into the basement... I called them last year to check on it, and they said it was working 100%. Seeing as how my AC bills have not changed from last year to this year, I wouldn't be surprised if this vent was hanging the past two years. My room is 84*F right now while the entry way is a cool 76*F. DO NOT RENT THIS APARTMENT. <eos> \n",

I was on the waitlist for CS 242 forever but i haven't gotten a response, so I figured that ship has already sailed and instead I should be taking at least one 400 level CS tech elective on top of what I presently have and put 242 off til next semester. But the problem is, all the 400 level electives are at capacity. I assume that as syllabus week goes by some will open up, but for now is it okay to leave my schedule at is, with only 8 credit hours, or should i pad in some random placeholder classes to get to 12 credit hours?  <eos> \n",

I get that finals are in two weeks, but the weather's nice, why the hell are you all doing weed indoors? Especially in the dorms, where they're trying to crack down on all the weed incidents and you live with everyone else stressing about finals/projects in an enclosed space. <eos> \n",

Don't have your head buried in your phone; oblivious to everything around you. * Don't step out into traffic unless you are sure the drivers are going to stop. I don't care if you have the right of way, make sure you aren't stepping out in front on an inattentive driver. * Don't walk in the bike lanes. Treat them like you would the street. Look both ways before crossing them and don't use them like a sidewalk. Conversely, avoid riding your bike on the sidewalk when at all possible. * Try not to crowd around the door to a lecture hall right before your class starts. This makes it take longer for people leaving the previous lecture and slows everyone down. * Try to be a decent human being in general. Realize that you are part of a community 40,000 people strong that for the most part live and work in a relatively small area.  Feel free to add anything I missed down below and have a great semester!  <eos> \n",

I posted in about all UIUC groups that I am a part of, but no-one has contacted me about it yet. It is kind of a burden on me now, cause it is really expensive, and I would like to return it to whoever it belongs to. Is there an official place at UIUC where you can turn in lost things?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Basically there are 13 of us living in a 15 bedroom house (14 tenants though) and we are looking for one more room mate since our friend dropped out. It is 15 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 2 kitchens, spacious living room, the works. Rent is $350 a month and it doesn't include utilities, but since we are splitting utilities 14 ways, they are very cheap. It is located at 804 West Oregon in Urbana, its on Oregeon and Lincoln basically. As far as the 13 of us, we aren't very crazy and we don't plan on throwing more than a couple parties. Most of us are sophomores in the engineering school (I'm civil myself) and we are just really chill people. We're very courteous people, most of us just play video games in our spare time, usually only get crazy on the weekends. If you are worried about our age, my girlfriend who is a senior brings her friends to hang out with us all the time because we are pretty funny to be around haha. P.S. We do have a couple ents in the house, and if you are into that, one of the open rooms is on the floor with them. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Me and my roommates have been living in a CPM apartment for this past year now (I know that CPM is bad but they have very affordable apartments) and we've had a pretty sizeable leak in our apartment for about a year now. All of last year we would regularly complain about our leak to CPM but they classified it as a non-emergency because it \"wasn't leaking while it wasn't raining.\" Over the summer they said that they would fix the leak but we all came back the leak had gotten much worse and our apartment reeked of mold.  Our roommate hasn't had a bed to stay in for the past two nights and two people have gotten sick after staying in our apartment. My roommate vomited this morning (she hadn't been drinking) and for all we know it could've been because of the mold. We have gone to the CPM office and complained and they keep saying that they will do something but haven't so far. If you are reading this now, first and foremost DO NOT SIGN A LEASE WITH CPM. Secondly, this might be a really dumb question, but could we at least successfully file a formal complaint with the tenant union? Are there other options for us at this point? If you wanna berate us for signing a lease with CPM feel free, we honestly probably deserve it.  For clarification, we resigned our lease before the leak started and we saved pictures of the progression of the leak and all of our complaints as well.  <eos> \n",

I know I could rent, but why not try and see if the r/UIUC community can help me. Would the check out window have these two lenses? Does anybody in the Champaign-Urbana area have either of these lenses?  edit: I'm not an Art and Design Student...  edit2: called the window ... they only have Canon mounted lenses (thanks silent_spring). does anybody on campus have one of these lenses? we could meet on the quad. <eos> \n",

I've also heard that T-Mobile and Verizon are pretty good, but since they don't have too many deals, is there a disadvantage with going to an MVNO carrier like [MintSim]([url link]  Lastly, are US Cellular and ATT any good?

Apparently they don't reserve tickets for attendees, and they gave mine away to other students who need more than 4 tickets. My parents traveled across the globe just to attend my graduation.

I've seen fans get together to form Star Wars clubs at other universities, but I haven't found anything comparable here. I think it could be a fun group, so I'm thinking about starting one if enough people are interested.  Here are some ideas I've had so far for possible activities: * Collecting and trading Star Wars collectibles. I've actually seen quite a few clubs specifically devoted to SW collecting. * Having discussions or roundtables about our favorite SW topics. * Starting a SW book club. * Organizing parties to go watch the new movies or TV shows. * Screenings of the older films. * Playing all the SW videogames and/or holding tournaments. * Fundraising to help us attend conventions. * Holding costume competitions. * Getting together for an annual SW marathon before the release of the newest film. * SW trivia contests.  Plus, some other thoughts depending on level of interest and engagement: * Maybe something special for Halloween or May the Fourth? * Taking a page from the official campaign and raising money or volunteering in some capacity to be a \"Force for Change\" in the community? * Hosting talks or discussions to explore the more academic side of SW (i.e. its cultural and literary legacy, use of classical mythology, etc)? * If we're really devoted, starting our own podcast?  These are just some initial thoughts. I'm open to any suggestions. If you think you'd be interested, let me know! Or pass this on to your SW-obsessed friend. We would be honored if you would join us. *Edit:* if you’re interested in joining, message me for a link to the GroupMe!  <eos> \n",

Peoria Charter might not have the most frequent times, but they definitely treat their customers better. Therefore, I am BEGGING my fellow Illini to boycott Suburban Express. You can see from the link above the UIUC subreddit all the horrible things they've done to UIUC students, just look at the way they treat dissatisfied customers on Yelp (responses courtesy of the rude CEO himself). Take a second to read about how abusive this company is, and decide for yourself.  <eos> \n",

The first assignment caught me off guard, not necessarily because it was difficult, but I do not understand the notations at all. The induction is way out of the league of knowledge from 173. Reading the notes and rewatching the lectures do not help at all. Right now I'm just sitting in front of desk and staring at the homework for the whole afternoon. Is there any way out of this suffering? <eos> \n",

I am hoping to compare insurance offered relative to other sources in terms of best coverage, best value, and lowest annual cost. Although I have been to both McKinley and Carle, I don't mind McKinely; however, I am concerned about out-of-state coverage if I end up in the hospital or need a doctor urgently in another state.  Please let me know your thoughts.  <eos> \n",

It was stolen out of our basement. So, please just take a look at this picture in case you see it around: [url link] Some easily identifiable unique features: * It's a teal-colored Colnago (bike experts might call this Bianchi Blue/Celeste... Colnagos are never this color) * Downward-pointing handlebars * White tires, white seat, white headlight <eos> \n",

            "<bos> In case you need more of a clear picture, your license plate starts with \"E94\" I met up with your car around Bolingbrook, IL around 10 am... I saw you immediately veer towards rumble strips and swerve violently back onto road- as if you were texting and driving. I let it go, as I thought 'she will probably be shaken up by that so she will stop'. Once we both got on 57, I saw you do it at least 2 more times at which point I said \"I am going to get pass her\" because I wanted no part of whatever car wreck you were going to cause by your carelessness nor did I want to endanger my wife and daughter who were in the car with me. At that time, you were going about 76-78. As soon as I got around your car, you decided you were going to shoot up to 90 and not let me pass... lowering your speed back down to upper 70s once I backed off. This not only happened with me, but I saw you do this to multiple people. About 30 miles outside of Urbana, you maintained your 90 mph pace and went into the distance- which I was grateful for. Listen dude- I don't care if you want to endanger your life, but do it away from others. Act like a college student and not like a petulant child.  You don't deserve to be here right now- you deserve to be living with mom and dad, being driven around without a driver's license until you finally understand the value of life- yours and others.  rant over.... <eos> \n",

However, I find it hard to believe that one of the biggest party colleges in the country does not have a decent rave scene. I already know about LIC and The Canopy Club. Where are the ravers or kandi kids at though? If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm a sophomore in aerospace right now, and I'm doing pretty well in 213 (yes, even after that redonkulously hard midterm) and saw that I'd need 4 more physics classes after 213 for a physics minor. This would scare the hell out of me if I thought they'd be anything like 211 or 212, but it seems like there's not as many labs/all that SmartPhysics bullshit. I actually enjoy having material presented and learning it on my own for the most part. Is it even worth it? Would a physics minor on a resume help me get a job any more than if I didn't have it? Anyone with a physics/other applicable minor have any input on this? <eos> \n",

I don't have a thermometer to check my temperature but the sore throat has persisted for about 2/3 days now and I think that's what it is.  Help please? Although I can take the midterm, I really am finding it difficult to study right now and I'm miserable. If I actually do have strep, will I be excused from the exam? Even if I take the test though I'd like to get some antibiotics and I don't know how to do that at McKinley.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> We are seeking undergraduates interested in smart transportation systems research, including traffic simulation, data analytics, and traffic sensing platforms. The research will be supervised by Professor Dan Work as well as CEE graduate students Yanning Li and Raphael Stern.  Several sensor networks have been developed to monitor traffic in construction zones to improve safety and reduce delays. This project aims to investigate how to design these systems more effectively by leveraging cheap computing and large data streams from low cost sensor networks. As part of the project, we will be modeling two construction zones from Illinois freeways in the state of the art traffic micro simulation software, AIMSUN. The models will be calibrated with sensor data from radar sensors deployed at the site, and massive simulations will be performed to understand how to improve future traffic sensor network deployments.  Requirements: •\tBasic knowledge of traffic flow theory (CEE310 or CEE416). •\tBasic knowledge of micro-simulation (preferred). •\tInterest in transportation research and micro-simulation. •\tStrong computational skills and willingness to learn new software. •\tApproximately 10-20 hours/week availability during this semester. Benefits: •\tGet paid while having fun and learning new research skills. •\tLearn how to model, calibrate, and simulate smart transportation systems using the cutting-edge AIMSUN micro-simulation software.  If you are interested, please send an email to Yanning Li (yli171@illinoi.edu). Include your major, current year of study, relevant coursework, and an attached resume with your GPA. Applications should be sent by January 30th, 2015.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just can't STAND Computer Science. I went into the program with only AP CS (no other experience), and I thought I would be decent at CS, since I'm good at math. AP CS wasn't too bad; not my favorite class, but I just assumed my interest in the field would deepen through college. Far from it. Last semester, I just couldn't bear to sit through CS 125. I hate everything about programming; it isn't fun or interesting to me, the software we use is confusing to me, and I overall just dread everything about it. Now I'm in CS 225, and the problems I have are 10x worse because it's in a language that I haven't learned before and uses the terminal, which I have never experimented with before. I can barely make myself go to class; I ended up skipping most of my classes last semester because I just couldn't get myself to move. I don't know how I can get through another semester without completely losing my mind. There's no way in hell I can stay in CS for much longer.  And the worst part is, I feel so guilty whenever I go on this sub and see all of the posts from people trying to transfer into CS, who are all obviously passionate about the field. Compared to me, who has a spot in the program but with no experience, passion, or interest, those people are definitely being snubbed. They deserve to be in this program much more than I do; I feel like I'm stealing their spot.  What's wrong with me? <eos> \n",

I would prefer a non-smoker. I'm a fairly social and active person - board or card games, bar trivia, biking, running, tennis, etc. I don't host big parties, but I occasionally have small groups over. I'm also a semi \"townie\" and went to undergrad and grad school here too, so I know a lot about the Champaign-Urbana area. I'm a tidy person, but I don't mind a few dishes in the sink or papers lying around; however, I would like you to clean up after yourself in the general sense.  2 friendly cats 2-story house 2 bedrooms (The 2nd bedroom has a queen bed and a dresser. You will need to provide a desk, bookshelf, nightstand, or anything else you would like in your room. The bedroom also has two large closets.) 2 bathrooms Semi-furnished basement with \"game room\" Washer and dryer 3 car garage (one space has my ping-pong table though) Plenty of storage Rent - $475 a month per person Utilities - $75 per person in the summer, up to $200 a month per person (heat is expensive in winter). I don't currently have cable, but I'm open to the idea. The house is about 1.5 miles from both Beckman and the Illini Union. The Green bus line goes directly in front of the house, which goes to downtown Champaign, campus, and downtown Urbana. Some pictures of the house: [url link] I met my current roommate (amoghpb) over Reddit. Feel free to PM him or myself if you have any questions. <eos> \n",

I don't know much about what being a CA entails and there doesn't seem to be much information about it online. From what I could tell over the past semester, the CA just helped during my lab section but I don't know what other kinds of responsibilities I would have or even anything about the process to become a CA. Could anybody shed some light on this for me? Thank you! <eos> \n",

He's adorable, used to living with other animals, and not needy or destructive. I can offer some payment, although not a ton as I'm a generally poor grad student. Thanks a ton! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys,  My name is Kyle and I'm the president of the newly formed Muay Thai Club at UIUC RSO (Very unofficially known as Illini Muay Thai). Firstly, I'm sorry we are starting so late in the semester! We are a sports and martial arts club focused on Muay Thai. For those of you unaware of it, you can think of it as kickboxing but with knees and elbows as well. It is one of the fundamentals of the striking of many MMA and K-1/GLORY fighters and is also a rich cultural tradition that has been passed down for many generations.  We meet at the ARC Combat Room during the following **times**: 3/3 - 5/7 *Tuesday, Thursday 4:30-6:30PM *Saturday 6:00-8:00PM  We will provide a respectful, family-like environment where anyone will be welcome! We invite all levels of involvement. Do you want to work out hard? Do you want to learn a new martial art? Self-defense? Challenge yourself? Any and all are welcome.  We have the room booked officially from 3/3 to the end of the semester during these times, but we are holding some unofficial practices during those times for the next week, starting tomorrow at 6PM.  Please let me know if you have any questions, and if your interested please check us out on facebook, at Illini Muay Thai <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm transferring as a junior for EE, and there is an admitted transfer student day this Thursday. It doesn't seem to be required, so I'm wondering if anyone here has gone to it and can comment on what it's like. Is it basically a visit day, with campus tours and free food; or is it more like orientation where I'll actually learn some things like who my advisor would be, how to start planning my schedule given that fact that I'm transferring in a lot of credits, etc.? I'm near Chicago and can stay at a friend's UIUC apartment, so it's not like I need to buy flight tickets and get a hotel room. But if it's more or less just a campus visit, then I might reconsider the trip and wait until the actual orientation day. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Please do not EVER leave your crap on a desk unattended. We get multiple people multiple times a week that come down and say their stuff was taken while they went to the bathroom or got food or slept. Leave your stuff only if you have a friend who is watching it, otherwise take it with. You know the North entrance circulation desk? Even when we go back to the circ desk we take all our stuff with us. Even employee's belongings have been taken if we weren't watching it. Do not save desks. This is particularly hated because your junk gets stolen and then you are sad. We do not like to see you sad. Hence, do not save desks. The people with the clickers are just doing a patron count. It happens every three hours and is essential to determining funding for Grainger for the next year, so while I know it annoying for two minutes, it means you have more 24-hour places to study next year. Late fees on reserve books are serious shit. We do write down exactly when the book was given back so returning it four hours late with people waiting to check it out and then trying to tell us a week later you turned it in on time will not fly. If someone is being loud and obnoxious or talking on their cell phone (YES even on the fourth floor), come down to the circ desk and tell us. We will happily warn them and, if necessary, invite them to study somewhere else. Also the study rooms on the fourth floor: these are designed for group use. Group meaning more than one person. If there is a group who wants to study and we see multiple rooms being taken up by one person, we are supposed to kick you out. Also, you cannot check out the three locked study rooms on a whim. You need a reservation and to fill out a form 24 hours in advance EVEN if no one is in it or scheduled to use it. We do not have study rooms to check out to people because people wrecked them, filled them with trash, and drew on the walls. <eos> \n",

I wonder as it's not exactly a big city. It'd be ironic that I couldn't play any bluegrass in the US compared to Australia! One more thing, do people usually mind other people practicing their instruments in dorms? Any responses would be appreciated. edit: I found an ad for a jam at Lincoln Square mall every Tuesday.

However, as I look over posts here, my confidence is starting to sink. Is there a good alternative major for those who don't get into Information Systems? If not, how difficult is it to get noticed by the college of business? TLDR: Good alternative for Information Systems or difficulty on getting into College of Business? <eos> \n",

It's best to call UHC and double check with your plan, but last I checked (a couple days ago), we're completely covered for the cost of yearly checkups (pap, gynecology exam, STI tests, etc.), IUDs, implanon, depo provera, various BCPs, Plan B, and even for getting our tubes tied. I'm not sure about the coverage for abortion, and I think there are some stipulations such as only being 100% covered in the case of rape. Again, best to call UHC directly and ask.  There's a Planned Parenthood right by County Market. They provide excellent service and are staffed with discreet, caring, kind, and very good doctors and staff. As a student, if you have limited income, it's highly likely that you will not have to pay any kind of copay - i.e. your entire visit may end up free of cost aside from if you're given tests and medications outside of normal coverage. However, if you are able, please do support the organization with a small donation as they provide invaluable service to women around the country.  Planned Parenthood provides much *much* better care than McKinley. I cannot emphasize enough how much the services offered at Planned Parenthood are both more comprehensive but also more skillfully carried out.  Take care of yourselves and don't be afraid to ask for help or go to PP. And always use condoms even if you have an IUD, are on BCP, etc, or in a long term relationship. Shit happens. Condoms are the best way to prevent contracting an STI short of maintaining *total* abstinence.  <eos> \n",

I heard that if I get a GPA under 2.00, I'll get an academic probation, warning me to get a GPA over 2.00 for the next semester or I will get kicked out.(right?) So my question is will an academic probation prevent me from transferring into ECE? <eos> \n",

I've been here for two years and feel as though I know people, but don't really know people or they do not have the same motivation as me. I thought college wasn't only about the people you know, but the quality of people you know that will be your lifelong friends, but this is not the case. Any suggestions or recommendations that I should do to find new friends on campus? I'd really like to feel as though I am in someone's \"clique\" on campus instead of feeling alone and getting all these awards. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

This migration is taking place in order to align Engineering with the rest of campus in terms of billing for printing on a pay-per-use basis, tracking print jobs, and establishing a common monetary balance that students can use for print services across campus. This effort is aimed at streamlining print services and providing a more consistent printing experience for students across campus.  Web-based Printing will also be migrated to PaperCut, as will existing Engineering students' print balances. Moving forward, printing balances can be replenished through Illini Cash. Engineering IT’s EWS Printing page has been updated to reflect these changes: [url link] Have a great summer. -EngrIT Outreach <eos> \n",

But, though I am going to try my best to bargain with financial aid office, I know I most likely will not be able to afford or attend, and it's making me feel really shitty because of how much I love the school and the program.

The professor will ostensibly be different, sure, but it'd be great to hear some ideas of what I (and others) can do to prepare over the break. For example, I've heard \"Brush up on your C programming.\" Anything like that (or more specific stuff) will probably help a lot of people hit the ground running. <eos> \n",

As I'm deciding whether or not I want to accept UIUC's offer over other universities, I'm wondering if Information Systems is a major that would allow me to get a balance between the two fields of CS and business. Additionally, is there anything about this major that sets it apart from the rest of the business majors at UIUC? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> When you come to college/high school/that new hot yoga class it can be really easy to gravitate to similar groups of people or those you already know because putting yourself out there in a sea of new people, in other words, doing something you haven't done before is terrifying.  International students are exposed to an entire different culture and a whole different world while also attending college for the first time just like the rest of us. It's incredibly safe to not go out of your way and put yourself out there in what can seem like a different planet.  The vast majority speak fluent English, have unique stories/cultural background/interests, and most importantly have so many things in common with us. We're all human beings and I can't recall the last time I initiated a conversation before class starts or on the street when I didn't have a pleasant conversation or get help/learn better when discussing lectures or problems. Sure, not every single guy/girl is going to be receptive and you won't hit it off but who cares? I had trouble my first semester in college because I wasn't used to the lack of interacting with classmates regularly five times a week and getting to college where you barely recognize 20 people in lecture just made things really stressful until I found some good friends.  I've only taken two psych classes and unfortunately I don't remember too much from them so this might be incorrect usage but I don't think that it's confirmation bias when almost every international student I've talked to has been a complete homie.  Of course, it would be nice if international students also did the same though its harder for them but hey this post is far too long and my Jalapeño Poppers are ready so tldr: international students are dopeass motherfuckers. go out of your way and hittemup tldr2: if you don't do this and you're a freshmen, enjoy closing the door on 30% of your possible friendships <eos> \n",

My grade in Math 347 is fairly poor(received consecutive D’s on both midterms) however I don’t believe it’s the content. I always walk out the exams knowing which questions were wrong and how to solve them afterwards just blank out or make overly dumb mistakes during test time. I plan on spending several hours each day preparing for the final in hopes to make these proofs second nature and to get a C in the class in total. My question is how much does this hurt me for future classes and transcript wise in all say? Appreciate any feedback. Edit: Received an A- in Calc 3, doesn’t have much relevance though lol. <eos> \n",

In retrospect I shouldn't have walked home at 3am alone, it's what ended up being the reason why I just got mugged. Please be safe, travel in groups, use safe rides/ safewalks!

But I've always been confused why more people don't take the train. It costs $15 if you buy your ticket a week or two in advance and then maybe another $5-$10 if you want to take a commuter to a suburb. So it's pretty much cheaper and more convenient, so I don't know why more people don't take the train? P.S. I am not an Amtrak lobbyist, just an Amerrrrican and a patriot. <eos> \n",

I'd like to create a post that details the down-ballot choices that local voters will see -- for example, state senators/representatives, local county positions, and referenda. It is my understanding that voters may not know as much about these races as the bigger ones. First, does something like this exist already? If so, then of course it is not worth to replicate. If not, and you'd like to volunteer to research and submit *positive* blurbs on a candidate or candidates that detail their *policy priorities*, or if you'd like to write about a particular referendum, please PM me or comment here.

I am having trouble in deciding between decision  controls sciences and data analytics. When I say controls, I would majorly take robotics, AI/ML and ECE courses. Does anyone have a clue about the jobs outlook in both fields. Any insight would be helpful! P.S. I am international student. Also, i have not taken up a lot of ECE courses in my undergrad, so I am worried about the transition. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For those non-CS students interested in registering for CS courses, you may be interested in the course restrictions that are in place on our various courses, and when the restrictions will be lifted. The complete policy is posted here: [url link] We regret that we cannot offer as many seats as there is demand. We've been struggling to grow as a department as our student body grows, and as interest in CS grows, but our increase in capacity has been lagging for a variety of reasons. I believe though that the situation is improving. For the last several years, the number of 400-level seats we've been offering has been increasing by about 20% each year. And, the number of seats for 400-level courses for spring 2015 will be over 45% higher than for spring 2014. <eos> \n",

Is there ANY way around this? I barely remember any Spanish so the situation is basically I would have to take 3 semesters of it starting over. I'm already trying to minimize the amount of time to graduate (I'm old, this is my 2nd BS) and I just found this out today.  For those who will want to say just take the classes and move on, without going into details, this requirement is enough to sabotage me going there. Did anyone else have a similar experience? Any insight would be appreciated. I have yet to speak to a counselor about it because I have a million other problems to deal with too but it is now at the top of my list. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Long story short, fire alarms in my apartment have been beeping because of low power batteries. I attempted to replace the batteries and it stopped beeping shortly after. After a week, a different alarm was beeping and I repeated the process. It seems that the second alarm did not end well, because D1 Networks(the fire alarm company for my landlord) claimed that the battery swap broke the alarm and came by to fix it. I didn't put much thought to this whole process, until they charged me one hundred dollars because I \"tampered\" a fire alarm and my landlord is trying to pass the charge on me. However, when they did show up and try to fix the supposedly broken alarm, I asked them to replace the rest of the batteries for me, they straight up told me to do it myself. Now, what the fuck am I suppose to do in this scenario? Clearly they are unwilling to replace batteries for my fire alarm, and when I do their fucking job instead I got charged a hundred dollars for it. Is this legal? <eos> \n",

I’d appreciate anything from meal to snack ideas. Did you ever buy things at 57 North or eat at the dining hall? Did you go grocery shopping and what did you buy? Any help is appreciated! I understand it’s slightly difficult to eat well in University Housing which is why I’m asking. <eos> \n",

There was a whole serious of callbacks / call and response through the song, for example shouting \"beer!\" over \"rye\" during the lyric \"whiskey and rye\".

            "<bos> Just got my security deposit back today, all $2 that was left. When we moved in, our apartment had all sorts of problems. There were nail holes all over the walls, a big hole in one wall, the oven still had oven cleaner inside it like nobody bothered wiping it out...it wasn't terrible, but it had problems. My wife and I annotated everything on the damage report when we moved in. When we moved out, it was in much better condition than what we found it in. They charged us almost $300 to paint, despite us fixing some of the existing wall problems, then another $150 or so for \"general cleaning,\" even though there was nothing to clean. With some other bogus charges, they got us down to $2 of our security deposit. Aside from them showing our apartment while we were still in it, we had no real problems until this. There may not be better options, but be warned and don't expect your security deposit back. Update: after calling them, a manager called me back the next day. He found the damage report, saw that the walls were messed up, and did not charge us for painting. He also noticed that the place was clean so he wanted to split the cleaning bill, even though he said the only thing that needed cleaned was inside the oven, which we had cleaned, then behind/under the fridge and oven, which was also did. $350 back is alright, but we really shouldn't have to pay anything. <eos> \n",

We have flown under the radar here for generations, but that wasn't a problem because that was the kind of house we were.  Starting last year our house started to get vandalized. Innocent pranks. Our 200 pound letters would get tipped over, maybe someone would spray paint something on our house. Annoying but we ignored it. We cleaned up the spray pain, we picked back up the letters. Then someone broke our sign. We turned the other cheek, and fixed it. This happened again, and again, and again. We complained during IFC presidents council but no one there really cared. If anything, it got worse. Still, every week I'd be outside with a shovel, a hammer, and some nails to fix our sign. Then someone stole our sign. Annoying, but there are worse things. Signs, letters, paint, that's all replaceable. Someone even stole our composite picture. Annoying and an expensive replacement, but what could we do.  Over the break we were having maintenance work done on the house. I guess at some point in time the workers left the door open because someone went into our Alumni room and stole one of our relics. The oldest relic we had, a booklet signed by our founding members with the bios of our first 200 members. Worthless by conventional standards, but priceless to our house. Bound to sit in some fraternity's glory chest along with a stolen Pike composite and a road sign.  Why the rivalry between Greek groups? Some of it's just pranks and in jest, but stealing a 100 year old piece of history like that? It makes me sick to think that I belong to a similar organization as you. You piece of shit. You stole something with actual meaning just as a joke. Something irreplaceable. I hope you think about it when you're 30 and feel terrible. I hope it haunts your dreams and gives you agita. I hope you grow a pair and return it because you know if someone stole something important to you, you'd want it back more than anything else.  Seriously, fuck you.  Sincerely, A disappointed and pissed off brother. <eos> \n",

I am actually doing pretty well in the other classes and I am sure that I would be over at least a 1 on my semester gpa and over 2 on my overall gpa with the school but under 2 for my semester GPA. My question to you good people today is that has anyone ever been on academic probation more than once? I have to say I am pretty worried that they are just going to kick me out for doing bad in one class. I have also had some health issues over the semester that have definitely not helped. Thanks for your time <eos> \n",

Over the past year I’ve been here, I’ve noticing that my conservice utility bill has been getting higher and higher for no real reason at all, specifically since I moved to another unit in their complex. Every time I call the company, I always get bullshit ass answers. For example, last month I got charged extra on the bill for moving to another unit, so I got charged for water/sewer/electricity from my old unit, ($70), that was understandable. So now this particular month it’s because of my usage as to why I’m getting $85. Shit, my parents pay about $100 a month back home in Chicago and they have a damn HOUSE. I’m not doing anything differently than what I did in the previous months. At my last unit, I didn’t pay no more than 45-50 on my utility bill. Oh and I forgot to mention this as well, one particular month, I got an extra $30-40 charge on top of the the Water/Sewer/electricity charge for being here for over a year. What the fuck is that about?  It’s just not making any sense to me.  Then on top of all of that, I’ve been having problems with ants really bad.  Whatever you do, please DO NOT LIVE at ONE NORTH! Or “One Illinois” period. 😒 Don’t be a sucker like me. Read about them, and ask questions before you move into these places that suck students in with their so call “cheap rent”.

In case you missed it, Binny's decided to open its first location outside of the Chicagoland area down here in Champaign, and it's been under construction since late Fall. It is located at the old Boarder's building at the corner of Prospect and Town Center Blvd, just north of the Target. Although no announcements have appeared online, I have a friend who works at Illini Media and he worked on an ad for the DI announcing the opening of Binny's this Friday.  So grab your Binny's card and head up north! Finally an alternative to the slightly overpriced selection of Friar Tucks down in Savoy.  <eos> \n",

I heard that there is like only one gay bar, but I don't know true that is. Coming from Chicago, I'm hoping there is some diversity in the people and some form of entertainment. I know Allen hall is like the LGBT place to be, but I don't plan on living there as a freshman. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Fast forward three decades, and Rentertainment and I are celebrating our 30th Anniversary! It's been a great run – fabulous employees, amazing customers, tons of fun – thank you all. But now, as someone once said, “I'm ready to roll the end credits – ready for the curtain call” – it's time to do something else. As we firm up our plans to sell off Urbana-Champaign's very best collection of films, let me share with you some details of our transition: - We'll keep getting new releases through the end of June. - We will continue renting films through the end of July. - We will start selling off our inventory on Monday, June 15th. - Rather than price each film individually, we'll set a price (which will lower regularly) and sell everything at that price. A few box sets will be pulled and priced individually. - If you have a block, use what you can/want between now and the end of July. Starting August 1st, we'll buy back any remaining block rentals. More details to follow. Meanwhile, thanks again for a great three decades of That’s Rentertainment! Geoff. <eos> \n",

Is this the kind of thing the counseling center could help with? I know they usually deal with students suffering from depression or anxiety, but I'll take any help I can get.

The bar actually just gave it to the police, it was never in my possession. the cop has asked me to come talk about it and if I cooperate he will only give me a city ordinance. However I'm wondering if I deny this, what will happen? even though im assuming it has my name and picture it is not mine, im thinking someone stole my identity to avoid getting into trouble of their own. If I deny that it is mine can I still get in trouble? I have read that this is a felony in Illinois and am wondering if I should just take the fine? I cannot afford a lawyer for court. please help. <eos> \n",

I know there's one on campus, but from what I gather, it's not open in the summer.  Is it worth it for a regular gym goer to pay more for one of the expensive buildings with fitness centers? What are some cheaper options with gyms that I may have missed? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Greetings and Salutations! Back in January, I applied to transfer from out of state into the Advertising department. Now, I very well may not get in, so I, of course, have back-up schools: Indiana University and Ball State. My question isn't whether I should major in Advertising (Unless anyone has valid reasons why I shouldn't, in which case, please speak up), but rather if the cost of tuition here is worth the degree.  I am fully aware of the great things UIUC has to offer, as this is why I applied in the first place. However, while waiting for an admissions decisions, I have thought about more practical matters. Obviously the school has great resources and opportunities, and based on my readings, appears to have many acclaimed majors, but I haven't found too much on the Advertising program. The website makes it sound like a great program, but I find student opinions to be less biased in regards to such things. Of course, a good education is worth the money, and I am aware that the tuition is not bad when compared to many schools, but is the Advertising program here worth the money, or would I be better off at one of the Indiana schools, which both seem to have good programs at a smaller cost? Due to living with my mom, I would be getting In-State tuition for either state, so the cost difference between them is about 5 to 6 thousand, but depending on the quality of the program here, that could make a world of difference for both parties.  Obviously the extra money is worth spending if the program's education and post-grad opportunities are great. But are they? The school has made a name for itself, at least that's what I gathered, so is that worth it in itself? Is the experience and overall quality of simply going to UIUC worth it, regardless of the name and major? If anyone has any insight on these matter, I would be sincerely appreciative. Merci beaucoup! <eos> \n",

On a side note, assuming that there isn't one anymore, are there people here who would want to restart one? Apparently you get reimbursed for club expenses at 80%, which means as a club you could buy cigars and smoke them at a big discount. So, any takers?? <eos> \n",

Personally I am leaving behind a band, a youtube channel focused on music gear reviews, and a fledgling videography business.   That said?

Now, here I am, a quarter through first semester, and I've only learned the names of a few people. I've tried to be outgoing, but most people react weirdly or like they already have their group of friends decided. It's such a strange thing. I'm having so much trouble just connecting with anyone.  Does it get better? How did you meet your group of friends? When did you meet them? Any advice is appreciated.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Until now, I was set to transfer into the college of engineering and become a CS major. However, I've recently decided that the Stats  CS major is more for me. This means that I no longer need Physics 211, which leaves a big hole in my schedule when I drop it. Here's my current courseload: MATH 241 MATH 213 PHYS 211 ART 299 ATHRO 143 If I drop physics, I will only have 13 credit hours left, which is a little low (even though I have 3 hours of Calc II from the summer). Are there any classes I can pick up now (preferably one that is helpful to my major) which can fill the hole left by physics? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So, I was just sent an email accusing me of cheating in one of my CS classes this past semester. I was outraged at first and was gathering information to make my case that I did not cheat when I realized I unknowningly did in fact cheat. It wasn't on purpose in all honestly and it was an accident, but regardless to the university it is still cheating. I accidently submitted another person's code in place of mine for those who are wondering. My question regards my \"accomplice\" in this matter. I'm going to accept responsibility for the action that occured, but the person who is also being accused of helping me had absolutely no part in my mistake and I do not want that person getting in trouble for my mistake. If I state this in my email responding to the accusation do you think my so called \"accomplice\" will still get in trouble and what penalty will receive. P.S. I understand that cheating is bad and I did not have any intention of trying to submit the other person's code, so please refrain from scolding and name calling  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Thanks. It was 10-11 pm yet the quad was still full of people roaming around, playing Pokémon. I'm sure there were people like me who were kinda embarrassed at first, walking around and staring at our screens, throwing Pokéballs. But the amount of people I saw tonight all playing the same game, camping at the lure was amazing. It might be the novelty and hype of it, sure, but it was like an unintentional meet-up of players. Personally I thought it was really cool to see so many people gathered at night on campus by something which defined a generation, playing the same game just because some guy decided to put his money out for a lure.  So thanks for a surreal experience.  <eos> \n",

A bit of background, I'm a guy. I run a bit, but I want to start putting on muscle. I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to working with weights and lifting. I'm thinking about getting a trainer at least once a week to learn how to lift/so I don't kill myself, etc.  Anyway, any experiences, recommendations for trainers? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So as some of you know that in some classes that it is mandatory to buy a pack back subscription for 20$ for a semester. It is not a rip off in the sense that it cost money but in fact it is cheap unlike our stupid flipit physics and webassigns are (the school has enough money to make their own such programs and softwares that will provide students free of cost but they dont and that is why I am calling it ‘stupid’) . First let me give you guys a background about me. I have watched almost every show aired on shark tank since years and years and packback looks like one of them that I just cannot resist to say that their work ethics are terrible and how some professors endorse it is even ridiculous. Basically packback was funded by Mark Cuban as a startup which was started by some college undergrads at Illinois State University couple years ago. It is a website that wants students to be more curious by asking ‘good’ questions and answering question simple put it is for sparking ‘curiosity’. Now why is it a ripoff? Simple answer: we are forced to ask and formulate questions for points and answer questions that are not interesting to us. To be honest it is a simple ripoff where you ask a question/answer question get points or extra credit and they (packback) get their money. On top of that, their software sucks like literally sometimes I get deleted from ‘my community’ not because I didn’t use right email address but because it is the stupid software bugs. I would say that Chegg is way better than packback and it is best when it comes to asking questions and even renting books is better with chegg. I have reached the customer many times and also sometimes days go by no reply at all. Terrible service and terrible idea for sparking ‘curiosity’ by forcing students to ask questions that they are not interested in. Trust me students do this for a grade.  Let’s see who can help me change my perspective or support me with this topic? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Here's the e-mail I got from the ISSS: By July 1st, 2016, F-1 students and their dependents are required to have the updated version of the I-20 form. The new I-20 can be easily identified by the lack of a barcode that appeared in the top right corner of the old I-20’s. According to our records, you still have the older version of the I-20 form, so ISSS has created a new I-20 form for you. Since ISSS has reprinted over 5000 I-20’s, we will be handing out these I-20’s at the Illini Union, to ensure that we can accommodate all students. Please see below for information on how to get your new I-20: Go to Room 407 of the Illini Union, Tuesday, March 1st – Friday, March 4th from 10 am to 4 pm. Please do not visit the ISSS office for these documents- only regular I-20’s that were requested by you via iStart will be available at the ISSS office. Please remember that you will need to show photo ID when picking up your document. If you are out of town during this time and cannot pick up your I-20, we can mail your document to you. Please log in to iStart and under F-1 Student Services, choose and fill out the Mail My Reprinted I-20 e-form If you would like your friend to pick up your document on your behalf, please fill out the Mail My Reprinted I-20, and remember to choose “my friend will pick up I-20” from the menu. ISSS cannot release your document to a friend unless we receive permission from you to do so. <eos> \n",

A week before the grades were out, I got my official appointment letter for the research assistantship for the Spring semester and was guided through to make an account with the UI new hire as well.  Will my offer be cancelled now that I'm on a probation? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm an undergraduate senior at another college in Illinois, and I'll be moving to Urbana–Champaign for the summer to serve a kickass internship, which just so happens to be on UIUC's campus. I've been to the university twice before, but I don't (yet) know anyone in the area, or where the social spots on campus (and off campus) are. I'm not the party animal type, but that doesn't mean I don't like to explore new places and talk with new people. As an ambivert (a cross between an introvert and extrovert), I very much do! (At times, hehe.) So whatever wisdom you have to share would be much appreciated! I'm also in search of housing (probably a sublet), but I suppose that's a whole 'nother thread. <eos> \n",

Those of you who have been at PAR or other similar dorms without A/C, how tough is the late summer weather without AC? Are the dorms pretty cool just from isolation/shade, or does it get pretty toasty? Also, any PAR people have any tips/info/etc about living in PAR? Thanks! <eos> \n",

If he is not claimed within 5 days, he will be neutered and put up for adoption.  He is comfortable around people, and he didn't try to bite me when I carried him home from downtown Urbana. If you are looking for a cat, please consider him. Save him from being put up for adoption with a name like \"Bonkers\" or \"Thin Mints.\"  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Walking around the Quad today, I realized we attend such a great university. We have a great Engineering program that is stronger than the engineering programs most Ivy league schools and a Business program that has the strongest Accounting program in the country and is in the top 20 for all undergrad business schools.  But our ranking doesn’t really reflect how great UIUC is. How in the hell are we number 42? Having visited the following schools: University of California-Santa Barbara, UNC and Emory I can not find any reason on why they should be ranked higher than us. I was born and raised in California and I have a hard time figuring out why University of California - Irvine and University of California - Davis are ranked higher than us, especially since we all know there the schools where the USC, Berkeley and Stanford rejects go.  I am not saying we should be in the top 10 or even top 20 but being 42 is bullshit. We should be up in the top 25 with Carnegie Mellon University, Michigan, and University of Virginia.  Do ranking matter? It depends on how you ask, and in the grand scheme of things - no. But our rankings is how we are initially perceived by many people and I think we our was better than 42.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I think I'd have to withdraw this week. In such a case, what happens to my grade? It's past eight-week, but it's still under refund deadline. I don't care about money, but I do care about what happens to grade, though: I am not actually withdrawing because of my grade, but because of mental stress. I feel so pressured, and I am constantly crying, and then laughing for no reason, unable to do much. I also feel that my major is so detached from what I can do good that there is no reason to stay. But I still want to transfer, so I want to think of my grade. I know reddit isn't the best place to ask this, but I hesitate to ask to office because I'd have to use my university email to get replies back. Also, should I go for McKinley mental health withdrawal, in any case? <eos> \n",

I've never dealt with snow outside of vacations, and I interviewed at UIUC in March on a pretty warm day with very little ice. I'm just wondering if I should try to find a pair of snow boots since I figure I should be able to get them pretty dirt cheap down here in Florida. It seemed like the pathways were cleared quite well for walking, but there were some spots where I had to go a bit out of my way to avoid snow. And again, I visited on a warm day (30*F I think) so I don't think my impression is very good. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> One year ago I was in one of the lowest states I’ve ever been. I had a horrible time adjusting to college as a freshman; I let my social anxiety get the best of me, hadn’t made any friends and was extremely lonely and depressed. I made a Reddit account because sometimes browsing the posts on here made me feel a little less alone- I knew I wasn’t the only one going through these issues- and the memes and shitposts put a smile on my face when not much else could. I just want to give encouragement to anyone out there, no matter if you’re a freshman or a fifth-year senior, that you are not alone, and it is okay to seek help. Like so many others, I took the advice of people on this sub and saw a therapist at the Counseling Center for about 10 weeks. It completely turned my life around. She was able to get me an appointment with a psychiatrist at McKinley, and I’m now on medication for depression which has made a world of a difference for me. Growth comes and goes at times, and it hasn’t all been easy, but I’m in such a different place than I was one year ago and I’ve been thinking about that a lot on my cake day today. I just want to thank you all for being such a great community and making my life a little less dark this time last year.  <eos> \n",

Just show your phone to the cashier, no purchase necessary. Even the $8 double quarter pounder is legit. Delete the app  re-register with a different email address, and get another coupon. I've had $0 and no food for the past few weeks, so this  free gmail accounts has kept me going. I'm actually kind of hoping this stops working because I don't need such a sustained shitty diet, but it's better than nothing.  Enjoy! <eos> \n",

When I try to focus in lectures, I find myself zoned-out after a minute or two. I put my phone/laptop away during lectures, and block every social media when I work, but even then, I'm distracted by my mind, and it takes about 3 hours to do what others would take 1 hour.  I did well in high school but being an engineer here on campus, I've been having hard time keeping up with my workload. I feel like I would really need to get help for this, but I'm not sure how. If I don't, I'm sure I'll get on probation or dropped by the end of next semester as my course work will be even harder then.  I would greatly appreciate if anyone could advise me.

Prior to the passage of the new income tax rate, the University of Illinois withheld at the 3.75% rate as required. The new 4.95% withholding rate will be implemented with payrolls paid on or after July 13, 2017. Due to the passage of the increased rate after the July 1, 2017, effective date, you may owe additional income tax next year when you file your 2017 Illinois individual income tax return.  To see how this change affects your state income tax withholding and your net pay, you can use the Monthly Net Pay Calculator and Bi-Weekly Net Pay Calculator found on the Payroll and Benefits web page.

            "<bos> I dropped out of college a few years ago and am interested in going back to school at some point as a math or computer science major. My GPA is not that great (3.2), but I see on their site it says math major transfer students typically have a GPA of 3.2. I gather I couldn't get into the computer science major since it looks like that's very competitive and requires more like a 3.8 GPA -- but do you think there's any chance of me being accepted into UIUC as a math major? I'm an adult student and I don't know if that would make a difference -- if preference would go to more traditional college students. It's also very important to me to go to a less stressful, more laid-back school (I'm not looking for somewhere academically easy, though) so I don't know if UIUC would be a good fit anyway. Also, do they have a lot of adult students or would I stick out? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I believe there is a scam going around targeting out-of-state students here in Illinois, and I want to warn everyone in and around the UIUC area of the scam and to be careful. This morning I received a call from the Rockford FBI office, telling me that I was under investigation for Tax Fraud and tax evasion due to a missing form that was sent to my permanent address. They told me that if I do not comply, I will have to go to court, pay a fine, have all my assets seized, have my university account frozen, and I would be blacklisted from applying for a job in the US, even going as far as to supply a case number and warrant number. They will even confirm very personal information, such as your permanent address, your major, and your graduation date. They then transferred me to an IRS office and I was instructed to purchase $3900 in financial cards or gift cards from the Prospect Avenue Target and transfer over the card number and the eight-digit access number in which they will redeem the gift cards immediately. These should have been the first clues that I was being scammed: The FBI and IRS will NOT contact you through cell phone or e-mail and will only contact you through the postal service. The second clue was the requirement to purchase gift cards or financial cards from Target in order to complete the transaction.  At this point, I was having doubts, but I still went along with what they said. Then, they told me I had to drive to the IRS office in Decatur, or even the office in Rockford, in order to conduct an interview in order to clear my name. Throughout the entire time, the scammers will request to stay on the line with you, as \"the call was being monitored\". In reality, this is to prevent you from calling to outside sources to confirm this \"tax fraud\". In a momentary drop from the call, I was able to contact my parents and my bank and they both confirmed that I may be in the process of being scammed. They tried to contact me again multiple times thereafter to confirm an \"interview\", as well as try to extort about $3600 more, but I had enough and headed back to Champaign to sort out my finances and contact the police.  TL;DR: People claiming to be from the Rockford FBI offices and IRS are scamming people through the phone by telling them that they are under investigation for tax fraud complete with case number and warrant number, and telling people to buy gift cards and exchange them at a weird location. <eos> \n",

If you are already building projects using frameworks like Angular/React, the bulk of the presentation will be a livecoding walkthrough of Vue.js which should give a good impression of its strengths and weaknesses w.r.t. some of the more popular frameworks.  It will be tomorrow (monday, 4/11) in Siebel at 7pm, 3401. The livecoding demo doesn't require you to download anything if you want to follow along.

I'm definitely down to barhop or just dick around campus or whatever ideas anybody has. I joined a bunch of RSOs as well but those are pretty slow to get started and I'm impatient. Also apologies for being lame and using a throwaway for this, lol.  edit: -__- edit 2: YOU GUYS this is awesome and I'm happy to see people actually interested!

            "<bos> Hey guys. I have been reading through the subreddit for the past week and I have become super conscious about my chances of joining the CS program. My transcript is flawless in terms of grades; however, my resume is god awful. I have joined two groups that involve coding but they are more interest groups than actual organizations. I have read that even with A's in all classes, the chances of getting accepted are low. What are my chances of getting accepted? I cannot find any useful information online so it would be nice if transfer students from DGS can provide me insight on their acceptance into CS. Thanks for reading! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So, I'll cut to the chase. I just finished my freshman year at UIUC as an MCB major, and performed pretty rubbish in my core classes (C+'s in CHEM 102/104 and MCB 150), but did just fine in everything else. And I know this is no where near failing, but I feel as though I only performed at this level because I was disinterested in my coursework, not because I was incapable of completing the work, and I am a firm believer that if you lose interest, your grades will suffer quick and the trend will continue, so I don't wanna go down that path. ...Anyway, I just spent the last few weeks exploring options in terms of majors, career paths, things that interest me, etc. but it seems like I'm running low on possibilities. I've been heavily discouraged against trying to switch into Engineering due to its selectivity; Same goes for CS; I realized I can't even switch into Business past freshman year, and those all leave me very, very confused as to what my next step should be. In terms of career paths, I've been interested in accounting, mathematics, economics, etc, but I don't know what the next step would be. (Can't do accounting at U of I, I feel as though econ is a useless major tbh, etc.) At this point, I realize I'm just rambling, but I don't know what to do and my brain can't take it anymore. I'm far too indecisive for my own good. I thought it was normal to switch majors in college, but I feel as though my options are greatly limited and I've dug myself into a hole. Please advise. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am currently a sophomore at ISU hoping to transfer to UIUC this spring. I have 34 earned credits and currently have a 4.0 after my freshman year here at ISU. I sent in my application 3 weeks ago and plan to transfer into communications. I am wondering when I will find out if I am accepted or not. Online, it says I will not find out until November-December but that seems really late considering the application closes October 15th. Does anyone have any experience with this? Obviously, I think I have pretty good odds of being accepted, but I can't be too sure. Thanks for any and all advice <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I started my PhD program in CS last semester. However, that smester was totally boring and isolated. I was not able to find people to socialise and kept inside the room for most of my days.

            "<bos> i am a freshman and i am currently in dgs. i came in expecting to do either chem or mcb, but i had kind of a shitty start with my freshman year (problems adjusting to being in college and stuff like that) and have been kinda depressed/homesick since the year started. my grades are not that good and i am struggling in basically all of my classes. as i said before, i am in dgs and honestly have no idea what to do with my life. i dont know what i want to major in and dont know what i should do. i feel like i am wasting my time, energy, and money here because 1. i have no idea what i want to do and it is stressing me out and 2. i am not happy here. i dont know if i should transfer to a community college around my house (harper) and try to figure stuff out there for a little bit and then try to come back/go to another university, or if i should just stick it out and continue trying here. i dont want the end of my sophomore year to come around and still not know what major i want to declare. i literally stress about it all the time and the fact that so many people on here dont like dgs makes me even more scared for my academic future. i also am worried about what my parents and people at home will think about my decision. i dont know what to do and need some advice.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> For those of you living in apartments this fall, especially first-timers, you'll want to explore your internet options and get ready for the new year. The plans: - ATT U-Verse, $30/month/12Mbps for 12 months. $100 equipment fee, self-install. You keep the modem/router. ATT U-Verse's 1-year deals do have contracts for that 1 year, see section 4a and 5a of the TOS. After that, the price goes up and the contract ends. 250GB/month soft cap (DSL is the one with 150GB). - Comcast/Xfinity has a great $30/month/12Mbps promo just for students for 9 months. Use [url link] to get it. Modem rental = $7/month. $35 installation fee. No contract (not even 9 months). Or, buy a modem anywhere online. See [url link] for compatible routers. A technician still has to come out and install it though. 250GB/month soft cap. - Pavlov: Stay away. I don't know of a single person that is happy with it, and this reflects in the comments below. - Volo: Some apartments have it, seems slow and I've never heard of anyone with it or what they think of the service. - Clear 4G: ~6Mbps. They don't sell it for the Champaign/Urbana market but claim it works there. Check the coverage maps. Keep in mind you can find free Wi-Fi all over campus. There is only a contract when getting a discount on the device. Supposedly no caps. ~$45/month. HOWEVER, a commenter below says there is no signal. Anyone else? <eos> \n",

I know that there was a large thread a month or two back about potential schedules but sadly transfer students get to register very late so I wasn't able to participate. Can anyone give any advice about how manageable this schedule is (totaling 16 credits, max I've ever done is 14) :  Math 444 (Elementary Real Analysis) Math 453 (Number Theory) Stat 400 (Statistics I) CS 173 (Discrete Structures) CS 126 (Software Design Studio)  To clarify I've already taken a college level intro to proofs class so I don't have to take Math 347.

I was wondering if you've had any success stories along with difficulties, obstacles, and whether you've overcome them (or not.)

Instead, I am accepted into Physics . I am fully aware that UIUC have an awesome Physics program. but I just want to do engineering. My dream is to become an engineer one day. So is it likely to be able to transfer to Engineering ? If grades is all that matters I think I will be able to manage it. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your help. Sincerely PS(just to clearfy, it is Physics in LAS. Not engineering Physics) <eos> \n",

I am bringing family down and can't relocate them all for just 2 months, etc.  2nd (and lastly), does anyone have experience on location based job searches?

I live in Urbana on one of the streets mentioned in the email and am now pretty worried. I've walked home(sometimes to schnucks) multiple times before, sometimes even late and have always felt that most places west of vine were pretty reasonably secure. I've thought about it multiple times and have always thought that if something like this were to happen to me I'd just constantly scream because of the really high density of houses all around me but I don't know how smart/not smart doing something like that is. What should I be ideally doing in such a situation? I kinda thought something like this was bound to happen though because I barely see cops patrolling between Lincoln and Race and am wondering why that is so, considering a lot of students + professors live in this region. <eos> \n",

Almost the entire length of the hallway on the east side of the building there is just a continuous wall with two offices on either end, but no doors in between. I am just curious what is behind that wall?! I know there is space there and it is not the edge of the building because my lab would be directly underneath it. My imagination runs wild with what is in there and even how to access it, if anyone knows please let me know!! <eos> \n",

I'm looking to get a single room and I'm worried that by the time I try to reserve mine there won't be any left??? I prioritized all the halls that have singles in them (Busey-Evans, FAR, etc) so I don't know what difference that makes.

            "<bos> Hi all, I thought this was really interesting so I wanted to write a little bit about it. Facilities and Services (FS) provides cooling to more than 90 buildings on campus through a chilled water system. Buildings connected to the system don't have their own cooling system, but rather use air handler units that operate on cold water. This water is cooled down at chillers located across campus, piped to buildings, and then returned. If you go to the basement of Noyes there is a tunnel connecting it to the Chem Annex and Roger Adams Lab. You can see the pipes that bring the chilled water to Noyes there - one that provides water to the building and one that returns it. There are some cool things that can be done with a chilled water system, mostly pertaining to cost-efficiency. In addition to the water chillers, the campus has a thermal energy storage tank. Instead of the chillers piping water directly to the air handler units in buildings, cooled water is stored in a 6.5 million gallon tank near the Oak Street chillers. If you've ever been to the Merry Ann's on Neil St., you can see the tank from Kirby just east of the bridge there. Anyways, water is cooled down during the night, when energy costs are at their lowest. Then chillers can be turned off for most of the day, saving money (versus running the chillers all day). The tank was built in 2010 and saves the University about a million dollars a year! There's also a pretty cool \"energy dashboard\" [here]([url link] that lets you see how much energy is being used at various campus buildings. Fair warning, it is flash and a bit clunky but nonetheless pretty interesting. If anybody has any corrections or additions let me know. *Edit:* FM - FS <eos> \n",

Is there any way to report this douche so some action gets taken against a file of his or anything like that? He could easily have killed a biker in the bike lane passing at 40MPH with no visibility like that, and he was about an inch away from smashing into my car as I was making a turn.

            "<bos> Hey, guys. I'm a Sophomore CS major in ENG, and I want to ask other CS majors about how the life of professional CS industry is like. In more details, I'm a CS major who just finished two most basic CS courses : 125 and 173. I had no previous CS experiences unlike some CS majors who had interests in CS since they were young. So, I am really confused if \"only following the school curriculum\" is fine to be a professional CS person after I graduate. Well, following the school curriculum and getting good enough to graduate doesnt seem to be that difficult, but what I really worry about is that I really don't get how CS companies work and how my learnings in college will help me with it. I have no internship experiences and not really sure what the CS companies are looking for. I don't know what to focus on when I take CS courses.  I'm sorry for making the question too vague, but this is my situation right now; my identity as a CS major is vague.  Let me rephrase my questions: 1. I'm not sure what to focus on when I take CS courses. What will be helpful for me to be a professional CS major in the future? 2. What is a good thing to do other than just following the school curriculum to be fully prepared for working in CS industry? 3. How do CS companies work? Im sure that it will be way different from how school works.  I'm so proud to be a CS major in UIUC, but I really want to utilize this opportunity to be successful in the future. I will appreciate your advice!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Yo, saw those scammers at Campus Center (JSM— 601 S 6th in Champaign). Called the police on them yet again. If someone comes to your door claiming to be with Amaren— figure out their outfits and what they look like and then ask them for their identification. They’ll leave. Don’t give them your electricity bill. Call 911, not non emergency. Have them picked up.  Edit: Y’all blew this out of proportion. This is insane. I was merely posting a heads up considering my next door neighbors didn’t even know this was a scam. It was a courtesy.  As stated in the comments: JSM DID state several times to call police if these scammers are to be soliciting on their property as it IS trespassing and IS illegal no matter the scenario. This is private property.  Why the hell does everyone need an argument around here? Deep breaths, humans. Have a fantastic day.  <eos> \n",

I spent the summer receiving treatment and getting myself back into a daily routine and re-entered in Fall 2015. It seems I wasn't ready though. I ended up in the exact same situation. Depression got the best of me, as did the stress of getting my Financial Aid back after my terrible Spring semester. I got a GPA lower than 1.0 for the semester, and I've been dropped. I need advice on how I should move forward. The part I'm most terrified about is telling my family. I don't know how to tell them that I failed again, especially after they put money into sending me back. And after I tell them, whether they're supportive or not, I don't know how to proceed. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I am thinking about taking this as an ECE Technical Elective, but I am not sure what it would entail.  I do have a strong interest in materials, and thought it would be an interesting class to take, but the course description doesn't tell me much.  Have any of you taken it? Thoughts? Thank you! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My GF found a Cravings Hot and Spicy chicken recipe that taste very close to it. you need: Lee Kum Kee: Chili Chow chili oil or \"old grandma/aunt\": fried chili in oil onions chicken thighs boneless and skinless vegs of choice crushed or dry red peppers eggs veg oil For chicken: 1. cut chicken thighs to size of choice (smaller pieces= faster frying) 2.place 2 eggs in bowl and mix. 3. dip chicken piece in egg bowl then cover with flour in another bowl set aside repeat until all chicken is covered with flour. 4. heat oil in a pot then place chicken to fry until golden brown or chicken is not raw. Hot and Spicy Chicken time: 1. get a pan and place a handful of cut onions, crush or dry red pepper, and 3-4 table spoons(add more for preference or change some to veg oil for it to be less spicy) of the chili oil suggested. 2. let the oil warm up and place vegs and chicken in. 3.mix as it cooks and it is done once the vegs seem sauteed and chicken is warm. will look something like this [url link] if anyone got more recipes please share! <eos> \n",

Any other options out there to shorten a pair of pants and take in some sleeves on a shirt? Any place to get my snazzy shoes cleaned and polished? Thanks reddit. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> On Wednesday or Thursday of last week I misplaced my winter coat and now I cannot find it. It might've been in one of the following buildings: * Mumford Hall * Animal Sciences Laboratory * Electrical and Computer Engineering Building * Altgeld Hall * Allen Residence Hall * Florida Avenue Residence Hall * Pennsylvania Avenue Residence Hall Yes that is a **ton** of buildings that's why I'm freaking out! I've checked the lost and founds for all of those buildings and I have had no luck. Maybe reddit can help me out. I will add some pictures later if I can find some but it is a  **large, dark green winter coat with a pair of blue and red gloves in the pockets** **edit:** It's a men's coat btw <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all, I have about a month to study for proficiency exams. Which is the most doable, or is it feasible to attempt two? I know that MIT OCW has excellent math video lectures (I used the Strang Linear Algebra lectures previously), but don't know how well they'd hold up for Math 285 or if they even have Phys 213. Could I learn Phys 213 from SmartPhysics? For CS 125 I'd just pick up a textbook and work through practice problems/tests. Many people have recommended that I take CS 125 as a class, but I just do not have the time in my schedule and I have no idea how I'd get in at this point. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey all, When I applied for college last year, I put 13 prestigious names on a list and applied to all 13. I told others who looked at the list that I was going to take a gap year if I didn't get into a single one, a very possible outcome as none of the 13 schools I applied to could be counted as 'safety' schools. Was I reckless? Maybe, though I did manage to get accepted into 4 of my 13 applications. One of them offered me an electrical engineering major at U of I. There was very little doubt in my mind before I chose to come here. Once I got to this school, however, I realized how lucky I was. I ended high school with a 3.57 cumulative GPA and my IB scores (basically internationally accepted APs) were mere 5s or 6s out of 7s. Everybody else around me also in electrical engineering had far higher GPAs and had a ton of 5s on their APs. As an Asian-American I still don't understand how a school in a country with affirmative action would let me in. But I'm doing fine right now, despite how much less qualified I was compared to everyone else. My midterms were good and I feel fine with my life. Yes yes, I'm still an EE freshmen, but it's still something to perform well in comparison to others, especially due to my 'lackluster' (as some described it) high school career. Can I guarantee you will get in to U of I ECE? No, but you won't know either unless you make the effort in the first place. Give it a shot if you want and don't let mere numbers bring you down. Just apply if you have doubts and you might find yourself to be in my shoes come next year. Good luck! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'll be a new transfer student in the fall and was looking to go to a restaurant on the move in day with some friends. However, I don't really know which one to go to, but I am leaning toward KoFusion a bit because some have said they have a great sushi menu as well as a pretty nice selection of sake. I'd still like to get everyone's opinion on which restaurant they like the best (doesn't matter what kind of food as long as it's good and not terribly expensive). Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'll be a freshman coming in this fall, and I'm currently in CS in the college of engineering. At first I disregarded CS+X majors since I heard they were in LAS and heard that a CS degree from LAS was not as valuable as a degree from the college of engineering. However, since applying in the fall I've taken a few statistics courses, and really fallen in love with stats to the point where I intended to dual major stats and CS, so I guess I was wondering if it was worthwhile to just do CS+Stats? Is the degree just as good as the dual major? Thanks! Edit: Also, what is the process like for transferring from the one major to the other? Is there some page online that goes over it I'm just missing? <eos> \n",

It's someone's christmas gift so i'd really hate to not get it. I'll give someone like 10$ or the next bogo chipotle coupon I come across. dm me if you can help! update: got it returned to sender, thanks for the offers though. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I’ve heard some people say that switching into a major like CE is near-impossible, but I’ve heard others say that it’s easy to switch if your technical grades are good. I’m already in the College of Engineering (MatSE), I have plenty of technical AP credits already, and my grades are competitive. Do I have a good shot at switching into CE? Or is it pretty much a lost cause? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm in ECE, but I've mostly done hardware. Recently I'm looking to improve my background in CS, and would like to make some friends who are top of their game in this area. I'm a decently smart guy but I've taken very little courses in CS. I'm mostly learning a lot of things on my own now and would like to have someone to discuss things with.  I know a few people in CS but I'm too embarrassed to ask them the basic questions I need to ask. I mean, I can write basic codes in Python, Matlab, R, C++, and I know data structures and some basic algorithms. But if you ask me \"why should you use a virtual environment in Python,\" or \"what is a DLL\", I would have no idea. It also scares me when I try to install a package and get an error and have no idea how to fix it. I've also recently started using Ubuntu so if someone can get me up to speed that'll be nice.   <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I'm taking CHBE 321 next semester and the professor is Charles Sing. There aren't any comments about him online, so I was wondering if anyone knows anything about him. My basic questions are just, is he a good teacher, how difficult does he make the class (HW, Exams, Project, etc), and does he have good support for office hours? Also, does he stay organized? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I learned how to drive but I never got a permanent license in my native country. What's the best way to get a license here now? I've asked the driving schools and they don't rent out cars for driving tests, and I'm not close enough friends with anyone with a car to ask them to lend their car to me for the test.  <eos> \n",

Also I don't know where the lockers or any of the cardio machines are at. When is the best time to go when there are less people? I am assuming early mornings?  Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello! I will begin studying at Illinois in the fall as a transfer student. Very exciting! Anyways, I'm looking for recommendations for on-campus living—preferably dorms. I'd love to hear any thoughts—positive or negative—on my options as a transfer student. Edit: Potentially helpful information: I will be an engineering student. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So my roommate plans for fall 2011 just sorta fell through. I figured I would rather start looking for a redditor roommate, so I know I'm getting good stock. I'm looking for a roommate starting pretty much whenever (I am a guy, but I have no preference about the gender of my roommate). I live in a 2 bedroom apartment about a 5 minute drive from campus in Urbana, with a bus stop just outside(Town and Country apartments). Rent is $355 a month and includes garbage. We've got a couple pools in the complex and...I think we have a workout room as well. It's just me living here now, so moving in july, august, or september is fine. Uh...what else...I'm a grad student, so I don't spend tons of time at the apartment. Pets are fine. That's all I can think of right now. If there are any questions, let me know. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This is my first semester here and 6th of college as a whole. I transferred in with a 3.67 (or 3.54 depending on how you look at it because I retook some community college classes I had taken in high school) to engineering physics with 72 credits of community college classes. Unfortunately I thought I no longer needed meds for depression or adhd. I was very wrong and it was a very dumb idea to start university unmedicated. So right now I might fail all classes except ASTR 100, which I'll earn an A in, but the College of Engineering sees it as 0 credits so my A means nothing on paper. I took it because I had to drop physics 214/213. Anyways, I have failed math 285 (3 hrs). I stopped going a month ago with the permission of my advisor. I am at a C- in my other 2 classes-Physics 225 (2) and UP 185 (3). Either of those could tank. I am looking into a tutor for 225 and trying to get caught up with UP 185 but I am horribly behind, my grade saved by extra credit galore and the lack of entered grades.  So, if I fail either of those or get Ds I am probably under a 1.0. I have been in the consoling office all semester and have an appointment with McKinley psychiatrists on Friday, but it may be too late. Nonetheless I do have a documented history of mental illness and a tangible plan to be successful despite it (psychiatrist, consoler) and I have a strong history of academic success at community college. I have been open with my advisor about my mental struggles.  How fucked am I if I go below 1.0?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys. I just real quickly wanted to voice a few concerns and see how realistic they are. To start I'm a CS+Astro looking to pursue a transfer to ENG if possible. I just signed up for classes today.  I signed up for the following: LAS 101 CS 100 CS 125 Phys 100 ELAC 250 Mus 273 Math 221 For the most part I'm happy. The Japanese Culture class will count towards both Non-Western and Social Science, which combined with my AP and Course reqs will cover all my gen-eds. However there are a few concerns. For one my counselor was very conservative when it come to Math. Despite getting an A in Calc AB and an 87 on the ALEKS, he, told me to take Calc 1 unless my AP test tests me out if it. It's kinda worrying then when all my peers are taking Calc 2 or higher.  Then there's Physics. I had a really bad teacher in High School and that dissuaded me from AP, but still I feel like I'm going to be a semester behind. I could always do Chem, but I may get at least some credit from AP. Also, while physics would count towards both LAS and Eng, Chem would only be counted for Engs Gen Eds Finally, I'm considering springing for CS 196 once it opens to the public, but who knows  To summarize, I'm concerned I may be under loading my freshman year and that will put me behind. I value any input.  Edit: Well I'm stuck with the schedule until my AB credit gets processed. I need the credit to take math 231, and i need to be enrolled in math 231 to take physics 211.  About the physics, someone down below seems to think it was worth it. Though a senior friend of mine in engineering sees it as a wasted class. Kind of leaves me a bit torn about the whole thing I guess my schedule will see big changes on Aug 21st... <eos> \n",

Since I'm not in class, can't join RSO's and I live off campus (near Parkland) it's really tough to meet new people. I'm a cool chick, just in a funk right now.  Any ideas? :) <eos> \n",

I haven't tried any milk teas from Taipei Cafe yet but I will be getting some very soon. For those of you who have tried both Latea's and Taipei Cafe's, whose drinks do you prefer? I also heard that Kungfu Tea was opening on campus as well? Any news on that? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm not sure since I don't know how to go about getting it diagnosed, but I believe I may be suffering from depression, maybe anxiety too, but like I said, I don't know. It's gotten me to a point where I can rarely get myself out of bed most days, let alone to class. The fact of the matter is, that isn't good for my grades, I haven't done well on exams, and I'm afraid my grades this semester may be low enough to get me dropped. I just want to know if there's anyone I can talk to for help, both in preventing myself from getting kicked out of this school, and with my mental health (since I'm not sure I can even afford to do anything about it). I doubt the school will care, and I'm probably just completely screwed, but if there's anything I can do, I need to know immediately. And don't bother telling me it's my fault and I deserve it etc. I know it's my fault for not seeking help sooner, but honestly, I've reached a point where I care so little about life that I felt no reason to bother until it was too late. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I know you guys are getting tired of seeing these kinds of posts, but I really have no other place to vent. Its been more than two months since we got here, and I have honestly not made a single friend. In highschool, I had a small but close group of friends that I usually hung out with. I have always been a person that is socially anxious but I tried my best to put myself out there. I joined RSO's (got a board position on one), went to the ARC to play basketball, and went to a few house parties. Nothing. I feel like a complete failure. I feel depressed every Friday night because my roommate goes out and has fun with his group of friends while I just go to bed early. I have been trying to keep a positive attitude for the most part, but today something happened that kind of made me crack. My parents called me because we hadn't talked in a while, and they asked me what I was planning to do on Halloween since it was coming up. I literally lied to them since I couldn't man up tell them that I had absolutely no plans. I feel like if I keep this up I will lose all motivation to continue my life. Without sounding like some edgy teenager, every waking moment that I am not in class or studying is spent thinking about how fucking alone I am. I apologize for the rambling but I had no one else in my life to ramble this shit to, so I posted it here.  EDIT: Holy shit what an incredible response! Thank you everyone for all the support.

I'm only a freshman in my first semester taking Calc I at another university, and I misunderstood the sophomore level transfer as meaning the Calc I and II must be completed only if coming in as a sophomore. I'm currently showing a strong track of performance in my first semester of college. Is there any way to appeal and explain my circumstances? Also, is there any official faculty I should speak with to assist the process besides the transfer counselors?  <eos> \n",

They're not stepping away for a few minutes or half an hour. They might disappear for a few hours and decide to come study at 11pm at Grainger. If you won't be here, don't need leave yo shit here.

I need to know more or less how may people will show so I can get reservations/discounts, etc.  Also, are there any preferences for dates?

If there are enough people *definitely* going, I'll make a google doc for screennames/averages so I can draw up some balanced teams and get a bracket going. It'll also force awkward redditors to associate with other random awkward redditors; the thought of which is too benignly Machiavellian for me to pass up.

Just wondering if anyone would be interested in forming a ~~plagiarism forum~~ study group for CS173? Of all my CS classes this semester (225, 173) this class seems to be the most formidable as far as difficulty of content goes and may be difficult to just lone wolf it. Actually, I could be wrong about that, but who doesn't enjoy boosting their homework scores while making new friends? I'd also be open to discussing the 225 MP's if anyone is still scouting for a group in that class (you'll need one, or so I hear).  edit: I'm relatively new to Reddit.

I'm thinking about 6PM to start. I live in Rantoul at 1546 Par-which you can google map or PM me and I can give you directions. Comment if you are coming over so I know how much to order pizza wise (also let me know if there are toppings you abhor or require). Hope to have some folks over! *EDIT: I'll be getting the pizza from Papa John's as well as the soda. I have chips, beer and booze also. Lastly, for those on the fence, going to make some bacon that I got from the butcher today! <eos> \n",

Great board patients are people that haven't had their teeth cleaned in 4-5 years, that have reliable transportation and are available on a Tuesday morning (8-11:30), Wednesday afternoon (1-4:30) or Thursday morning (8-11:30) for a screening. The first appointment will be during those times and the actual exam is the weekend of May 5-7th. That weekend your appointment will be 2.5 hours and most likely the afternoon of May 5th but hasn't been finalized yet.  So what's in it for you? Besides getting free whitening after my exam-if you qualify to be my patient I will give you a gift card for fuel for each appointment. The day of my board exam I will pay you $100 **or** give you a Sonicare DiamondClean electric toothbrush ($185 value) **or** a WaterPik water flosser--you choose! If you think you might qualify or know someone who is interested, please call the clinic at **217-351-2221** and ask to be scheduled with **Jennifer (PO #3)** Some other things to note- If you are *only* interested in being my board patient, you will get a full set of x-rays ($100 value) and 1/4 to 1/2 of your mouth cleaned. If you would like your whole mouth cleaned it will take 3-4 appointments. The total cost to you is $10 (which I will reimburse you for **if** you qualify to be my board patient.  Please PM with any questions and pass on to anyone you know who may be interested.  <eos> \n",

Some of my concerns include the daily schedule/commitment, if I wanted to go to Grad School how would that be handled, which branch is best for me, what kind of physical requirements are there, what the typical ROTC guy is like, and what kind of long term commitments would I be making.

I have heard that he is an amazing professor, but not sure how much I will actually learn from the class. Did any of you take the class? Did you feel it was useful or should I look into taking something else instead?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> In many states, it is illegal to stop in the middle of an intersection (with the exception of drivers making a left turn).   If you do not have room to drive forward because there is too much traffic in front of you (and you are not making a left turn), then do not enter the intersection, even if you have a green light. If you are part of a long line of cars that have the right of way, but the line of cars is slowing to a stop, make sure you do not block an intersection with your car when you stop. If there is a car in the oncoming lane that needs to turn left, and you are blocking the intersection, then the entire oncoming lane will come to a stop until you get out of the way. I have personally been in situations where MY lane of traffic was blocked by somebody who was waiting to turn left, while the ONCOMING lane was also blocked by somebody needing to turn left.  I know many of you have not been driving for very long. I see it in the way you drive. Trust me on this one, though. To those who do not understand traffic, it will seem like you are being \"benevolent\" to other drivers by leaving space at intersections. For those who do understand traffic, it's a basic expectation that you violate every time we see you dummies tie up an intersection for an entire light cycle because you get yourself stuck and in the way.  And to conclude, here is a handy video that contains additional advice that will make driving in Champaign more pleasant, if at least some percentage of you learn from it.   [[url link] <eos> \n",

Made me sad and angry that they aren't doing anything illegal. Reminds me of my classmates in my home country, killing things for fun. Seems like something a 5 year old would do.

I'm sick and tired of having traffic directed through St. Joseph because some dumbshit was speeding and caused an accident.  Note: this is more of a vent than anything. I know not everyone is doing it, and some idiots are from out of state. This is for the idiots who live here.  <eos> \n",

Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, is holding a press conference to urge the General Assembly to oppose legislation that would eliminate partial tuition waivers for public Illinois colleges and universities on Wednesday, April 8 at 12:15 p.m. in the Pine Lounge of the Illini Union.  \"Over the past few weeks, I have received countless phone calls, emails and letters from constituents concerned about the future of the Illinois partial tuition waiver program,\" Ammons said. \"These waivers serve many vital functions in our state and community, so it is my hope that our event will help shine some light onto their importance, as well as the lives they impact.\"  The focus of the press conference will be House Bill 403, which currently awaits a full vote on the House floor, and will include testimony from those directly impacted by tuition waivers. Representatives from the Council of Academic Professionals (CAP), SEIU Local 73, Champaign County AFL-CIO Central Labor Council, Graduate Employees Union and AFSCME Council 31 will also be in attendance.  Who: State Rep. Carol Ammons, residents, Council of Academic Professionals (CAP), SEIU Local 73, Champaign County AFL-CIO Central Labor Council, Graduate Employees Union and AFSCME Council 31.

I have a midterm tonight that is worth 35% of my grade. There are no more appointments today at McKinley and frankly I don’t want to make up this midterm, I already studied my ass off I don’t want to forget everything. I feel mentally fine, I could take the test. I just don’t want to be in the middle of it and feel like I’m about to shit my pants, literally. What do I do? I have pepto bismol but idk if it will last a whole two hours and I’ve never taken it so I don’t know how effective it is for me. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> At the end of last semester, I posted [this]([url link] about drop status and the secret \"College Probation\" level based on my probation/near-drop experience last year. I've received tons of PMs about it since then, and I have seen a ton of posts lately about drop status so I wanted to expand on that a little bit based on what I learned from the process. I've seen tons of advice saying that if you're in danger of being dropped, contact your adviser or department and communicate with them what went wrong. This is great advice, but you also need to actually think about why you're contacting them in the first place. If your answer is solely \"because I don't want to get dropped\" then you really need to reshape that into something that reflects on your academic success. That first step may get you out of getting dropped, but it does nothing to help you academically. It's *very* easy to just think \"I'll just do better next semester\" and then fall into the same patterns.  When I was first put on probation, I did the bare minimum to meet the requirements because my goal was to get off probation, but I didn't actually link that back to my academics. I ended up failing that probation, and was lucky enough to be placed on college probation. But I had to significantly reshape my thoughts and efforts at that point, because even though I had convinced my adviser that I could improve I didn't really believe it myself. The staff here really don't like dropping students. But they also know that there are students who just cannot and will not be successful if they continue on their current track, and I was definitely on a track that would not lead to success. Sorry for the long post. The tldr is that it's incredibly important to assess why you're in danger of being dropped and take that beyond an excuse to give to your adviser. Lots of people are already doing this and making plans to improve, and that's awesome -- I'm definitely not trying to call anybody out, I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps somebody.  Good luck! <eos> \n",

However, I feel as though taking it will teach me more in depth than the data structure class I took at my previous college, and I don't want to be unprepared for the next CS course (I think it's 233?)... so I guess my question is, is the knowledge gained from 225 worth the time commitment and challenging material?

I just noticed a few hours later that I got a \"You have made too many attempts to register this term. Contact your registrar for assistance.\" message. What does this mean? Am I screwed...? Who is my registrar? What is a registrar? edit: I don't think I did anything that could overwhelm the system, I set it to refresh only every 20 seconds. I refreshed a lot more often by hand while trying to get into CS 374. edit2: spoke to an advisor in Engineering Hall and explained everything, she was sympathetic and my requests were overridden after speaking with CS advising. Also, she said the limit of requests is ~2500, use that how you will. <eos> \n",

My vehicle didn't have any markings indicating that it's a delivery vehicle because my company for whatever reason took forever to order car magnets and I hadn't been able to get any yet. But anyway - I got ticketed for not parking in a metered space.

Chen Si, Undergraduate of Class 2015 from College of Automation also a Navy student \\(similar to ROTC\\) says we should be determined to catch up with European countries and the United States;; Jin Yuan, Undergraduate of Class 2014 from College of Automation says college students should take more responsiblity... Students then watched another documentary... During this exchange program, students had to take courses in English. **In order to manage students and make sure of their thoughts, the two colleges \\(of Automation and of Telecommunication\\) sent four teachers, and established this temporary Party Branch at UIUC.** In addition to this meeting, they had another gathering on July 17, where they watched another documentary. \\&lt;/body\\ <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am going to be a junior EE this fall. I already have credit for ECE 220 and I enroll in CS 225 for next semester. However, I didn't get to register for CS 173, as they were no seats. I heard someone said that as an EE, you don't necessarily need the credit for 225. If this is true, then I will be so relieved.  Just to be clear, I don't plan to take CS/ECE 374 and never intend to do algorithm stuff. The reason I want to take CS 225 is purely to learn C++ and give myself a redemption on programming.  Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm just wondering how it is. I made an absurdly late change to my academic path so by the time I graduate I'll have been here 6.5 years. Therefore, I'm looking for a change of scenery and want to move downtown next year.  I'm Engineering so most of my classes will be on the north side of campus. Is it a big hassle going to and from class? How long are the bus rides? Are they frequent? Should I just plan on staying on campus all day during the week? Do you prefer living downtown? I've had my fill of Kams, Joes, Bros, etc so I wouldn't really mind being far from campus nightlife. Were you able to make new friends while living downtown? Any tips on good places to live?  <eos> \n",

My only obligations are short shifts at my graduate student position at the Medical Library, which is super slow right now. I know I'm gonna be meeting tons of people and staying busy once my program's orientation starts this Sunday. Any recommendations for things to see/do while I've got time, between now and next Tuesday? It'd be nice to explore town a little bit while I've got some down time!!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello Illinis, i am going to spend the next academic year at UIUC for a Mech Eng exchange program. I hope that i'm posting in the correct section. I really need some advice on where to stay; i have been looking into the options and here's what i think i got: -Undergrad halls seem to be the best for social life, however they are expensive as fuck and i'm not sure i can go back to living in a double. -The two grad halls are a little cheaper, but they have bad reviews (ppl seem to complain about rooms size and lack of sociability) -The apartments seem to be the cheapest option, while offering the most space as well as a kitchen (being able to cook for myself would be a pro to me) What do you think are the pros and cons of the three options? Bear in mind that i am 22, but i haven't excluded the undergrad halls yet because i will be coming completely alone so either i make a lot of new friends or i will be alone. Also, my choices are restricted to those halls that allow for staying during breaks (Daniels, Sherman, FAR, PAR, ISR, Ike South)  <eos> \n",

I know one or two local athletes who have used Mettler but I was curious if any other U of I students have used/heard anything about these programs before I went to go see them in person.

            "<bos> According to [the online catalog]([url link] there are currently 25 online master's degrees available from UIUC. They include subjects from computer science, engineering, education, to library science. The new online iMBA thing would probably fall under this too. So what's everyone's thoughts on these? Do these online master's degrees have any value to employers? Will they be taken seriously? Are they simply a way for the university to make money while providing little value to degree holders? UIUC administration/faculty/employer input would be especially appreciated! There's also the [\"professional science masters\"]([url link] thing... any idea if these are taken seriously? <eos> \n",

Most of the film's shooting is done and now we are about to move into the post-production process (hopefully to be completed by the end of summer).

            "<bos> Dear IGB faculty, staff, and students,  As many of you know, there was an incident in one of the labs in the IGB research building on Monday evening. I wanted to take this opportunity to relate the details so we all have a clear understanding of what actually took place. Last evening, one of our researchers opened a supply cabinet containing flammable solvents, at which point a shelf bracket failed and several bottles fell and broke open, resulting in spilled chemicals. The person in question received very minor injuries, but did not need medical care. At no time was there any evidence of negligence, all safety precautions were followed at all times, and at no point was there serious danger. The chemicals were stored in an approved 3-year-old solvent cabinet, rated for far longer than 3 years.  Our safety officer and staff immediately appeared at the scene and took the appropriate steps to contain the situation. I want to thank Bob Mann, IGB Occupational Safety Coordinator, Darci Edmonson, IGB Facilities Manager, and Courtney Evans, MMG Laboratory Supervisor, for their expert handling of this incident and their dedication to the safety of our institute. I’d also like to thank Jim Marriott from Division of Research Safety, and the members of the police and fire departments for their assistance. Although this was a relatively minor incident, I appreciate the concern and efficient management that all parties displayed in quickly resolving it.  For the immediate future, the lab on the south end of the 3rd floor will be closed while final cleanup is completed. We expect completion by the end of today. The offices outside of the 3S lab are fully open, as is the rest of the IGB, and it is safe to enter the building to work. Best, Gene ---- Gene E.

I'm worried about picking ones that seem interesting on paper, and then turn out to be those legendary work-you-to-death courses once you're actually in the classroom. At the moment I'm looking at 440(into to AI), 418(interactive graphics), 465(UI design) and 466(Bioinformatics), but I'm interested if there are ones I've overlooked.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone, I am a soph. transfer student from UCLA. Most of my relationships (or short term hook ups) at UCLA started from POF, OKCupid and of course Tinder. At UIUC I am not having the best of luck with these online dating/hooking up platforms so I have a couple questions:  1. Do a lot of people on campus hook up with through these platforms? i.e. In your friends group/house/RSO do a lot of people talk abouthooking up though via POF, OKCupid, Tinder?  2. If you use these platforms, are you experiencing a large amount of bots?  3. I've met some girls in my RSO but I plan on being heavily involved in the RSO for the next couple of years and I don't want things to get messy since I am not looking for anything serious, so where else should I find people to date? I tried bars but I don't want all of my hook ups to happen 3am when I am blacked out.  4. Any general advice?  <eos> \n",

Fuck, I'm just a high_scienceguy who has been studying molecular and cell biology for the last couple of years. I decided to take CS 101 after becoming super interested in bioinformatics, and I have really enjoyed learning some basic programming in C and Matlab. I would love to get some more programming experience, but I am not sure where to go from here. I really would like to take another CS class next semester that offers hands on experience with programming and software; preferably some that I can apply to work in bioinformatics. Can anyone give me some advice, or suggest some classes that might be worth my time? I'm just looking for classes, CS or not, that would be most applicable to the field of bioinformatics. <eos> \n",

She said that until then, there will be a hold on my account, and that I will be unable to register until I make this meeting. So what are we supposed to talk about? I know what classes I need to take for my major/grad school interests. I know all the steps to fulfill my academic goals, which is why I've never needed to meet with an adviser before. I just have no idea what I'm supposed to ask in this required meeting. Can anyone give some input? Thanks <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I applied for and was offered an internship for this summer on campus (it is run through one of the colleges here on campus). It is the first year they are doing it here and it since has been very unstructured. In preparation, the internship letter said there have been many meetings scheduled to prepare me for the internship. I have sent out emails about these meetings and have either been told I will receive emails later in the week (which was the week before spring break) or have gotten no response. At this point, I have absolutely no idea how this summer is going to work out and have been given zero guidance. I’m very frustrated.  Today I received an email about an internship offer for this summer that is more suitable for my interests and future career plans. It seems to be more structured too. My gut says that this is a better plan for me.  If, hypothetically, I am accepted for the new internship, how bad would it be to go back on my original offer? Should I just stick it out and hope for the best? I’m a junior so I really won’t be able to take either internship again as I won’t be a student next summer.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Long story short, I'm on academic probation, and I probably won't be getting off it this semester. I'm a junior, and still have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life.  I want to drop out now because I'm currently locked in on a lease until August, and could really use the extra free time so I could pick up another job to pay for rent. The only thing is, if I drop out now with shitty grades, will it affect my chances of being reinstated to the university in a semester or two if I somehow figured my life out? Would I even be able to get into a community college like Parkland with a cumulative college GPA floating around a 2.0?  Also, I'm not really on the greatest terms with my parents, so I'm paying for everything myself here.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I never thought I'd come to a point in my life where I'm constantly stressed doing what I used to love doing. To people who are thinking of doing grad school, don't fucking to do it. If you want to get a master's and get the fuck out of here, then do it. If you're thinking of doing a PhD, my sincere advice is to not do it. I hate having to be on my knees every fucking semester doing slave labor for my fucking advisor. Constantly churning out papers for next to nothing barely getting by everyday. I don't have my friends close by anymore. The last relationship I had was a year ago and thanks again to grad school that ended too. I have no one I'm comfortable talking to. I want to cry my balls out talking to someone but I can't. My gf was the only one who used to listen to all my shit and i don't have that. All I have is alcohol to numb my pain and stress. I want to get out of here right now.  I'm not sure why I'm writing this here other than the fact that I can. Don't worry I'm not going to kill myself. I just feel like this a void I can pour out all the shit I am stressed about. Why can't men have the same support system a girl has? And yes I've been to the counselling center, they have no clue how to deal with people, at least in my case. This world is fucked. Anyway I hope all of you do well on your finals and don't have to go through the nightmare that is grad school.  /rant Edit: I did not expect this to take off. Thank you for all your support. I feel a lot better now. After a long shower, some soul searching and a little bit of alcohol, I have some plans in place. To all the people who were kind enough to listen to me, Thank you! I wish I would have met you guys before I made this post. I just feel vulnerable responding because I don't want the first thing people know of me to be that I was in a low point in life. If it comes down to it down the line, I will definitely PM you. I'm trying to respond to all the comments, I apologize for leaving a few out. <eos> \n",

As someone who recently had a pet be put down, I would love to help someone get their's back if at all possible.

Last seen in Parkland Ridge neighborhood (Champaign), near Clayton and Irvine. No collar. Big, friendly, older black lab. This is an older picture of him.

The reason why I didn't sign up for CS 125 right when I could at the end of last year was because I planned to take an equivalent course over the summer, but I got an internship out of town and couldn't. Do I have a good chance of getting into the class assuming I sign up right when it opens? I don't really know how this process works. Any help would be appreciated.  <eos> \n",

We are old, so we probably won't need suggestions on places to hit after the show. :) Thank you in advance for any helpful suggestions! <eos> \n",

If it's because of liability of being stolen, most places have a \"We're not responsible for lost/stolen goods.\" I searched this subreddit but couldn't find an answer, figured I'd simply ask out of curiosity. What do you guys think, should this be changed? <eos> \n",

Nothing has changed since I was online earlier this morning, and I can use UIUCNet without issue. As a precaution, I reinstalled the profiles as well. Also, the CITES status page shows the building I've been using as OK. My operating systems are iOS 7.0.4 and OS X 10.9.1. Has anyone else had this problem tonight? <eos> \n",

So we've saddled up and pretended to be a Comedy Cowboy for this post to answer your three main questions 1) Where can I see comedy? 2) How do I do comedy? 3) I know you're doing a cowboy shtik but the gun is a bit too far.  *Puts gun back in holster* well lemme tell ya about it partner, we've got our big (free) showcase show with comedians from Chicago, St. Louis, and nationwide traveling acts all the time, as well as our handpicked favorites from local area performers. The showcase is every Wednesday night at 8pm downtown at Soma Ultralounge.  But hey random CU Comedy representative feller, what if I think I'm funny as fuck and I've got jokes? Well come check out our open mic every Thursday at 9pm at The Clark Bar in downtown Champaign, no cover of course. If you want to sign up, email Jesse@cucomedy.com. I dare ya. Also, CUComedy.com is pretty good for more info... don't you hate it when people capitalize URLs though? like it's gonna be cucomedy.com in Chrome don't flatter yourself. <eos> \n",

Wondering if I can get the $2,500 tuition differential refunded for the Spring 2014 semester since I took no classes only Chem-Life Sciences majors can take without paying a fee. I emailed the LAS office but the only thing they tell me is the refund cannot be \"justified\" which to me sounds like getting a refund is still possible.  Any advice? <eos> \n",

While it would be entertaining to see one of them tumble into some shrubs, I don't want to get hit by 150lbs+ of rubber, metal, and human. Is texting and biking illegal? <eos> \n",

Please stop. If you want to talk raise your hand. If you don't get called is because the teacher just wants to get thru the lecture. Apparently, he also doesn't keep the door open for other people. That's just mean. <eos> \n",

Which place offers the best price in Chambana without compromising too much on quality of the meat and the produce? Which place has gourmet stuff(nice cheese, wine etc)? Any good butchers that have unusual/cheap cuts of meat(more than your typical steaks and ribs)? 2. Electronics: Need the best price I can get on a laptop and headphones. 3. Shoes: Not too sure about Amazon and returning stuff until it fits. 4. Winter clothing: Need the best possible price on a coat, some winter boots(if they are necessary-don't know anything about this kinda climate), socks, and undergarments for the coldest months of the winter(especially for men). 5. Bike and locks: I've heard a lot about bike thefts over there, so I want something dirt cheap, and probably 2-3 locks to secure the main frame and the wheels. 6. Booze: The cheaper the better. I'm interested only in wine, bourbon, and scotch. 7. Household items: crockery, cutlery, kitchen appliances etc. 8. Generic clothing: Especially for men. This looks like a lot but I'm planning in advance and trying to figure out the lay of the land for the next few years. Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Warning: This post is long. I just went shopping at Meijer. I was in the parking lot ready to go home, when I was approached by a man in his 30s or 40s. He asked me if I could give him a ride. I was hesitant at first, but he told me his destination was a mile away. He was very persistent, so I eventually agreed to give him a ride. Once we got going, he started talking about how his house caught fire, and he was homeless, and started asking me if I could get him a hotel room for the night. At this point, the red flags started going off in my head. I gave him the whole \"I'm a freshman and have no money, my parents still pay for everything\" spiel, but he still insisted I give him whatever money I had. I even offered him a few coupons, which he hastily declined. At this point, I asked him how close we were and he told me we were almost there. At the next red light, I covertly emptied the contents of my wallet into my jacket pocket. I pulled over where he told me to and begged me one last time for money. I showed him my empty wallet and told him I just spent my budget on groceries. He curses at me, slams the door, and that's the last I see of him. Do I need to be worried? I checked my car and I don't think he stole anything. (there's not much in my car to begin with) This whole situation just made me a bit uncomfortable and I felt that I needed to reach out to someone more knowledgeable than myself. Thanks all in advance. Edit: Thank you all for your advice. This is definitely something that won't happen twice.  <eos> \n",

The friend who is subletting out to me now forgot their lease ended before my internship does. Is there anyone willing to put me up until then? I can compensate you and I don't need a bed, I can sleep on the floor. A shower, access to a kitchen and wifi would be the base needs here.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Due to confusion over my grade and a pretty poor effort on the final, I ended up with a D in Calc III. I'm a civil engineering major with a 3.36 gpa. Retaking the class would most likely only boost me up to a 3.4. Since this was kind of a flukey situation, I'm not worried about my gpa moving forward. What I am worried about is a D on my transcripts, especially since it's a math course and I'm CEE. Will this impact internships at all or do they just care about overall gpa? how about grad school? <eos> \n",

I'm moving into an apartment on 3rd and chalmers, and they don't allow direct tv-which I had in my previous apartment. I'm looking for a good company to go through where I can get a decent amount of channels along with good internet speed.  The landlord suggests xpedia, after trying to look information up on them on here, and google, they seem to be a damn travel company so i'm confused on that?  Can someone please help me out with a good service where I would be able to get a decent amount of channels along with good internet speed?  Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

Has anyone heard for certain about a curve? And are we just never getting our multiple choice Scantrons back?

I was just curious to know if there was anyone with past experience transferring here. What's it like? Is there anything I should be ready for before I go? Are there any \"must do's\" around campus that I should know about? I'm coming from a community college, so I have no idea what university life is like. <eos> \n",

No one has given preferences, but I'm going to say let's make accessible for everyone and do the picnic tables over looking Boneyard on the Engineering quad. Hello dearest friends, Given the beautiful weather and the beautiful time we had on Global Meetup Day, I'm setting up a potluck for next Monday! What could be better than copious amounts of food? Thanks to our lovely mod NegatedVoid (eldigg, are you even out there?), we'll have some of the goodies that we won in the College Competition (see: stickers, candy, and our rad banner!). AKA: if you want to see some of the goods we won, I'm going to force you to socialize with us lovely folk. On my end, I'm moving on to greener pastures, so I'll be cooking up a storm. There will be cake. And maybe deviled eggs, and possibly even cayenne candied bacon. As of right now, the plan is for 5:30pm, Monday, July 16, location TBA depending on how many people respond/how hot it is/booze.  Potlucks are all about sharing the love, so in exchange for swag, food, and lovely company, please bring something to share. For those who can't cook/are poor: sweet corn, pasta salad, a bag or two of chips and salsa, some 2 liters, popcorn, cups/utensils/napkins/plates, frisbees. Better yet, bring that dish you cook for the ladies you're trying to impress on the first date, and watch your self esteem soar. Some people also mentioned doing some N64 later? Maybe we could combo it up once we're all stuffed :) <eos> \n",

I'm trying to gauge what kind of interest there would be in a group like that. I would provide yarn and snacks. If you're interested, leave a comment/DM me please!

            "<bos> Hey guys/gals, just have a question about those who have or are in the process of doing research. What is the process like? I assume you email a professor you'd like to work with, and have an interest on the topic that they're researching, but in during the actual research what do you end up doing? Do you make any real finds? I'm kind of intimidated by how much a professor might expect from me or if he might test my knowledge during our time together (not particularly a fan of that) but I'm of course only an undergrad so I'm obviously not finding the cure to cancer. If anyone would care to share their experiences, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Long story short, one of my professors pre-writes all the notes for the class on a paper and projects it onto the screen during class. The only problem is that his handwriting is pretty horrible and he moves pretty fast through the notes so while I'm trying to guess what a word is he has already moved to another section and I end up with half finished sentences in my notes. I've had professors with bad handwriting before and I usually just suck it up and go with it but this is especially bad and I feel like it will definitely impact my studies. Is it acceptable to ask him to rewrite his notes in a more legible handwriting? I feel like it is unfair to the students to burden them with another challenge that isn't part of the coursework. I asked the people sitting by me if they could read the notes and they had the same issue. Has anyone had a similar problem?  <eos> \n",

I get that you're nervous incoming freshmen/transfer students, but almost all these questions can be easily answered by either reading the stuff on the sidebar or looking at some recent posts. I don't think we need multiple posts asking about which dorm is better for which activity. <eos> \n",

We will be fighting other schools / clubs and it would be cool to get some followers and spread the awareness of the club.

The final bill came out to $2503, and since I wasn't a full time summer student I couldn't get financial aid. I don't know exactly how much that one course would have cost me at Parkland, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been over $2000. Not to mention as a student of the engineering college I had the distinct privilege of paying extra tuition. I'm posting this to bitch as well as to warn those considering summer classes at the U of I. Don't do it unless you are taking a lot of classes or you cannot take the classes anywhere else.  <eos> \n",

Since Espresso and Starbucks are by far the most popular in terms of number of locations, which do you prefer and why? Or do you like both or neither? Are there any non-chain coffee shop gems you know of on or near campus? Do you even buy coffee or just brew your own?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi everyone, I have heard quite a number of disparaging remarks about Mahomet, mostly regarding being the rich town and implications of racism. I grew up in Chicago, graduated from the UofI, then my wife and I moved to Mahomet from Savoy after hanging around C-U for a few years after graduation. So I knew nothing about how the various towns viewed each other. We moved there due mainly to the ratings of the school system and we were able to get a bigger house and yard for a smaller cost than in the immediate C-U area. I really never noticed any of these grievances toward Mahomet until I started living there so I would actually catch them. I was curious what the basis for these were and how commonly these insults are thrown around. What's the deal? I'm hispanic, and my wife and I are by no means \"wealthy,\" we're just 2 young adults getting a start in life. <eos> \n",

I've tried to get involved, but since Quad Day it's hard to find what clubs are currently active and how to join. Furthermore, everyone else seems to already have their own little groups fleshed out.

We want to sit together at the campus-wide ceremony, but she received an email that said all Bronze Tablet people should arrive to commencement early. She couldn't remember why the email said to arrive early, but we speculated that Bronze Tablet recipients may have special seating at the front of the commencement ceremony. I was just wondering if there is special seating for Bronze Tablet students, whether or not these students get recognized at the campus-wide commencement, and whether or not she is required to stay at the Bronze Tablet seating. Any current Bronze Tablet students, or general alumni input would be appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Mahesh Viswanathan and I are looking for course assistants for CS/ECE 374. I've provided more information about the position below, but please feel free to ask more questions either here or by email. If you're interested, please fill out the application form at [url link] . If you know people who might be interested and/or who would be great CAs, please forward the link to them.  Thanks! ---- Jeff and Mahesh are teaching completely independent sections of 374, with separate schedules, homeworks, exams, and TAs. CAs will be assigned to one section or the other based on schedule availability for labs, and to evenly split more experienced CAs between the two sections. We anticipate hiring a total of 24 CAs, 12 in each section. **Duties:** Course aides in 374 have the following required duties: * Grading homework: typically one problem every other week, shared with one other CA, under the guidance of a graduate TA. This is both the most important and the most time-consuming part of the job. * Attending at least one twice-weekly lab section to help guide students, with a graduate TA. * Regularly monitoring the course Slack channel In addition, CAs can take on optional tasks such as the following: * Answering questions on Piazza * Running office hours/tutoring/review sessions * Attending weekly course staff meetings * Writing notes or developing other course resources **Compensation:** Per department policy, first-time CAs are paid $14/hour, and CAs with prior experience are paid $15/hour, up to a maximum of 8 hours per week. (Paid hours include optional activities like Piazza, staff meetings, and office hours.) **Requirements:** CAs must have credit for 374 or a later course in theoretical computer science (473, 475, 574, 583, 598, etc.) with a grade of A- or better. (An A+ grade is not necessarily an advantage; an ideal CA has a B+ or worse in 374 but an A or A+ in some later theory course.) CAs should also have strong communication skills, especially with students who find the material difficult. CAs should be interested not only in the course material, but also in the practice of teaching it. Finally, CAs are expected to treat all students (and course staff) with honesty and respect, regardless of gender, race, national origin, major, or facility with the course material.  CAs are typically undergraduates, but we will also consider qualified graduate students. International students must complete an I-9 form before beginning any work for the University. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Does anyone have any recommendations on courses which are scientific (physics, math, CS, engineering etc) for next semester? I have essentially a physics background, but i don't mind venturing into the other subjects- something that's level 300-400 preferably, and maybe easier to get a good mark compared to other modules (if that's possible) <eos> \n",

            "<bos> On the student legal services site it says they are closed for winter break. Do they reopen on the 20th? I was involved in an auto accident and require counsel. I wanted to settle without the involvement of their insurance company but she says she wants to see doctor for stiffness after the accident.  If they are closed for another week I will be forced to find an outside group. On that note, if you've had to deal with this type of issue before could you give advice on how I should proceed and what attorney I should contact? I was uninsured at the time and my insurance company says that they cannot help with this accident.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Being in college for the first time is exciting and I'm sure a lot of you are excited to be surrounded by all these people your age who are excited to take part in the hook up culture. With that said: If you are with a drunk person, and they are slurring their words, are stumbling/clumsy or seem unusually \"lit\", please just make sure they get home safe and do not do anything with them. They might throw themselves at you and try and sleep with you, and while maybe you might be excited at the prospect of your first sexual encounter, do not reciprocate anything if they look/act genuinely drunk.  I don't care how ridiculous this post may seem to some here, this is a huge sub and if I can prevent one incident from happening, its worth it to me. In my honest opinion, when I see the insane amount of people from the bars who get shit faced drunk and then have sex, it tells me consent is something not many people on this campus understand. You would be surprised how many people I know who have told me \"I was so drunk I don't even remember sleeping with her/him\"  Be careful handling your alcohol and stick to the hook ups when both of you haven't had that much to drink. Have fun y'all. EDIT: Just for people who might scoff at this, going to US prison as a sex offender is terrifyingly gruesome to say the least. Consent and proof of consent is very hazy and I would rather have good people who are just excited to lose their virginity to play it safe. I wish for all of you to get your degrees, fall in love and have families someday.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> The weather is great and its nice to take your bikes out now but make sure you lock your bike tires to something.  Earlier today on the engineering quad there was an older white man with long white hair and an orange backpack poking around a lone bicycle at the bike rack. It looked like the bike wasn't his and while it was locked up it looked like he was about to steal the tires off of it. I tried to approach him as politely as possible but he was immediately aggressive and when I told him I wasn't leaving until the he unlocked the bike or left it alone he left and I called the police. So if you see a man matching the what i described around a bike rack keep an eye on him and be careful with your bikes.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello out there - today we heard from a client who had updated their Mac to High Sierra, and now FastX won't connect via their desktop client. The vendor of FastX - Starnet - is aware of this issue, and they're working on a solution. If you haven't yet updated to High Sierra and you depend on the FastX desktop client to connect remotely to use EWS software packages, you might want to hold off on the High Sierra upgrade for now. If that ship has already sailed, you should be able to use the browser-based client in the interim until Starnet can update the desktop version of FastX. Info on connecting to FastX can be found [here]([url link] Have a good rest of the weekend. -EngrIT Outreach <eos> \n",
            "<bos> A campus-wide task group is evaluating the tools and services used for teaching and learning online at UIUC, specifically learning management systems like Compass 2G, Learn@Illinois, and others. We're gathering statistics, surveys and focus group feedback on what teachers and students use, what works, what doesn't, what they'd like to have instead, fixed, etc. This valuable feedback will help guide future LMS options for campus. 1-hour focus groups (small number of participants, informal discussions, speak from your experiences, we listen and take notes) are setup in the next few weeks. Student sessions: * Monday Feb 1, noon-1, BIF * Tuesday Feb 2, 4-5pm, Education * Wednesday Feb 3, 4-5pm, Armory [Student focus group signup]([url link] (It occurs to me typing that up that we didn't schedule a student focus group somewhere north of Green-- if you'd be up for that, ask in the comments.)

            "<bos> It is 1:00 in the morning as I write this and Trump needs just 5 more electoral votes to win the election. There is no longer any mathematical possibility that Hillary will win. I think it's time we face the truth.  It's been a roller coaster ride of an election season. The Trump victory will come as a shock and disappointment to many, as it does to me, but I just want to remind everyone that life will go on. No president nor government can change who we are and what we believe in. And no president can define this country. The American democratic system has several power checks in place; now we just need to have faith in the system that's kept this nation afloat since its inception. We must have faith in our ability to move on. We must have faith that America will be fine.  Champaign-Urbana is known for its strong voter turnout, and as a first-time voter, I am proud to have been part of it this year. If there's one thing to learn from this election, it's that your vote counts.  Especially if you live in Florida. Fucking Florida.  Peace out, fam. Good luck, America. <eos> \n",

I intended to sign up for housing as soon as it opened, but I had a lab and a discussion section during the time slot and now that I'm finally done, I log in to find that nearly all the residences I had interest in (Bousfield, Nugent, Daniels, Sherman) were completely unavailable. My question is, how likely is it that a room will become available in any of the said residences? And how should I proceed with the situation? I'm not enticed by the idea of having to constantly check for available rooms, or is that the only solution? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I know this is going to get downvotes, but I really don't get it. Yes, it's true. Every time I'm walking down Green street and have to walk on the grass, it's because it's a group of 5 Asian students walking shoulder to shoulder. Every time there are students talking loudly in class, it's a group of Asians. Every time there are students obviously cheating, it's a group of Asians. So if this is what their culture is like, how is it racist? I understand that it's racist to say \"Oh, there was a burglary? It was probably an African American.\" But if you aren't speculating and just pointing out a pattern, how is it racist? <eos> \n",

I've taken advantage of most of the AP Classes in my high school.  My senior year I took: AP calc bc, ap bio, ap lang and composition, ap psych, ap physics B.  My Junior year I took: ap chem, ap gov, ap stats. Thanks and i'm really looking forward to meeting some of you next year! :) <eos> \n",

Reading the text, limited office hours, and khan academy do not seem to be enough for me. I am not usually the best at math courses, not since the easier calculus classes. Would anyone be willing to tutor me on a couple topics; I am willing to pay. Current topics for exam II: * Linear independence, basis, dimensions * Four fundamental subspaces * Linear transformations * Orthogonal vectors and subspaces * Projections onto vectors * Projections onto subspaces and least squares approximations  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I need to get a suit stitched, but I don't know where to go? Anyone know where? Preferably somewhere on campus because I don't have a car. Brand isn't important but I do need a good quality suit. I have no idea what goes into a good quality suit though so a place where they can help me figure it out would be good too. So, in summary: Need to get a high quality suit stitched, preferably close or on campus, need shop people to tell me what goes in a good quality suit. Price isn't an issue as long as it isn't going to bankrupt me. EDIT: So I guess stitching doesn't mean what I think I mean. I meant getting a custom suit made. EDIT2: Alright thanks for your help everyone. While I can spend what I consider a substantial amount, I don't know if I can spend as much as it seems like a custom made suit will cost. Also whats with the downvotes? I'm sorry I don't know things and ask :| <eos> \n",

She said that U of I won and that the concert would be some time this semester, but I have not heard anything about it. I googled it and could not find anything about. Does anyone know anything about this or where I can find out something? Does this even exist? **EDIT** So I kept looking and I have found some more information. Apparently it is called the Collegiate Showdown and last year West Virginia won. I have found some posts about the WVU party but still nothing about U of I. [Here]([url link] is a link to the only article I can find that slightly references this year's party but it does not say who won. <eos> \n",

Will Edit again when people comment that this will work for them (or suggest a better time/place) EDIT2: Espresso Royale near Canopy tonight at 7PM! I'll also bring chess and fluxx in case the number of attendees doesn't make a full euchre game. I'm the guy with the green messenger bag.

            "<bos> Although my living experience leasing under Next Chapter Properties was pleasant, I would strongly recommend staying away from the company. Upon vacating the property at the end of the lease, they illegally charged me a considerable number of move-out fees. These include fees for paint touchups, carpet vacuuming, and general cleaning. This is illegal under Urbana city law section 12.5-20d. They also failed to provide me with the itemized, paid receipts which is illegal under Urbana city law section 12.5-20a.  After speaking with the management about the illegal and unethical charges, it’s clear that I was not the only one given these bogus charges. The property manager told me that “99% of our tenants go above normal wear and tear.” This shows a pattern of gross incompetence and negligence in their duties as a landlord. The landlord must provide a burden of proof showing verifiable damages that would otherwise interfere with use of the living space. Otherwise, these are simply fanciful claims that do not meet any sort of legal definition. I went back into the unit to inspect the work they did and it turns out they never actually painted the walls or cleaned the carpets as they claimed. The documents they did provide me show that they hire contractors to do cleaning and painting over the entire building and then split up the charges to each room. This is yet again illegal since the charges and bills must be itemized and specific to each unit. If you lease from them, it’s likely that they will hit you with these same fraudulent charges as well. I am aware of many others that they targeted as well. While the buildings themselves are nice and have plenty of amenities, it wasn’t worth it in the end. If you don’t mind being charged illegally, having your entire security deposit withheld, and spending months fighting them to return the money they legally owe you, then you may enjoy living there though. Otherwise, it’s in your best interest to look somewhere else.  <eos> \n",

People closing their doors in the hallway, and people closing/opening doors to the dorm building outside, even with my windows closed, keep me up at night. That's not even including how obnoxious most people are in dorms. I was thinking about sleeping in a classroom to escape the noise for a night to, since I have a big test tomorrow. How good of an idea is this, and are there any better ones? (Sleep aids have not helped) Edit: Thanks everyone. I just bought melatonin, hopefully it works for me. If it doesn't help I'm definitely just going to find an empty classroom tomorrow night! <eos> \n",

Does the harm economically and like, psychologically, make this enough of a pressing issue? For me the main grievance is seeing \"SEx\" in all my classes.

There is literally nothing I can do short of having someone hold my fucking hand and tell me what to do every 5 minutes. The readings dont prepare you for shit, the lectures go way too fucking fast and I have never understood a single one. I've gotten 100% on all the MPs so far, am now up to objects. Most of this I have done by having someone else tell me what to do. I have not missed a single class. Variables and other java functions are mentioned out of nowhere as if I suddenly acquire the knowledge on how to use them by reading it. This class is not an introduction to jack shit, it's a class for the cs nerds in high school to boost their GPA and fuck around practicing code. <eos> \n",

If it's that bad and I'm probably not gonna get an A in it anyway, should I just take STAT 100 as booster? Also- due to other class commitments I know I will have much less time to dedicate to ECON202/STAT100 during that semester, while I will have a bunch of time to put into ECON203 during that next semester... Which is why I'm wondering if STAT 100 is feasible.  Anybody have any experience with this? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm really posting this with hopes of a response from Campus Police or Police Chief Jeffrey Christensen. We have received multiple emails that include the following: \"...a student was sexually assaulted...at a fraternity house in Champaign...\". There are something like 20 fraternity houses in Champaign. Telling us it happened at a fraternity in Champaign is like saying there is a fire in a building on the quad. Why tell us that it was in a fraternity house without telling us which one? Last semester one of the emails said it happened at a fraternity house on south first street. By doing that it makes people skeptical to go into any of the 3 (maybe 4 if you include Pikes) houses on first street. What if it happened at a house in Urbana? Would you say that it happened in Urbana and narrow it down to the 3 relevant houses over there? It just doesn't make sense to throw all fraternities under the bus when then happens. Please either stop saying it happened at a fraternity and giving all of us a bad name, or say which house it happened at. There is really no reason to hide which house it happened at, and maybe if you started calling them out, this might not happen as frequently. Sincerely, A fraternity member at U of I <eos> \n",

This will direct you to a screen that lists their various \"package\" options, which begin at over $100.

            "<bos> A professor who was scheduled to teach a class next semester recently passed. I was signed up for the class and haven't heard any communication on what is going to happen to it. I will contact the department offering the class at some point, but I don't want to do it right away because it feels a little callous to be talking about a class when somebody just died... Does anybody have experience with an issue of this sort?  Edit: Thanks for the responses, all, it's reassuring to know that the class will likely not be cancelled. Super sorry I couldn't take it with the previous professor (I'd heard great things), but I'd be happy to take it in any case.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey r/UIUC, Since half the people here seem to be CS majors… does anyone else here use [Pretty Good Privacy]([url link] (PGP)? Would you be interested in getting together to sign each others’ keys? I figure we can just do it at one of the r/UIUC meetups, since anyone interested will likely be there anyway. (Signing keys at a bar… [what could possibly go wrong?]([url link] (If you don’t know what PGP is—it’s a piece of software that does encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. For example, a common use is to encrypt your e-mail correspondence and to digitally “sign” it so that people can be sure that your messages really came from you. If you want to know more, read [this introduction to cryptography]([url link] or [this introduction to PGP]([url link] or PM me.) **Edit:** Okay, if you’d like to get your key signed then bring the following to this Friday’s meetup: 1. Government-issued photo ID. (Make sure not to get your “I’m 21” ID confused with the real one, if you have two…) 2. Multiple copies of a printout that includes the following info:   * Your name (the name on the key should match the name on your ID)   * Your PGP key fingerprint (40 hexadecimal digits)   * The sizes, types, and IDs of your subkeys   * A list of the UIDs you want signed—just including your e-mail address will probably suffice for this 3. A pen, so you can make notes on the printouts the other people give you. I think we should have few enough people participating that this ad hoc method will work fine. Comment or PM me with questions. See you Friday! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I took an ACP class this semester with the expectation that it would improve my writing skill. In the syllabus, the TA outlines the writing work that we'll be doing but all we've done so far is write a single essay and spend a single class doing peer review, and have not ever discussed writing at all. I am kind of disappointed, because I did want to improve my writing. Are other ACP classes like this, or is my TA just slacking? I know a lot of people want to get the advanced comp requirement out of the way but this isn't really what I was expecting. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi,  So I’m taking a class right now that honestly has pretty garbage exams. I’ve done barely ok/struggled a lot on every single exam so far (I feel slightly more comfortable with one type of exam than the other) but on my last exam in this course I really messed up, earning my lowest score for exams of that type.  I felt really down about it but started feeling better until I actually reviewed the exam. I found out that I got basically a zero because of a few trivial (trivial to make) errors in my solutions. I know I could have written my own test cases, traced out my code, or been more careful but at first I just felt anger towards the structure of the exams.  Some of the bugs were clear to me as soon as I saw the exam in a stress free environment and I could have avoided others if I was able to calmly debug and trace my code, and this is something I don’t think these exams really let you do unless you’re immune to pressure.  I have a lot of this right now trying to meet a grade requirement for this class in order to get into a major and I’ve recently lost someone close to me.  Thinking about all of this is starting to shift my anger towards myself for being in this awful situation. It’s getting to be a lot (thought for a second about hurting myself).  I’m also starting to get anxiety about not being able to finish assignments, having bugs I won’t be able to find and worst of all I think I’m actually getting too anxious to learn the material. I’m afraid to learn it because I’m afraid I won’t understand it and then mess up my exams and miss the grade requirement.  I’m starting to get better about these things though, and will 100% do almost everything I can to improve in this course, but I just want some advice on how to feel better in my head. How can I deal with what’s going on in my head in a healthy way? I just don’t want to feel like shit about myself and have this sinking feeling in my stomach or anxiety anymore.  Thanks.  <eos> \n",

I don't mind doing extra work, but I'm not a great writer and haven't really written anything since high school English years ago.  Some courses I'm considering are BTW 250, PHIL 100, and PHIL 104.

Then I have friends who say it feels the same as the city, except they’re in the middle of corn, and that they wouldn’t have a different routine (Go to school, go to the gym, movies on Friday, eat out, socially drink).  I’d like to know what the general communities opinion is on this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in Champaign vs the city for college? <eos> \n",

Just wanted to get an idea of what his consequences might be. He's freaking out he might get expelled, which seems a little over dramatic considering he's only done it once. Anyone have any experiences with this? Seems like the worst would just be him getting fired.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I get it's a hard class, I really do, but the questions asked on that exam were completely ridiculous. What's the point of writing an exam that the TA's say wouldn't even show up on a graduate level exam? The average on the last exam was already so bad, you'd think they'd try to make an easier exam to level out, but no. People were just submitting exams that had one or two things written down per question. Some people had entire pages blank. I know the class will still just be curved appropriately and there isn't really much to do at this point, but it's frustrating studying day in and day out just to be destroyed. I guess that's the ECE motto though. <eos> \n",

I got a 88%, while the class average was 65% so I didn't go over the exam too much. However, as I was studying for my exam tomorrow I noticed that the TA incorrectly took off 10 pts (the answer key was recently posted online to help student grade the test) Should I bring this up to my professor's attention or just let it slide even if I earned a higher grade. Also, the exam was in pencil so will the think I erased the incorrect answer and changed it for higher point? Thanks ya'll. Also, I just don't want to be seen a grade grubber by my TA's or professors, I just want point because I am probably fucked for tomorrows test. <eos> \n",

I'm looking for a group with which I can go shoot guns with on the weekend every now and then. I'd like to stay away from the shooting range in town because it's super expensive.

            "<bos> I worked in Dining Services from last November and expected to part on good terms on this last week however on the last 3 days, I accidentally woke up too late to go to work and since that was my last chance, I got fired I called and was told that while I definitely can use the part time job as experience, they would say that they are not going to rehire me if asked...which made me wonder, how much does a part time job in Dining Services even matter for internships and job applications? Are they actually even going to go so far to maybe call them for reference? This is very embarrassing when you only have 3 shifts remaining and you blew it. <eos> \n",

Anyone who actually knows facts instead of just what I have been told - care to comment?  <eos> \n",

I have been thinking about getting registered with DRES in order to manage my schoolwork better, but I am worried that they may not take me seriously unless I have an official diagnosis. I know they can do a test for you, but does this test for just learning related disabilities such as ADHD, or does it test for depression and GAD as well?  Have any of you gone to DRES for anxiety and depression before? What were your experiences like? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey, I'm currently a Math major at UT Austin, wanting to be a Computer Science major. I have a 3.97 GPA, but I didn't get in this semester at a transfer to the CS department at UT. I'm planning on applying again next semester, but just in case, I'm looking at other schools. Currently, I'm looking at UIUC, UMich, UCLA, UWashington, Berkeley, Cornell, Columbia, and UPenn. Anyway my point is, how difficult is it to transfer from UT to UIUC as a computer science major with a 3.97 GPA? I have about 46 credit hours here, and I'm done with Calculus and a semester of physics with AP credit for statistics, non Calc based physics, and computer science. I'll be taking Linear Algebra and Probability this summer and Physics Electricity and Magnetism in the fall along with differential equations. The rest of my classes are just core classes. I also have an internship at Microsoft, a smaller web development company, and I'm working on a tech startup with a grad student and professor here at UT. It'll break my heart to leave Austin, but I need a computer science degree, and I think UIUC is a fantastic school and a great opportunity for me to do that. So, what do you think? Do I have a good shot? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> From Urbana High School web site: The UHS Homecoming Parade will be Friday, September 16 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. The parade will include the Homecoming King and Queen and their Court, UHS Marching Band, floats created by student committees representing student groups and grade levels, student athletic teams, and a variety of special guests and USD #116 administrators. The Court will also be introduced during the UHS boys varsity football game against Danville that evening. The parade route will begin at the high school on Race Street at Iowa. The parade will continue north on Race Street to Main Street, east on Main Street to Vine Street, south on Vine Street to Washington Street, west on Washington Street to Broadway Avenue and finish in the high school parking lot. Race Street will be closed to thru traffic between Iowa Street and Indiana Avenue beginning at 1:00 p.m. through the start of the parade. Once the parade starts, traffic along the parade route will only be obstructed for the time it takes for the parade to clear the area (approximately 15 minutes) on each leg of the parade. While we encourage supporters to watch the parade and cheer on our Tigers, drivers in the downtown area and around the high school may want to avoid this area during the parade times. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Everyone at Urbana High School and Urbana School District #116 appreciates the support the community shows to our students.UHS <eos> \n",

Pretty much it’s an app where you pick your school (UIUC) then find your class from a list of all UIUC courses, and add them to your profile. In each class is a thread where students taking that class can make posts where they talk about literally anything. I think a huge portion of students find themselves in a class where they don’t know anyone taking the class with them and then tend to fall behind compared to those who have friends they can work with and depend on. On [Yunipal]([url link] people can collaborate on assignments (with option to post anonymously WINK), talk about how hard yesterdays exam was, what people are doing to study, or even to crack a joke about something funny that happened in class. [Yunipal]([url link] will bring students together and be a platform where students can succeed together.  A finished mobile app will be available in the coming weeks but Yunipal is fully functional right now at [www.yunipal.com]([url link] where you can add your Fall 2018 courses. Also, there will soon be a campus-wide thread where anyone at U of I can post, and I’m speculating most of the activity will go down there.  Anyway, go make an account everyone and support one of your own UIUC students – I know my friend will greatly appreciate it! <eos> \n",

I don't have any donating opportunities, like \"hey, here ya go here's a free one!\" so I need to buy one. Just wondering if anyone has experience purchasing one...is it better to buy online or in-store? The places I've been shopping around online at have outrageous shipping fees so I'm wondering if in-store is the way to go. Any advice is welcome guys!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was in a relationship that became toxic and maybe even abusive near the end of last fall semester. I got a 3.9 my first year. I know it's my own fault for not knowing any better, but I got a 3.0 my second year. Summer classes have me back to a 3.53 for a ChemE. I had a Bio research internship over the summer, though. I want to work at NASA, but my mental state is horrible. I really don't know what to do. I want to do my best, but I feel like I am falling apart. I'm worried that a horrible relationship that lasted for two years ruined me in so many ways. I'm sorry, but please help. Can I still do what I want to do so badly?

            "<bos> Hi guys, I'm currently a sophomore in MCB (not premed) thinking about making the switch over to IB. While the MCB curriculum is obviously useful in many fields, I just feel like it's catered more towards premed kids. I'm also not sure if I enjoy the material enough to work with it for the rest of my life. I still love biology, and there is definitely some material overlap between both majors, but IB sounds like something more up my alley. I'm worried about a couple things though: 1. Everyone I've talked to seems to think IB is mindlessly easy or something. I'm sure that's not the case, but I'm wondering if there's any variance of job opportunities between graduating as an MCB major or an IB major. 2. Is it too late to make the switch? I won't be taking any 200 level IB courses this semester as we're already halfway through. Also taking Orgo I next semester. How hard will it be to catch up? 3. How hard is it to get into the honors program? Ideally that's what I'd like to do, but my grades aren't amazing or anything (hovering around the 3.3 range) so I was wondering if I would even have a shot at it. Sorry for the wall of text. I made an appointment with an adviser but that's not until Monday, and the drop deadline for some courses is Friday, so I'd like some input before then. Thanks for reading. <eos> \n",

I want to learn how to use SAS and obviously need the software to start. =) In fact, my old school had a webpage that listed each computer lab and the software those labs had installed, does UIUC have something similar? I tried searching but couldn't find anything like that.  Also if anyone had any tips on how about to go self-learning SAS (books, seminars, etc.) that would be greatly appreciated too.  <eos> \n",

Just a quick look at the scorecard is all the information I have on the place but it seems like a fairly legit course (6600 yds from the regular tees). Anyway, questions: 1) Have any of you all ever played it? Did you like it? 2) If any of you have played the Orange and the Blue courses, which do you prefer? 3) Is the course in decent shape? Or (and I ask because of the price) is it kinda beat up and dried out in places? 4) How crowded is it normally? Could I expect to walk on and play as a single at 3:00 on a Tuesday? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am a junior in Engineering Physics. I am currently trying to choose a technical option route for my major (this will allow me to find a specialization). If the school approves of my courses, that would allow me to pursue one of my passions: Computational Fluid Dynamics. In order to do so, I would have to take either TAM 325, or ME 310. I would choose the ME 300 and 310 sequence, but it says I need to be in ME or NPRE to take ME 310. I also am a junior so taking TAM 211, 212, and 325 would take away my remaining semesters and it would leave almost no room for other courses that I'd have to take for Computational Fluid Dynamics. Is there any way that you think I could get credit for Statics and Dynamics when I take PHYS 325? I'm sorry if this was a long read. I appreciate any help. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, I’m an older student (male, 25) that just moved to champaign last semester. Although I’ve made friends with a number of students in my classes, most of them (as expected) are much younger than I am. Even though its been cool, I would like to meet some people that are older (preferably 21+). It’s been pretty tricky meeting more mature students because I’m still an undergrad and rarely seem to come in contact with any.  Although I do feel confident that it is an issue that would resolve with time, I’m only gonna be around CU for about 1.5 years, so I figured I would try accelerate the process. Since this community seems to be pretty cool, I thought I might just try my luck here :) Some brief info about me: Since graduating high school, I’ve technically lived in 3 different continents. I chose to travel and and unorthodox work experience while at it, before finally deciding to complete my engineering degree (I’m technically in my junior year thanks to a bunch of college credits I’ve accumulated over the years). I’m a huge fan of music (played in a few bands too) and would probably qualify for being an audiophile. I also love video games (both PC and Console). My coursework keeps me pretty busy during the week so I’m basically looking for some friends to kick it with over the weekends. Im down to hit some bars, chilled hang outs, or even just grab some beers and playing some video games. Pretty open to whatever, really.  If anyone’s down to kick it, or if you have any questions, feel free to DM me. Thanks! EDIT: P.S. I just created a throwaway account to preserve my anonymity. The post is legit. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> On campus, I just have the sense of feeling that whoever that has accompanied would just leave one day and disappear from life. Maybe life can continue, but memory and emotion leave and wander, especially to someone I dare not express such feeling or emotional attachment. This makes it even tougher when I think about parting in the future anyway. How would you normally deal with such feel and the sorrow caused by concealing the feel? Any suggestion or past experience would help... <eos> \n",

            "<bos> We sincerely appreciate your interest in the College of Media, but regret to inform you that your application to the Advertising major for the Spring 2012 semester has been denied. As you know, the Advertising major is very popular and entry into it is increasingly competitive. Our applications’ committee reviewed many fine applications and had to make some tough decisions.  I am a transfer sophomore, so I have no UIUC credit to show for. This is what I think led to me being rejected, because... I had a 3.37 GPA in community college and I literally took every class for Advertising besides Marketing. I am beyond disappointed and this puts at risk my goals at this school. I am only here for Advertising, and in a major that looks more like a sorority at points, I am baffled as to how I got bounced. The only consolation point is that I can try again in Spring but this fucks up my spring schedule. QUESTIONS: ----- Can I still register for Advertising classes despite not being in the advertising major? Is it possible to contest this in any sort of way? --- Extremely demoralizing news, especially when my course work needs this. Advice is appreciated.   <eos> \n",

We play at a fun pace that gives every player, regardless of experience, a chance to have a good time. If you don't have a stick, don't worry Michael brings about a dozen extra. And, if the dangle-meister title doesn't suit you, we have an extra set of goalie equipment. We hope to see you this Sunday!

            "<bos> This might be a semi-long post, so bear with me.  I'm a freshman who has always struggled with anxiety during tests. For most of high school, I managed to get by with a pretty decent GPA due to the fact that I would study for hours and hours on end. When exams came around, I could just think about how well I did on the last test... If I screwed this one up, my grade would still be recoverable. Here, it's different. It seems like there are three tests and a final that determine grades for most classes. That really got to me on my Calculus midterm. I was so worried that I didn't know what I was doing that I couldn't even focus enough to work through the problems without making an incredible number of basic mistakes. It wasn't that I didn't know the information or what to do... I just couldn't perform.  With more midterms coming up, I'm wondering if anyone else has struggled with this issue. If so, what I should do or who I should talk to about it in order to succeed? I took a C on that midterm above (I'm praying for a curve), but studying for days in a 200-level class only to get a poor grade is taking a lot out of me.  Side-note: I know it is necessary to study to get good grades! <eos> \n",

[but the deadlines table is somewhat confusing]([url link] They're both Masters degrees like any the in person ones right, as far as the degrees awarded being the same, except they're both non thesis based(correct me if I'm wrong). What's the deal with the deadlines though, if the professional online mcs and mcs in data science are the same as the professional master of computer science, why are the submission deadline dates different? And they're the same cost right?(19,200)? Here's a link to the two separate pages: [professional mcs]([url link] [online mcs(I think part of professional still?)]([url link] Edit: Can I even make the may 30th deadline, the data science page says thats the deadline for it, but what about pure CS track? <eos> \n",

CPM: CPM has still not emailed or called about the incident. On Friday, my mom spoke with CPM on the phone after I called to see if they might take this situation more seriously. The woman basically said they are going to email us with what they are going to do. We are waiting to see if they are going to take proper responsibility for destroying my car, or if they want to battle this out.  Since our insurance office has been/is closed until tomorrow (mon), we are going to call them first thing in the morning and let them know what happened so they can tell us what to do, and so they can ultimately fight it out with CPM. all i know is that i am not going to let CPM get away with destroying my car because they don't know how to upkeep a building, and i wont stop pursuing them.

I told them to email the account holder, so they asked for the email address (which Ameren should have on file). I told them I forgot the email, so they gave me a personal cell phone number with a 312 area code and told me to call back later tonight. Seems like the same thing as [this]([url link] <eos> \n",

Since U of I has such an historical campus and interesting campus, we feel like we might have missed out. It is for this reason that we are planning a walk around campus to explore and find out more about the campus. So what cool places/interesting facts can you guys share about the campus? <eos> \n",

I am no corporate shill, just a trying to get this site a bigger user base because it truly is a solution to getting railed by campus book stores. Is anyone else a fan? It is also 100% free, all you need to sign up is an @illinois.edu email address. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Freshman here in ME trying to find a gen ed to take next semester (preferably one that will bump my GPA). I'm interested in astronomy and am considering minoring in it (though I don't really know how useful this would be, should I do it even if it won't help me land a job?). Thing is, astronomy is a physical science gen ed, which isn't required for the ME sequence. Should I still take it because I'm interested and it'll help my GPA? I was also looking at CLCV115 and SCR115, but they don't mesh with my schedule well. <eos> \n",

A few days ago we published the latest version of Classwhole with the [most requested feature]([url link] -- same page scheduling.    Please check it out and let us know what you think. [classwhole.com]([url link]   ***** I'm also excited to announce that we've decided to open source our project. We decided that open sourcing the project would be the best way to help improve software for students.   Check it all out on [Github]([url link]   Under the hood, we rewrote a great deal of code and it feels better than ever. But of course, there will be bugs.

            "<bos> The exam is at Halloween night, and I don't have any parties to go.   Can I wear a costume to the exam room? Or does it violate any student code? Ok, I found a student code about wearing. \"... wearing of apparel which is conspicuous or not in good taste...\" in a section of hazing. This is not hazing, but I'm still concerned that my costume would fall into the category \"not in good taste\" <eos> \n",

I have a three hour class tomorrow and from what I can tell, you can't park at any one meter (at least not near my building at Fifth and Daniel) for longer than two hours. Are there meters nearby that allow you to park for more than two hours at a time? And how does the parking permit situation work? Are they lot specific? <eos> \n",

First time I used my @illinois.edu address, and afterwards I used @uiuc.edu for the second trial. I'm trying to finesse another trial from prime so if anyone knows of another variation that'd be cool. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys. I was a freshman at UIUC this last semester (fall 2015-sping 2016). My first semester went well (all A's and B's except for my chem class). Second semester was extremely hard, I have been dealing with anxiety and depression and it got pretty bad during second semester. This caused me to get F's and D's in my second semester. At first I was told i am being put on academic probation (which I was at least happy about because I had a chance to prove myself) and now I have been notified that I have been dropped. I have just sent a re-entry petition. I have proof from my therapist that I was struggling because of my issues and that I'm now thriving and doing well in my summer classes (at a local community college) and holding a job at the same time. I'm just worried right now. Does anyone know if they'll accept my re-entry? I have proof from a medical professional that I am now much better and my first semester grades were decent. Does anyone know how they treat students who have a history of depression and anxiety? What are my chances of getting re-entry? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently a senior CE undergraduate that plans on going to graduate school after. I currently have a deadline this Monday for a company that I worked at last summer. I enjoyed the work there, but felt that the stuff I was doing was kinda boring and I want to try working at other places instead of sticking at one company(last summer was my first summer internship). I don't want to reneg the company due to both enjoying the place, and not liking the concept of renegging. What I'm worried about is if I say no to the offer, I won't be able to find anywhere else and will be screwed for the summer. I've been applying to places still and have around 4 places that haven't gotten back to me yet after I finished their coding challenge. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm currently enrolled in 400 with Stepanov (I have to get at least a B to be able to declare Statistics, right?).  Edit: I'm planning on double majoring in Statistics and Psychology so I'm also kinda wondering the same about Psychology 300+ courses. If anyone has any input, that'd be awesome!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I’m a freshman and I post here a lot because I find that advice from upperclassmen is among the best advice you can get.  So I have IB 150 and I’ve been doing OKAY . I got A’s on the first three quizzes but on the most recent one (the fourth quiz) I got a C. As someone who’s generally been at the top of their class, it’s challenged my preconceptions of studying. I’m not sure if sitting down, reading, memorizing and then applying it to small examples will work anymore.  Because of that, I’ve been stressed out. Has anyone else dramatically changed the way they study? If so, how?  I’m trying to find alternate ways to learn more efficiently and I was wondering what some of you guys have done and/or recommend.  I realize that everyone is different in the way they learn, but I’m just curious.  Thanks! :)  <eos> \n",

We're still having a blast, holding monthly events, and steadily growing (we're now at 55 couples)! Anyway, I figured I'd let you know about our next event, which is our first *really big* party, which we're super excited about. Country Club and Rehab (a club in Chicago) are combining forces and meeting halfway in Crete, IL to host a total takeover of an amazing venue... for a champagne pool party! We're calling it [Champagne Flutes  Bathing Suits]([url link] The clothing-optional, private venue has a heated pool and two hot tubs, a dance floor, and multiple playrooms. The party starts in the afternoon and goes until midnight; champagne and food are provided. Application, tickets, and info are at [lifestylecountry.club]([url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I've been driving around campus for 13 years and thankfully avoided accidents.   Lately, however, I've had quite a number of close calls.  Why?  Swarms of pixies flying across the roadways with total disregard for their surroundings.  You'd think they were specifically trying to get hit or something.  The green ones are the worst, because they seem to like pulling on windshield wipers.   If you are one of the people breeding them in your dorm room, please be aware that they are medieval creatures without much ability to appreciate hazards of modern life such as cars and busses.   For their own safety, it's best to pay that $5/flock fee to use one of the pixie exercise times in the Armory. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm looking to apply to be a grader for a math and CS course for the Spring semester. I googled \"math grader uiuc\" and there was an expired form for 2013. Are graders only hired at the beginning of the year? In Siebel, I recall seeing flyers requesting graders for CS and math courses. What's the typical process to become a grader? Do they hire per semester, or for full years? How technical are the interview processes, assuming I got As in the courses? What's the pay like? Also, does UIUC hire undergrad TAs for CS classes? Thanks! <eos> \n",

Lots of cop cars swerving in from down Green St. pretty fast.

            "<bos> Hello UIUC - Our EWS team asked me to share this with the world...or at least you. On Friday afternoon, we finally got the EWS lab in the east end of 4th floor Grainger operational. A lot of people have been asking about the study carrels that used to be in this space. They're still around, but they've been moved to the 2nd and 3rd floors to create enough room for this EWS setup.  In the 4th floor east lab, we currently have 40 workstations that are up and ready to go. We’ll be adding 15 more eventually, but we’re waiting on data to be run to the desks.  32 of those are set at [larger L-shaped desks]([url link] which might be useful for projects that require collaboration. In the meantime the desks are there and people can use those. The computers are running a Windows 10 Beta, and if you provide us feedback about it (using the form that’s listed on the desktop backgrounds), you can win free EWS printing credit. If you have any questions, feel free to email ews@illinois.edu. And if you want to see where EWS systems are available, you can always check [here]([url link] Have a great rest of your weekend! -EngrIT Outreach e: if where is not a thing <eos> \n",

            "<bos> (Cut and pasted from another thread) We carried about 100,000 passengers in the past year. Imagine what would happen on a day when we're running 75 buses (as we did on three occasions this academic year) if 5% of the students decide to ride the wrong bus, ask for a bus to wait for them, claim they bought a ticket but forgot to bring it, or in general ask for special treatment. Imagine the effect that all of this would have on the other 95%. It would be chaos. We have a few very simple rules. Bring a printed ticket. Don't try to get on a bus you can't get a ticket for because it's sold out by using a ticket for another date. Don't try to get two rides when you have only paid for one. Don't try to ride with a counterfeit ticket. Most people find these rules quite reasonable, and most follow them. Unfortunately, about 1/10 of one percent of our customers choose to try to cheat us. When we detect a cheater, we send them a letter asking that they make good on their deal with us. When they refuse, we ask the court for assistance in collecting the money that is owed to us. If we don't pursue cheaters and recover the revenue that is owed to us, the cost of tickets will go up for the honest passengers. Also, if we let the cheaters skate, we'd have more and more cheaters. <eos> \n",

I really appreciate the amount of effort that both of you are doing to try to make the class more reasonable. I think people get caught up in the pitch forks and forget to see that the people they are insulting at their professors and people too. Any professor could of ignored that criticism and passed it off as students being angsty. It takes a great professor (or person for that matter) to admit they were wrong in some aspect and try to change. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So, I left work tonight to find that my car has been scratched/keyed a third time since last fall. This time, it's about 3 feet long and very noticeable. My brother took a look at the first two scratches a month ago and said they weren't deep enough to rust, and that I might be able to get them buffed out at least to make them less noticeable. I don't want to spend an arm and a leg on a few scratches, but I'd really like to take care of them, since the car isn't that old and is in very good condition otherwise. Does anyone have a recommendation for a place/person that could at least try to buff them out, or if necessary, fix them for a fair price without trying to nickel and dime/overcharge me?

I'm asking the community if they know any steps to take to get my friend enrolled. Anything that can help get the ball rolling, be it a contact in the department or emergency dean.

            "<bos> Hi in my eng 101 class they talked about the mechse department and both majors in it seemed interesting but at the end he basically said its impossible to change into mechanical engineering due to space issues. Both majors are pretty similar but I kinda like how you can specialize in something in eng mech. I'm actually pretty interested in biomechanics, but it also looks a bit harder than mechanical engineering. Main point is can someone in the major give me some pros and cons of it. I would like a students perceptive of it. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> There has been a lot of concern in other posts about difficulty in registering for CS 374 in the fall. Among the comments, I tried to explain that this is a temporary situation due to a restriction error. I just ran some projections which show that we probably will not have a problem - I thought I'd post it separately here so it wouldn't get lost in the sea of angst. For CS students, if you define \"CS374-ready\" to mean \"will have completed CS 225, 233, and 241 by the end of this semester, and have yet to take CS 374\", then there are only about 75 CS students with senior standing who are CS374-ready.  Plenty of room among the 400 seats. Since CE is usually not as big as CS, the bulk of the seats should be available for CS374-ready students with *junior* standing, of which there are only 170 in CS. Not sure how many on the CE side, but again, likely less.  Thus, just the fall alone should be enough to allow a majority with junior standing to take the course in the first semester of their junior year, and the additional 400 seats in spring '17 should allow the rest to complete it by the end of their junior year without any problem.    <eos> \n",

My co-creators and I have set up a simple 4f correlator/optical computer so we can show the fourier transform of an image. We are having some trouble and would like to test the idea on a real optical table (rails, good lenses) etc. On purpose we have set up a low-budget one; one that a viewer could build and play with. Any one on campus with an optical apparatus and some interest in helping? Respond here, email me, text me, IM me, friend me somewhere ...  <eos> \n",

I know it's been said this is a gateway for internships but I'd like to know what companies would be more willing to hire someone after taking this class?

I already signed a contract for university housing at Wassaja for next year, and I think it’s really expensive and a rip off now so I don’t want to live there. But I think I can get out of it by signing a new one with a different room and canceling it? (If you know anything about that please people me know ) To get to it, I receive a good amount of financial and I want to know what will I continue to receive if I switch from the university dorms? I receive a bunch of pell grants and I take out like 6k in loans I think.  <eos> \n",

I took AP Physics as a junior in high school (scored a 1 but got 2 B's in the class). Anyone have experience with and know how difficult 211 is in general and compared to 100? I need to get good grades to get into the school of business or engineering but i also don't want to use 2 credit hours on a course that does nothing in terms of my graduation schedule, any suggestions? Thanks! <eos> \n",

He told us the main 3 lectures that would be on the final so I pretty much memorized them except one lecture was really long so I had trouble. The terms we did a jeopardy on and I looked them up and made note cards then memorized. Wants me to do a memory test. Claims stuff that I could not look up I did poor on which doesn't make sense since I struggled somewhere. Already filed a report on me. Wants to meet next semester which I feel is a bit late. a TA literally stood next to me the entire exam but when we meet he probably won't remember. Can someone tell me what I should do I did extremely well in m other courses and I really don't want an F <eos> \n",

My GPA is barely a 3 and I realized I could get a similar career path by majoring in finance. So if anyone of you previous engineers switched into the COB I would like to hear your experience as well as the process you took to transfer. I might be able to pull off a 3.4 this semester and have all the required classes under my belt.  <eos> \n",

At the university my brother attends, he's part of an investing club which has quite a sizeable fund that club members manage. Members meet biweekly and discuss both the club fund and personal investments. Is there anything like this at UIUC? I tried googling this but I only see College of Business stuff. I'm not into finance, investment banking, or even business, really. But I am interested in personal investing. I suppose I'll just look around for an RSO like this on quad day. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> What do people like about this place? I feel like at any moment Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and fill me in on the joke. I’ve given it four tries across both locations, and every time it has been either incredibly underwhelming or flat out gross.  I just don’t get it. The sauces aren’t good. Only 1-2 of them are even edible in my opinion. The meat is incredibly fatty, regardless of the type. I’ve yet to have a side that tasted decent. So what is it? Is it just one of those things where at some point someone was told that it was great, so they began to tell other people it was great, and so on and so on?  The staff has always been pleasant; I’ll give them that. However, that’s hardly enough to counteract the food.  <eos> \n",

I wondered if there was any one willing to be interviewed that had AP credit before coming to the U of I who wasn't able to use their credit and wanted to talk about it, or if there are any students wanting to talk about how this new procedure will help/hurt students?

Just tracked the lost one for fun, says it's an hour away from me. **Actual Question:** if I receive the lost package with already receiving the the replacement, do I **legally** have to return it?

Besides the regular sliding around campus (off the top of my head, jimmy johns, cravings, walgreens, and quadshop in union), the biggest things I've done in the last few days is I've set up my thanksgiving transportation. I've set up rides with amtrak, megabus, and LEX.  Now, I remember there was a thread on this about a year ago, but I'm posting this again, partially to remind people to check their statements, but also because I'd like some sort of inkling as to where it went wrong. Personally, I've got a sneaking suspicion it was LEX. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm a high school senior from a small charter school in Chicago. I'm part of the first graduating class(idk if relevant), and I am currently stuck deciding between two colleges: Illinois Intitute of Technology(IIT) or University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign(UIUC). I've been accepted to both already, and I plan on studying Computer Engineering at both. Cost will be a little less at IIT than UIUC, thanks to a few scholarships, and I have a chance at getting a full tuition scholarship there. I also will not have to pay room and board there, since I live like 20 min away.  UIUC has been my dream school for a while now, though. Both me and my best friend have been wanting to go there, and I have been to the campus three times already. I have loved it all three times, and I like the general atmosphere there. Also, I will gain independence of I go there, but I will also close enough to come home if needs be. My parents keep haggling me about staying close to home and going to IIT, but I am really considering going to UIUC. Sure, the thought of being able to come home after class is appealing, but I also want to go out and experience life!(My parents are very strict). I also want to be more independent, and do things on my own.  I know this was long, but any opinions on what school I should choose? <eos> \n",

I already know about the ones in the union in the south lounge and courtyard cafe, and I have used the practice rooms in the music building. I'm looking for pianos that are available to play on the weekend, though, and the practice rooms aren't open then. I live in Urbana, so the six pack is kind of far away for me.

She has mentioned being interested in taking a cooking class together before, and I would love to indulge that. I have unfortunately been unable to find anything in the area that a non-UI student could take, even looking ito Parkland I wasn't able to see anything.  We are already fairly good cooks, so it doesn't need to be an intro class, but we also aren't in the restaraunt industry, so I would love a class that is more about home cooking with cool techniques, etc.  Does anyone have any ideas? Also, all of our friends are out of town this weekend and it's supposed to rain. Any ideas for fun stuff to do on Saturday/Sunday? Thanks!!! <eos> \n",

I know some people have purchased Comcast Business plans for their homes with reportedly better connections and no cap for similar or slightly higher pricing. Anyone done this in Urbana-Champaign? <eos> \n",

I’ve basically learned nothing this semester and I know I’m not gonna get a passing grade. Even though I know I’m not gonna pass, it’s still hard to accept this and overall I’m just really disappointed in myself. I’m gonna try to study the exam 1 material since it’s the easiest but I doubt it’ll make much of a difference. I just wanna get this Chem exam over with and go home. Does anyone else feel this way?

It's a Canon Rebel T2i with a 17-50*mm Sigma lens attached. It's in a black Case Logic bag with a small orange strip on the front. I called CUMTD and the Union, but they haven't found anything yet. If any of you have seen it by chance, please send me a PM. Reward will be a meal at the restaurant I work at. Thanks! <eos> \n",

And I will double check that with an advisor this week.) CS 361 is turning out to be more work than I expected: 15-20 hours or more per week, and I have already used up one late submission (48 hour extension), and likely to use another late submission on homework 4. The homework is significantly more complex and difficult than the examples given in the text or lecture. I have given the class every weekend this semester, and I'm still unable to keep up. I'm fairly demoralized by this. I'm considering dropping CS 361, and signing up for Stats 400 next semester instead. Has anyone here taken Stats 400, and can advise on the workload? I don't even mind spending a lot of time on the homework, but it would be nice if the learning curve was not so steep, so I don't get so stuck on every other problem. I was going to take CS 361 because it sounded cool; but now I'm mainly concerned about passing my classes so I can graduate on time. Thanks for your thoughts. <eos> \n",

Considerable effort has been, and continues to be, spent to resolve these issues. The lab performance problems have likely seemed like a regular repeat of the same problem. Unfortunately for us, we have struggled with a series of different technical issues that have all caused the same end result: abysmally slow workstations and disrupted homework assignments.  Our performance problems are caused by our storage infrastructure, a setup that essentially took a single department-scaled solution and grew it to handle the entire College. Even though technical issues rather than capacity issues have been the primary problems, just scaling that solution was a mistake and one that I take full responsibility for. We are now going to do what we should have done much sooner: throw away our current storage infrastructure.  To implement an immediate solution, we are going to repurpose a number of new servers acquired for a different project. We have been actively talking with one of our peer Engineering colleges of comparable size and are going to mirror a configuration they have been successfully using.  For beyond this semester, we are going to do multiple things in order to ensure we never repeat these problems. First, engage instructors to better understand what they need EWS to be able to support for their courses. Second, engage students to better understand their work patterns and expectations for EWS. Third, bring in additional outside expertise (as we’ve done with our peer college for the short term solution) to assist with designing our long term storage solution.  We take great pride in the historical quality of the EWS labs and it pains us that these performance issues have occurred. I thank you for your feedback and patience and offer my apologies once more as we start down the road to rebuilding your confidence in the EWS labs and our ability to adequately manage all aspects them. We will be posting regular status updates and additional information to [url link] as we progress with both the short term and long term improvements.

We will provide a way for remote attendees to ask questions. As soon as the logistics are worked out, we’ll announce it at [url link] and also via email.  Please feel free to contact me directly with any additional questions, comments, or suggestions that you have.\"  <eos> \n",

If you could fill out [this]([url link] survey for me, that would be great! Thanks! **Edit: Hopefully [this]([url link] one works. If not, I'll just post the questions here so people can answer them here. Thanks!** Edit 2: Well, it appears that you can't just share a link to the form anywhere, so I guess I'll just post the questions in here: 1. When you do laundry, do you consider energy and water consumption when deciding whether to cram clothes in one washer/dryer or to do it in two loads? (Yes/No) 2. Does the U of I, its staff, and its students do enough to be considered an eco-friendly university? (Yes/No) 3. If you think that the U of I, its staff, and its students could do more to be eco-friendly, provide some examples. (Paragraph form) Thanks! <eos> \n",

Anth 103 will be an 8 week course for the first 1/2 of the semester, and soc 100 will be an 8 week course for the second 1/2 of the semester.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently a sophomore in engineering here, and I never planned on being an engineer after I graduated. I wanted to go into business, but my parents and guidance counselor convinced me to do engineering because I did well in physics and math in high school and because engineering majors can get jobs in business too. However as i get farther into the engineering curriculum, I realize more and more that I'm not enjoying my classes. I know it's too late to transfer into business, so I'm just wondering is it doable to be happy and successful in major you dislike? Thank you and sorry for venting, I'm just starting to really regret my choice of major <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey fellow Illini, I've done a lot of poking around in the north campus and main quad buildings but I'm in a bit of a lull at the moment. It seems like I've been to most of the adventure locations people regularly talk about (the Noyes grave, a handful of rooftops, the Illini throne room, etc.) and I'm out of leads. If there's anyone out there who is experienced in urbex, I'd love to possibly share locations or talk about discoveries (all the brewing-looking gear in attics is still on my mind). Hit me up with a PM if you'd like to talk. EDIT: Just a note. This is not Alex. This is not Peter, this is not Huang, and I'm not your TA. My name sounds like Mathan Sealmouse. <eos> \n",

I heard winters here can get a lot worse than New York, so I was just wondering, what should I get to prepare? Back in New York I had a really thick northface jacket, boots, hat, gloves, and I would typically wear jeans, and a shirt under the jacket, maybe a hoodie under the jacket as well if it got really cold. Would this be fine for a winter here, or do I need better gear to prepare? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm going to try to keep this as anonymous as possible, but when in class, I can't help but notice that the professor teaching the course smells very bad. At first I thought this was just the general aroma of the room, but then the professor walked right by me and I realized they were distinctly giving off an odor of oniony stinkiness. The worst part is, the smell stuck with me for the rest of the day. Is there any polite way to resolve this situation? Serious replies only <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I've recently been fascinated by this branch of mathematics and I'm looking to explore this area a bit more. Does anyone know of any courses offered at the UofI in this specific area? Or any other resources (web based/ actual classes) are also welcome. I'm a math/CS undergrad and I don't have excessive experience with this particular branch so I'm looking for something that will be more like an introduction. <eos> \n",

If you can tell me a) the name of the realty company on your tag and b) the color of the stone on your keychain I'll gladly return them! Hopefully the owner is a redditor. I'll also post in some facebook groups. If I don't hear anything in a few days I'm going to give them to the University Police. Edit: Turned them into the University Police. Call them if you think they're yours. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm considering whether or not I should rent the STAT 400 textbook for the coming semester. Is the textbook required to complete homework problems? (Statistics and Probability, Devore, 9th edition) Are assigned homework problems only available in the 9th edition of the book? I see the 8th edition is cheaper online. Alternatively, is the STAT 400 textbook available at the library(ies), so I could look up homework problems that way?

I am going to the south suburbs(orland park to be exact) and wouldn't mind driving another person home if it saves me a little money. As it should only be about 4-5 gallons of gas, it will probably be like $7-8 for you(unless we have more than one person, which I will probably accept a few dollars). I am leaving on Sunday, when on Sunday doesn't really matter to me. If I don't have anyone to ride with I'll just leave whenever I feel like it. Just shoot me a PM if you're interested and let me know what you're bringing. I am bringing a decent amount home, so I will want to know what will and will not fit in my car (its an impreza wrx, not that big). <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm in my fourth year, going into my second semester, and had intended to do a fifth year pursuing a second major. But I didn't know that OSFA SAP differed from College/Degree SAP and I've hit my cap. I have enough to graduate with my first major, but I was counting on having the second going forward, and have no plans set forth with my current status. Hell, I'm only halfway through my senior thesis. As you might expect, not knowing this difference, I took a lot of extra classes willy nilly and dropped those I was disinterested in and those I felt would harm my GPA had I continued. I have something like a 3.8 in my major and 3.61 cumulative, so it's not like I'm struggling or anything of the sort, I just didn't read the paragraph on OSFA's definition of attempted hours and now it feels like I'm completely screwed. Obviously I should have known better. But I didn't, and now I'm in this position. I will make an appointment with my advisor tomorrow, but besides that, what, if anything, can I do from here? <eos> \n",

Students have been playing the chime for as long as it's been here on campus (96 years). We're ultimately under the supervision of the chimesmaster, but last semester we decided to form an RSO in order to organize fundraisers and social events.  If you're interested in becoming a chimesplayer, please come to our informational meeting on **Thursday the 28th at 6 pm in Illini Union 404**. We're not part of the music department and you don't need to be a music major in order to join. However, while not a strict requirement, we strong prefer if you already know how to play an instrument, read sheet music, etc. and are already reasonably proficient.  Students enjoy playing the chime for different reasons. Our RSO's president is an extremely talented musician and plays a myriad of different instruments, organ, piano, ... The chime is a very unique instrument for him and he puts a lot of work into performing and arranging music.  *I* like making loud noises.  If you have a passion for music and think you'd enjoy performing for the entire campus (actually, I've heard the chime from several different places off campus in C-U), then I encourage you to come to our info. meeting next week!  (If you're interested but can't make it, shoot us an e-mail. No worries. You'll still be able to join.)   **E-mail: AltgeldRingers (at) gmail (dot) com** Facebook: [url link] (dot) com/AltgeldChimes <eos> \n",

Do you buy your own bread, milk and meat? Do you make the person that eats the most pay the most?

Any advice beyond groceries is more than welcome. <eos> \n",

The trackball doesn't work anymore (one of the rollers on the inside of the ball compartment broke), but the keyboard works just fine. The keyboard has seen 8 years of use. I'm selling the keyboard and a PS/2 to USB adapter that works with both the mouse and the keyboard (the mouse works only in one direction) for **$40 or OBO**.  This keyboard has served me well and I've loved typing on it, but I've moved on to a lighter keyboard with Cherry Blue Switches and I'm afraid I really don't want to take the effort and move it to a new apartment. <eos> \n",

I've canceled my class registration for the coming semester, but I'm not sure if that's what I need to do to \"stop out\". Everything I've read online says that we have the option to stop out for a semester or two, but doesn't actually say what we should do, or who to contact.

The NetID mentioned in the second one matches that of one of my professors, which might indicate that his e-mail has been hacked (he does not seem like the type to do something like this of his own accord). <eos> \n",

This means that our break is close to over, as school starts in roughly 10 days, the proficiency tests are starting, and any academic probation decisions shall be decided soon.

Even if you don't have the highest grades, even if you don't manage to get out too often, even if your well being isn't as high as it could be, you'll be okay.

            "<bos> Hey guys, this semester I was in kind of a rut which ended up with me getting below a 1.0 GPA. According to Code 17, a student who earns below a 1.0 will be dropped from the University. I spoke to my LAS advisor and she told me that they decide what to do with students who get below 2.0 GPAs on a case-by-case basis and that because this is my first semester below a 2.0 coupled with the fact that I'm still a freshman, I MOST LIKELY will only get academic probation next semester instead of being dropped. It was the 'most likely' part that is making me nervous, as I know there is no way to pick up my grades this semester. Has anyone been in a situation similar? And how did it turn out? <eos> \n",

I'm just curious as to whether or not there are any skilled woodworking enthusiasts/hobbyists in the area who would be willing to work on a small(ish) project for me (for pay, of course!). I know of the [CU Woodshop]([url link] but I'm pretty sure you have to take classes or something and I really doubt I can do this myself without losing a hand. Anyway, if you know anyone who would be willing to hear me out on this, that would be great, and be sure to let them know I'd be willing to pay them for their time and effort! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was pickpocketed by a very skilled person in the Union today around 1:30PM. I paid for my lunch at Jamba Juice then walked through the union to the bus stop on green street and discovered that my wallet was missing. There was no cash in my wallet so all you walked away with was my identification and unfortunately for my family, my graduation tickets. To make matters worse, today is my birthday and now I cannot go out because I don't have any ID to prove my age.  I will give you a cash reward if you return my wallet and I won't even call the police. I just need my stuff back! PM me and tell me color of my wallet and the key and/or keychains attached and we can arrange your reward. Again, I'm not going to turn you in, I just want to get a drink on my birthday! EDIT// Yes. I retraced my steps. This all happened in 5 minutes or less. No I did not merely drop my wallet because I would have noticed. It was in the side bottle pocket of my backpack. Where I have put it for years.  I am not going to the police because I work in criminal justice and know the consequences this person would face if found. One bad day for me is not worth ruining someone's life. As I said before- I just want to get my stuff back.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> There's this school that a friend of mine is attending, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Their enrollment is 380 students total. UIUC has an enrollment of ~48,000. A human body contains 126,000 calories, and suggested daily intake is about 2,000. Olin's population, therefore, contains 47,880,000 calories. UIUC must consume 96,000,000 per day, almost exactly twice as much as the caloric content of Olin. Ergo, if it came down to it, we could literally eat Olin for breakfast. <eos> \n",

While the theatre is a few miles away from campus, the 1 Yellow takes you right to it (the stop is Lyndhurst  Burwash (NW Corner)).

My name is Kyle and am from the lovely C-U surrounding area and figured I'd do some (hopefully shameless) plugging for the newest haunted house in the area! If anyone is looking for plans this year for Halloween, or any weekend in October for that matter, my friends and I would absolutely love to see you guys at the newest haunt in the area! We're located in Rantoul and between the 4 owners and myself, we've all been in the haunted house scene for roughly 15 years. If you're fortunate enough to remember the lovely Haunted Dungeon located at The Aquarium in Rantoul, we ran that for the last 5 years that it was going on. Feel free to visit us on Facebook at Necrosis Haunted House and on our website www.217fear.com Hope you all are having a great back to school so far and have a fantastic rest of the year!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I rented one of my textbooks off of Barnes and Noble and to return the book it says \"Simply print our rental return shipping label and packing slip, pack your rental books and return packing slip, and return them via UPS.\" On the website I have found the shipping label, but cannot find the packing slip anywhere and have no idea what that is. I even called customer service and she said she'd send me the shipping label when I asked for the packing slip. She first stated that they were the same thing then she stated they were different. I asked if she could send me the packing slip through email and she said she couldn't. I just wanted to know if anyone had any experience returning books through Barnes and Noble and how you shipped it back. Thank you!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I'm sure this kind of lamentation has been posted a billion times already, and I've already thoroughly reviewed [this]([url link] post by /u/IllinoisTCC. But I just can't seem to be satisfied with any of my options for this summer and it's starting to bum me out. See, as a Music Technology student there's not much I can do as far as research opportunities or other jobs/internships on campus (except for technology-related things like IT Services, which I did at the Athletics Department two summers ago). Despite applying to dozens of internships with big companies around the country, I only landed one in LA that only offered a $500 monthly stipend - definitely not enough to cover living costs, and not enough to make the \"experience\" worth it IMO, so I turned it down. So at this point it basically leaves me with no options as far as productivity goes. I can either stay in CU and do nothing, or I could move back home to the North Shore and do nothing - but I'd still have to pay some expenses (not full) for my living arrangement on campus if I do that. Last summer I was fortunate enough to essentially do nothing at home and still make money from music licensing opportunities, but seeing as how it's a for-hire situation I could theoretically make nothing this summer. **TL;DR of this whole rant, for anyone who cares to read it: I didn't get any worthwhile internships for the summer and there are little to no available jobs on campus that fit my skill set. What should I do?** <eos> \n",

It looks like CS473 isn't offered this semester though. What are some suggestions for some algorithms/logic/discrete math courses that I could take? I'm also looking at a somewhat difficult course load next semester, so if it pertains to similar topic material and the class doesn't take much time, that would be a bonus! <eos> \n",

I've decided on 4:20 PM for Friday in the Illini Union basement. I'll be (hopefully) setting up by the far side from Chick-fil-A/Sbarro. *End update* Hello Reddit. I've recently purchased the board game Diplomacy and I would like to organize a group to play it. Diplomacy is an epic game of politics and negotiation. Think Axis  Allies and Risk on steroids. I've never actually played it, but I've had my eyes on it for quite some time with the intention of playing some epic games. Am I using the word epic enough? Moving on, the game can be played with 2 to 7 players. Preferably, I would be able to round up 6 of you to help shape to the (fictional/alternate historical cardboard) world. If not, then so be it, but anyone who is interested in playing this, post in this thread or PM me.  I'm not sure where we would play (I don't feel my apartment would be a suitable place even though I would love to host), the Union basement maybe? If someone who wants to play has ideas on that, talk here. Since games of Diplomacy can last several hours according to what I have read, the faint of heart need not apply. I'm looking to play the first game next weekend, either Friday night or on Saturday or Sunday. Cheers! <eos> \n",

Some things I'm interested in: entrepreneurship, cs-stuff, and anything fun really. A friend of mine told me that MUN is great, so I'm looking into that. Basically any club that is fun and where I can meet new people. <eos> \n",

Pretty much all of the engineers I've met at U of I are just so arrogant about it, and no offense, but you guys (as in the r/uiuc community) kinda come off that way too. It's like people who aren't engineers are just worthless. I know we're a great engineering school and all, but face it, the whole world can't be engineers. 1)We would die out because nobody would be getting laid and 2)There are more roles to be filled in society than engineering ones. Sorry for this. Just wanted to hear some other opinions. Also, kinda drunk. TL;DR: All of the engineers I meet are arrogant and scoff at those who are not engineers. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> If anyone passed by the southeast corner of 6th and Chalmers st. right in front of Newman Hall, you may have noticed a foul odor lingering in the air. This is because on the planters lining the side of the sidewalk in front of Newman Hall, there are a group of stinkhorn mushrooms. These bright red mushrooms are a tubular-shaped fungi, about 5 to 7 inches long, and their shape is similar to an ox's horns. These mushrooms are known notoriously for giving off a foul, stinky odor similar to rotting fish (hence the name \"Stinkhorn\"). They reproduce rapidly, often multiplying exponentially overnight... I don't know who to call to get rid of these things. All I know is that if they aren't taken care of, they will multiply and it will be harder to contain. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'll make this brief, recently two nuclear power plants in Illinois have announced that they will close prematurely unless the Illinois legislature does not act soon. I have a created a petition to urge Illinois state lawmakers to pass the legislation needed to stop the premature close of these plants to save JOBS and CLEAN ENERGY in Illinois. We've seen legislation recently passed in New York that recognizes nuclear plants for the clean energy they produce, I am hoping Illinois will do the same. Combined, the Quad Cities and Clinton nuclear power stations directly support 1,293 high paying jobs and indirectly support an additional 5,007 jobs in the surrounding communities! Together have an economic impact of $2.4 billion. The Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear power stations have a huge POSITIVE impact on environmental and public health. In fact, 90% of Illinois's carbon-free energy is produced by nuclear power plants and Illinois ranks #1 in the nation for clean, carbon-free energy. Closing these plants would be equivalent to putting 3.5 million cars on the road! PLEASE sign this petition and spread the word to show your support for clean, carbon-free nuclear power and jobs in Illinois! Sign the petition [HERE]([url link] THANK YOU  <eos> \n",

Mostly DC, Batman (and co), Green Lantern, Green Lantern Corps, Green Arrow, Countdown to Final Crisis, Supergirl, some specials, some of Final Crisis and Blackest Night. Also Red Hulk, marvel apes, Spiderman (almost everything from post civil war to 2009), age of apocalypse. I have a full list somewhere that I can provide. I'm not looking to sell isue per issue but rather would like to sell the whole thing to one buyer for about $150. Even if you're only intestested in half of it, it's still a very good deal compared to pruchasing back issues one by one.

I get it, poop is nasty af, and maybe you want to ditch that stuff right after you dump it, but come on. We all know that the only thing worse than your own poop, is someone else's poop. I don't care if you have to use your foot to flush it and run tf out of the stall, just please send that stuff down to the dark places where it belongs. Your poop should be for your own eyes only.

It's an event being held April 27th to promote environmental sustainability but the big thing is there's free food for volunteers, prizes people that participate in the weekly challenges, and food deals just for showing up to the event.

The stress of having to leave a university that you really wanted to go to (hopefully), having the possibility of not knowing where you are for half of your college experience and having to do all of your college apps one more time is not something you want to deal with. If you have an offer of CS from a similar school, go there. If you have a 4.0 while trying to transfer, you may not be admitted. Even just doing the \"CompE but I'll do a bunch of 400 level CS classes\" is nearly impossible as well now as they: A. Don't appreciate people who do CompE as a backup for CS (in fact you I don't believe you are allowed to apply for both) B: Have an acceptance rate that is approaching CS level. C: You'll probably hate yourself since you have to take some classes (ECE 210,ECE 385, ECE 391 come to mind) that you have no interest in ever doing.  I would never wish the two years of stress (and 10 years it took off of me) that DGS is on anyone. I personally consider transferring one of my greatest achievements (years of hard work and networking). If you want to do anything besides CS/ECE though you're (probably) good!   <eos> \n",

Students holding Graduate Assistantships (GAs) or Pre-Professional Graduate Assistantships (PGAs) will be required to pay taxes on tuition and fee waivers that exceed a value of $5,250 per calendar year. I just got this email:  If you are employed by the University during the summer of 2012, any taxes owed on your summer tuition and service fee waivers (resulting from your spring 2012 GA or PGA appointment) will be withheld from earnings from any University appointments you have in the summer of 2012 except for fellowship appointments.   Any taxes owed on your summer waiver (resulting from your spring 2012 GA or PGA appointment) that are not able to be withheld during your summer 2012 employment with the University will be withheld from earnings from any University appointments you have in the fall of 2012 except for fellowship appointments.   You are receiving this letter because University records indicate that you received tuition and service fee waiver(s) associated with a Graduate Assistantship (GA) or Pre-professional Graduate Assistantship (PGA) appointment during the spring 2012 term.  Currently I have a 12.5% RA and the rest fellowship. So my fellowship is considered a GA? Does this mean that because I have a fellowship I am going to be making significantly less money, almost no money at all, after paying tax on tuition waiver? Next year I start my NSF Fellowship funds, will that count me as a GA again, and require me to once again pay taxes on tuition and service fee waivers? If I am reading into this correctly it is complete bullshit. I am going to be punished for having a fellowship this year and the NSF fellowship for the next 3 years such that my resulting take home pay will be much less than if I were just a full RA or TA  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, so I didn't see the competitive smash RSO on quad day, but it's very clearly listed on the list of RSOs. Honestly, since I'm not very good, I'm just looking for a place to go and play some video games with some random people, not really keen on entering tournaments, but does anyone here know if they have a facebook group or discord or anything like that? And if not that club, then the social gaming club or whatever, because honestly finding information about RSOs is a bit of a nightmare :( <eos> \n",

            "<bos> OK, I am pretty desperate, and while I might have a lead from someone I know, I figure it is better to hedge my bets and have a backup plan. So here is the deal: I am having some surgery Thursday afternoon at Carle in Urbana and I live in Rantoul. I would rather not spend overnight at the hospital, and the only way I get out of this is to have someone drive me to/from the hospital (I will be going under for this). I spent last week in the hospital and it sucks. I know next to no one locally (all of my co-workers are in Danville). R/UIUC, you are my hope! You get the following from me: gas $$$, some $$$ for your time, at least a couple of meals, massive amounts of gratitude and real life karma. PM if you are responsible, super-kind, and able and willing to help. Thanks so much!!! <eos> \n",

Anybody have any stories about her that she can read here and tear up some more? If you're reading this Cinda (Prof Heeren? Why does nobody say that)-- I only ever actually talked to you two weeks ago in office hours, but I regret not doing it sooner. Never in my life have I met someone with such an infectious personality, whose aspirations and worldview are so fierce they become your own.

The ones that are available clashes with my other classes.  I've contacted my advisor and she says that I can make changes Friday before school starts. By then, will there be more sections in Math 221 open? Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> To all undergraduate students: The High Performance Computing (HPC) community here at the University of Illinois is looking to assemble a team of undergraduate students that will design, build, maintain, and utilize a high performance compute cluster to compete in the Supercomputing Conference's (SC) Student Cluster Competition (SCC) in the Fall 2018 semester. SC has been the premier HPC conference since 1988 and features the presence of the world's leading industry and academic organizations in supercomputing. The Student Cluster Competition itself is a high-profile, nonstop 48 hour competition where various teams from around the world build custom cluster computers and compete with each other to obtain the fastest benchmarking scores. The Illinois team is sponsored by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Parallel Computing Institute (PCI) at Illinois. If the team is accepted to the competition, students will travel to Dallas, Texas in November to compete in SCC. The team will be meeting through part of the current spring semester and throughout most or all of the summer and Fall semesters to plan and prepare for the competition. Students who apply to the team are expected to be familiar with or interested in Linux system administration, parallel computing, and HPC architecture, and are also expected to invest 8 hours a week during the summer and fall semesters. Students will have the opportunity to apply for anywhere from 1-4 independent study hours through the ECE or CS department. There are also opportunities for summer internships and research experience for members of the team. For more on the Supercomputing Conference and the Student Cluster Competition, please visit: [url link] [url link] Interested students should submit their applications to the following link: [url link] (You must use your Illinois Google account to fill out the form) Questions about the team or competition can be directed to this post or as a private message. <eos> \n",

I read through the multitude of mechanic threads, but this shop is the closest to my work that isn't a chain shop and did not see it mentioned. This is the only shop that would actually allow me to drop off my car and walk to work. So I was wondering if anyone has heard about this place? Good or bad experiences?  If not, i'll prob. take it to Dyno-Tune in Urbana since they were mentioned a few times and just request half the day off or something. it's near my apartment at least.  <eos> \n",

Away to the window I flew like the flash  Tore open the blinds and the window with a crash  The moon on the breast of the newly cleaned street  Gave the luster of St Patty’s day to the drunks on their feet  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear  But a gigantic keg, and eight enormous cheap beers  With a little old redhead, so wasted and daft  I knew in a moment it must be St Pat  More rapid than eagles his beverages they came  And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name! “Now Natty! Now Keystone! Now, Blue Moon and Bud Light!  On Blue Ribbon! On Fosters on Busch and Coors light!  Go into the bars! Into the sororities and frats!  Now drink away! drink away! Until the whole world goes black!\"  Hope you like it lol Edit: Formatting fixes  <eos> \n",

I was flying through it until I get to the point where I have to pick two general education courses in each of the five categories. Given that I have no knowledge of the classes, and that I am an extremely indecisive person to begin with, I was looking for a bit of help or some suggestions on good classes to put down. I realize that what I put down isn't final, and that none of you really know what I'd be interested in, but I'd be open to anything really. <eos> \n",

The only change to the style sheets would be to shift the \"UIUC\" button and the various tabs over to the right a little bit so that \"UIUC\" is directly below the Alma Mater. I'm not really sure how this is done, but for anyone with basic coding experience, I'm pretty sure it should be an easy fix.  So without further ado: [[url link] And with the [tabs roughly pasted over]([url link] Please let me know what you think!

We have pride in our school because we have a student body like you! 2. We know you've all been working hard and studying hard, finishing papers and projects - all this BEFORE Final week! We do not take this for granted! 3. Finals are the culmination of the semester, a huge stress-bomb of trying to review massive amounts of what you've learned, while putting finishing touches on your semester's work, research, and projects. UI is challenging, and all of you are up to the challenge! 4. You will succeed! Destress and try not to worry so much! Worrying takes energy YOU NEED for studying and thinking your best! Worry  stress give you bad mojo hangovers!  5. Take care of yourself! Eat, keep hydrated, vitamine water, whatever caffeine-laden fuel you need... And SLEEP kids, for god's sake! You'll be at your best. I'm out here chillin' on Friday night and wanted to let you great young people know we're in your corner, on your side. All of you, and us, make this university what it is! You have the talent, and they're testing it. All part of the routine. No worries, I know you'll exceed expectations! -tip <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently struggling a lot in this class, and I don't think the office hours are enough for me to be able to understand the concepts and complete the assignments and do well in the exams. I think I would benefit from a 1-on-1 tutor to first give me a sort of crash course about what's been done till now, and with that base perhaps help me through the remaining semester. I have an exam this Friday so hopefully I should have a good enough base by then to do decently in it. I really don't want to fail this class, and I'm also on academic probation this semester so I'm extremely stressed about being kicked out of the university. I'm willing to pay for the tutoring, but I need someone who's done very well in this class and can teach properly. Please let me know if you can offer me this, if you know someone you can, or if there's anything similar I should look into. Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I made a post for sublessors and now one for subleasees. * Go cheap, max you should pay is 400/month. Try to find places that include utilities.  * Check out the place. Make sure they point out to you exactly which room will be yours. * For places that don't have a large company doing subleasing, they might not have a standard structure for subleases. Keep in mind. **GO** to the **tenant union** and ask them for a sample sublease form.  * To make sure you are not on the hook. Make sure that the sublessors pay their entire rent to the landlord for the rest of the summer before you pay them, so you don't get evicted in the middle of the summer. Ask them and confirm it with the landlord or get paperwork * Maintenance requests are checked less often for SOME landlords in the summer, so if the apartment already has a bad track record, be wary. This doesn't mean it'll be bad, just keep it in mind when comparing places. * If there's somewhere specific you want to live, look now. Although there's a lot of people who post in May, the best places go soon. Keep in mind you might pay more. * Be nice, and don't lowball people. If they pay 800/month, don't try to sublease for $50/month. That's just rude. If the place is super nice, pay for it. Don't be a cheapskate. * Take pictures when you move in and when you move out. You shouldn't be expected to leave the apartment any cleaner than when you moved in. * Make sure you know move in date, move out date and TIME. And the processes for turning in keys and such. * Places to look: Housing Facebook Page for UIUC. Craigslist. (Reddit?) Those are the main two places, there are lots of other places online you could check if you don't find anything; but usually people who post there have also posted on craigslist and facebook. * The 22 Illini buses run a limited route during the summer, and don't make it over to first street, so keep that in mind when you choose a place over there. They also don't run late at night so don't go for One North or South if you won't like being so far away (sorry onenorth/south) If there's anything else, just let me know and I'll add it.

The policy was intended to provide students with easy access to printing so that they could accomplish their academic work. The cost of this policy has been accelerating, reaching approximately $250,000 per year across the college and incurs cost on printed pages that are not picked up and for upkeep. After evaluating the cost, the need for a unified and standardized campus approach to printing, the decreasing need for paper printing, the need for advanced computer-based tools, and the environmental responsibility we have as a higher education community, the College of Engineering has decided to end the current free printing policy, starting Fall 2017 semester.\" <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this for complaining about Peoria Charter, but has anyone ever been assessed a $15 transfer fee (rather than the normal $10) because they changed the return ticket time? The person on the phone told me that since I bought a round trip ticket that I forfeit my discount and have to pay an extra $5 which really makes absolutely no sense to me...

The thing is, finding housing from halfway around the world is a bit tricky. I have looked at craigslist but craigslist has it`s horror stories regarding housing.  I am therefore turning to reddit in hopes of finding an apartment to share.  PM me if you are interested in sharing an apartment with a swede, it would be awesome.  <eos> \n",

That said, nothing short of an archangel commanding me to birth the messiah under the penalty of eternal damnation would reverse my decision. Any students have experience with the process of getting one here in the CU area? Looking for comments on waiting period, cost after insurance coverage, possible concealment, etc. I'd like to keep it from my parents who aren't even aware that I'm sexually active if that's possible (kinda sad, but I don't want to be disinherited).  <eos> \n",

Because of budgetary constraints, the [Department of Public Works]([url link] cannot be as proactive as it wishes to be, but it will respond to citizen reports dialed in to 217-403-7070 and sent in to neighborhoodservices@ci.champaign.il.us. However, the city manager told me that the best way to report infrastructure issues around town is with a mobile application called [SeeClickFix]([url link] (It is available for [iOS]([url link] [Android]([url link] [Windows Phone]([url link] and [Blackberry]([url link] She also asked that I share the links to the city's [Facebook]([url link] and [Twitter]([url link] pages.

Dont sit at a public computer in the library coughing half assedly into your hand (and all over the keyboard) every 5 seconds. If you insist on doing so, the least you can do is wear a mask like lots of the international students do. I don't know how or where this behaviour became acceptable <eos> \n",

I want it to be a somewhat nice place, preferably somewhere where I can sometimes go by to visit. I was struggling to think of a place on my own around this campus where I can just dig up a hole in the ground without it getting me in trouble. Obviously, it's a very tiny box, so it's not going to be some massive thing. I was just wondering if anyone has any good ideas, or spots that I'd be able to bury him? <eos> \n",

I want to add gain intensive programming experience which isn't provided by the courses I am taking. I have taken online version of CS 225 and have knowledge of probability  statistics. I am confused whether CS 446 would be to difficult to be taken up my first semester here, hence should I stick to CS 440? Also, I haven't found description of Prof Koyejo version of CS 446 as compared to spring version with Prof Dan Roth on the forum. Any insights would be helpful! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello. I have come to the realization that my academic writing is bland and formulaic, so I will need to improve it. I am an econ major trying to get into grad school, so the stuff that's written about most there is pure economic theory, econometric analysis, and mathematical econ theory. As far as I know, there are no econ classes that really focus on academic writing, in fact writing papers here are extremely rare and there are no drafts or feedback involved. Are there any courses in the English or humanities departments which can help me with academic writing? What do you guys recommend? <eos> \n",

As I continue to meet students, professionals and recruiters from around the country it seems to me that we are in the same boat as MSU especially the colleges outside of engineering. Even our business school which is considerably our second strongest college is in the same bracket as MSU not UMich, Stern, Wharton USC and the other top undergrad business schools. Why is it like this? And is there anything the school or us as a student body can do to one day gain the prestige of UMich?  edit: grammar. Thanks for all the responses, really good insight.  <eos> \n",

I spend hours trying to understand the concepts and redoing problems and even with a cheat sheet and feeling confidence, I failed my first 408 midterm. If you don't do too hot in Calc 1 and/or Calc 2, don't fucking pursue a math major. Calc 3 and beyond will only get worse if you don't master the core concepts.  <eos> \n",

I had originally planned to go for the M.S. to obtain more research experience and set myself up for a career in RD and specifically research on bio-inspired materials. Prior to getting this email, my plan was to take a semester off for work and then look to come back in the spring for the M.S.  Is anyone on here currently (or previously) enrolled in the Meng program and can shed some light on this degree's pros/cons vs. the M.S.? I'm not opposed to following a different career path, but I am skeptical about the value of this degree, given that no research is involved and no funding is available through the university (not an issue for me).  <eos> \n",

I think it's relevant because I first heard about Spicy Tang from a thread in this sub, so there may be others who are interested. I visited Spicy Tang and had a negative experience, which I described in considerable detail in a 1-star review on their [Yelp page]([url link] My Yelp name is Bo D. and my review is no longer counted in the score since it is no longer recommended; you can still view it by clicking \"other reviews not currently recommended\" near the bottom. This happened because a few days afterwards, I noticed 3 new 5-star reviews written within an hour of one another. All three accounts are by users with no other restaurant reviews. They have some Yelp friends to help them appear legitimate, but you'll see that none of the friends have any reviews either (furthermore, these three accounts are friends with one another). I thought they were pretty obviously shill accounts so I called them out publicly and flagged their reviews for removal. Yelp instead decided to hide mine and keep the shill reviews, even though my review received several Useful/Funny/Cool votes. My problem with this place isn't just the mediocre food or disorganized service at the restaurant; those are subjective opinions and others may enjoy the place much more than I did. What bothers me is the unethical practice of putting up fake reviews to deceive people. I'm not asking anyone to boycott this establishment (visit them and judge for yourself), but I do think this might be useful information for some people. Cheers! <eos> \n",

So, you drive down Stoughton Rd., between Harvey and Lincoln and it's like 6:30 in the morning so you have the entire fucking south-side of the street to park on. So you pull up to the sign that says \"No parking here to corner\", and I swear to god you must put your blinkers on, step out of the car, and take out measuring tape to figure out the exact distance you need to park away from that sign such that nobody can park behind you... you fucking prick.   Or, that time I saw you drive up to a stretch of shoulder that could fit 2 fucking Panzer IVs between the cars that are already parked there. So, you bring out your fucking Lidar to determine the exact midpoint of the available space, and carefully assure the midpoint of your car is coincident.  Or maybe you just own a fuckin 4-door crew-cab F-350, in which case, fuck you by default.  Either way, I see you...and I'm writing down license plate numbers... and when I see your vehicle parked alone on a dark winter night, I'm gonna slightly move your driver side mirror just enough to annoy you, but not so much that you know that anyone did it.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey UIUC. Currently an incoming Sophomore that's freaking out about his major.  I'm currently in ABE (Ag and Bio Engineering). I hear mixed things about the major that I wish I had heard before accepting this position at UIUC. I really enjoyed my professors in ABE the last two semesters, but I'm worried it's not as marketable as I once thought. Normally I would talk to some upperclassmen about their feelings for ABE, and talk to my adviser about all of this information... but we're in the middle of the summer.  So I suppose what I'm asking is for any personal information regarding ABE any of you have, both positive and negative. I really just want a true representation of the major itself, and if I'm correct in wanting to switch to Chemical Engineering. AND, if that's the course of action I'm taking, is there anyone available currently at the university I can contact about this information? I'm not even sure if my adviser is available during summer hours.  I really hope I haven't made a pretty grievous mistake in regards to my major, since I believe transferring might be hard since I'm just around the 3.1 GPA requirement for transferring into ChemE. I'm overall pretty flustered and just looking for clarification to a lot. Thanks a ton! <eos> \n",

I got an A, B, and B-, but the D, really fucked me, and now my GPA is 2.5. Advice, I know there is grade replacement but honestly something motivational or advice on how to study at this place would be welcome? I'm pretty low in the dumps. I don't even want to tell my parents because I was a pretty good student in high school I know I could of done better but I didn't focus on the right things my first semester here.

            "<bos> I was hoping to get a double suite with three other girls in north newman. I'm just curious to hear opinions on how strict it was there, how the rooms were, and how easy it was to meet people who were more on the 'liberal/going out to parties and such' type. I just wanted a nicer place to live, but did *not* want to stay in uni housing another year (staying in par now).  Most of all, is it worth the cost? The cheapest option is 12,800 for 14 meals. Does anyone know how this compares to apartment life?  Thanks for any info!!  *Edit: Wow thanks so much guys-- I would really love an apartment but it's a bit difficult for me to find people to live with, however it sounds like a muuch better option. Maybe I'll look for an efficiency kinda thing for one person? Anyway thanks for the info!*  <eos> \n",

This is theoretically an academic integrity offence, and I've heard that a few people have ended up with those registration holds where you have to make all changes on paper.  Leave before we catch you. We're also scanning for folks in CS 173 or 374 without the prerequisites.  If that's you, and you don't have equivalent background that you can tell us about, you should drop the course before we have you removed.   In a normal world, we might let you stay in the class until you realized you were in over your head.  But with the classes so full, you're preventing someone with the intended background from taking the course. <eos> \n",

I think the professor is generally a good guy i like him as a scientist in a way, and he has alot of knowledge. the issue is i think he expects wayyy too much out of us, the math is pretty complex. we went over in extreme depth the virial theorem and stellar nuclear chem. also i think its shitty how there is no material to review, only the homework which we already did and the lecture notes which are not always helpful.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Is it just me or is the CBTF getting stricter? A couple years ago they just warned not to take in electronics or to leave them in your bag/silence them. At the beginning of this year they wanted you to put them in the holders on the desk, which made me nervous. No one was watching the phones and it would be pretty easy to pick up someone else's without a problem. They never gave a way to mark them as a certain person's which worried me. Now they ask to see your phone, which make me more nervous because I don't always have my phone on me. Also the \"let me see your phone\" freaks me out. I'm an anxious person in general and have always had worse anxiety at the CBTF with the proctors standing over my shoulder for a good 5 minutes staring at me, but now I just dread going in. I half expect there to be metal detectors and pat downs if they don't believe you don't have your phone on you. Some proctors have been nicer about it though and more gentle with asking about phones which I appreciate. <eos> \n",

I've wanted to join some RSOs, but I tend to sign up for a bunch and then never go. Is there any information I can get so I can contact the right people to get the necessary information for first meetings? Primarily, I wanted to join the BMES club, and a volunteer RSO or some club that can help me expand my interests, and network/meet new people/make some friends. Any recommendations?

            "<bos> I'm an exchange student and I have a question about academic integrity here at UIUC. Let's say that you have a homework problem to prove a statement in a math course. You try hard for a long time and you are still stuck. You type in some key words into google and come across a full solution. a) Would it be plagiarism to use ideas from the solution to write your own solution in your own words? b) Would it be plagiarism to use the solution (but rewrite it in your own words)?  Do people do this a lot with homework here? In my home university the final exams determine the entire grade so I've never faced this issue before.   <eos> \n",

The I-Link email says that if there are any spots left after invited candidates sign up, I may sign up. There were like five spots left (I got the email at 8:00 AM on a Sunday and immediately checked), so of course I signed up. I am worried about the \"alternate\" title though. Does that mean I am automatically a second-choice candidate from here on out? Do I have the same chances as an originally invited candidate? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Sorry about another CS post.  I feel like the Labs/MPs for 241 are swallowing up all of my energy, all for very little return. I mean, I'm learning a lot from lecture, the wikibook and even from doing the coding assignments, but I am having trouble actually finishing the assignments on time because I feel like each one is so time consuming and by the time I start the next one its just a little too late because I was working on the previous one.  Last week I used one of the \"freebies\" for the MP regrade at the end of the semester because I hadn't started the MP in time to finish. I figured I'd use the opportunity to get ahead on these assignments, but I worked on this shell MP for a good 12+ hours over the weekend, and I got a lot done, but I'm still not really sure if I can finish it by tonight.  I know the typical response is \"start early\" (which I'm currently working on trying to do) and \"ask questions\", but I feel like the responses are usually all the same from the TA's, pretty much along the lines of \"you can figure it out\". To be honest, I usually can figure it out with some googling.  Right now my process is just to map all of my ideas on a whiteboard before coding, then slowly turn it into C code, debugging as I go along. It takes a really long time, but for the most part it feels like I am doing things in a well thought out way. I guess the worst feeling with this MP was feeling like I had a solid handle on what I was doing, and then I had to change so much just to implement the logical operators. I just feel like I can't catch a break, and it is starting to affect my wellbeing and my other classes. I guess my question is, does anyone have a good process for doing these MP's and labs in a more timely fashion? Any advice is greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> PSA this is a vent post. So CS 210 was supposed to teach us ethics, but then the professor also offhandedly said that the main aim is to make sure we can write professional emails. Okay... It certainly seemed that way with the weekly writing assignments which would have been fun if not for the peer review system which encouraged students to check off items from the prompt rather than construct passionate, meaningful essays. The peer review system also encouraged grade inflation, with students taking off points only if someone missed something on the prompt, while not providing any meaningful feedback.  This was pretty obvious for the final presentations. I tried to be conscientious and give a mix of As and Bs (and trust me not all speakers were even prepared well). Turns out my grading accuracy was 52%. When I gave mostly As on the essays my accuracy was above 90%. Also funny incident that left a sour taste in my mouth - One lecture we learn that nerd culture has been partly responsible for the lower proportion of females in CS. Next lecture we are served up some top kek Overwatch jokes.  Meanwhile the professor seems vaguely passive aggressive on Piazza. He even called out an anon poster by name because he was pissed at him. Also what's up with the exclusively female, exclusively humanities course staff? I mean sure it's a legit possibility that all top qualified candidates were females studying humanities but the pretentiousness of the course makes me think it's some sort of social experiment/whatever by the professor. Edit: Oh and the exams were a joke but I'm not complaining about an easy A. <eos> \n",

Which would you decide to go to between the two? I'd prefer some where with good amount of things to do, diversity of people and things, relatively cheap but good food, ability to travel at decent to cheap prices, etc. I can't decide between the two, and the deadline is soon approaching. Please help...thanks! <eos> \n",

I had him for 2 semesters already (I retook 102) and I really don't want to deal with him again (his teaching style and exams are a pain). Ray is teaching the online class, but I'm wondering if having an online course will be as beneficial as an in-person lecture (I'm afraid of slacking off, having no office hours, etc.). For anyone who has taken it online, what are the pros/cons, workload, grading, etc.?  <eos> \n",

This semester's tournament will be held on March 9th and March 10th and is open to any (and only) UIUC student regardless of rank or playstyle. If you would like to participate please fill out this google form: [url link] (the phone number is just in case we can't get a hold of you for some reason, we get a lot of these cases...). If you CANNOT make both days of the tournament please DO NOT sign up! If you would not like to play but are interested in helping cast, doing production, or being a subtitute player for the tournament please PM me, we need as much help as we can get to make sure the tournament runs smoothly! We will also have a meeting in the Union basement on March 9th to give out some goodies and for me to collect the buy-in money. This tournament follows competitive rulings and I will be choosing the most capable players out of the pool to be captains of each team. The captains will conduct a draft to form their teams a few days before the tournament to make sure the teams are fair and balanced. There is a $5 buy-in for this tournament and captains will be responsible for collecting the money. Second place will be getting their money back in prizing with first place getting the rest of the prize pool. In addition to this the winners will receive any excess goodies we may receive between now and the tournament.  If you have any questions please feel free to PM me. I will be posting updates and paying more attention to the Illini Esports discord ([url link] <eos> \n",

Two notes: - students are recommended to work up to 20h but can work up to 28h without showing up on anybodies radar - hours are counted biweekly, so if you work 0 hours one week and 56 hours the other week in the same pay period, you're in the clear - multiple infractions means you'll be terminated. I have no idea if this will actually happen, but my gut feeling is that it's unlikely. <eos> \n",

I had come up with a naive way to achieve what I wanted, but it was under performing as compared to the simplest version of the model. So if it was doing poorly, I wanted to at least put a lower bound on how bad it would do at worst, which involved taking the expectation of this really complicated recursive formula (details [here]([url link]  I tried (unsuccessfully) posing the question to /r/math and the mathematics stackoverflow network. I was about to give up and just move on when I remembered where I was. Turns out, Professor Hajek (of ECE313 fame) has literally written the book on random processes like the one I was dealing with. I ended up dropping by his office unannounced last week and described the problem to him. Not only was he able to answer my original question, he even suggested a slight tweak to my generation process (using something I'd never heard of called the \"reflection principle\") to increase the expectation of the process, like I wanted all along. To him, it was probably some trivial application of a long forgotten theorem from his undergrad, but to me, it was the solution to a problem that had been on my mind for weeks.  I just find it to be incredible how accessible these people are. It's really quite an amazing privilege we have to be able to go to school in such an awesome place. <eos> \n",

My initial impression is that it's just a CA fumbling around for 50 min while we do practice problems. Since all the problems and answers are posted online, and we have a Piazza to ask questions on, are there any benefits to showing up to discussion?

It's more an issue with the format of the discussion, and whether I should motivate myself to attend or to make do otherwise.  <eos> \n",

Anyways, before I make the official facebook group, I wanted to decide exactly where I'll be screen-printing the shirts.  Does anybody have a suggestion as to the best place to Screen-print on campus (or perhaps online)? I've dealt with Weiskamp before and have had good experiences, but I've never really branched out. The design is two ink colors on front and back, and I'm hoping to order at least 50 if not a lot more. Any suggestions are appreciated! Design coming soon! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I can't' seem to find consensus in the internet world on this course. I recently signed up to take Calc I (as a non-degree seeking student, so I can freshen up for a grad program). When I took Calc I in college several years ago, I enjoyed it and the principles/theorems/logic was emphasized in teaching. However, NetMath, using the Mathematica software, is horrible. Not only does it overlook the basic logic behind all of the principles, but no lessons on the basic principles of calculus are available. No recorded lectures, no notes, nothing but the coded examples (and no side notes explaining the examples either). My mentor offers case-by-case assistance only after the homework is submitted, and none of the big-picture ideas are ever addressed in feedback, because the homework is mainly centered around coding correctly. Wolfram's coding reference online does very little because it is designed to simply understand the software, with no relation to which class/formulas in use. Frankly, this experience so far has been extremely frustrating, and I am about to drop the class in favor of one which teaches the course itself (including the logic behind what we do in calculus). I've spent far too much of my time learning a coding language which I did not sign up to learn. As I prepare for entering graduate school in economics, I feel as though this class will dangerously underprepare me for advanced economics. I'm beyond frustrated that I would have spent over $2000 on a course which offers no valid teaching materials - I've asked where I might find this and was simply instructed to 'go online and Google it' essentially. WTF is this, and has anyone else felt the same or am I missing something? TL; DR Netmath/Mathematica is a joke, I'm not learning Calc and I don't have time to learn code. I feel like I've been duped into thinking this was a Calculus course, in which someone teaches me Calculus... what am I missing here? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Freshman here. ECE120 has been fking me so hard recently, that it is now the sole proprietor of my virginity. All jokes aside, I'm in serious need of advice! I've been falling behind dramatically. I've gotten &lt;50% on the past three homework assignments because I plain out had no idea where to even begin or start a problem. I scored in the bottom 20% on the first midterm. (70/100) when i thought i made an A. The only good thing going for me is the labs. I've managed to score nearly 100% on all of them, and I have a lot of fun doing the labs because of how interesting it is. My professor has the thickest Indian accent my ears have ever acknowledged. He doesn't seem to have a lot of passion when teaching the class and covers all the lecture slides for the week in just 50 minutes. All i'm shooting for is a C- at this point, but I don't even know if I can secure that! Please send help ;( <eos> \n",

So, I went and signed into my portal to pay online but the amount current due is only the sanitation fee. How are we suppose to pay the initial fee? Also, all the fees like rent are given in terms of the whole appartment but of course my roommates will be splitting the charge. How does that work then? Like, will the number on my portal that is due for rent change after one of my roommates submit his or her end? Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, I am just very confused with the whole online payment side of this. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm going to be a freshman CS major this coming fall, and I had a couple of questions: 1. What programming languages are typically used in the CS classes? Also, do classes tend to be only theoretical at first, or can I expect to have actual coding assignments my first year? 2. What non-CS classes do students usually end up taking their first year (such as Physics)?  3. How hard is it to land a paid CS-related (such as coding?) internship during the summer after freshman year? I'm pretty motivated and willing to work my ass off to obtain the skills that an internship would require. Is it really uncommon for a freshman to get an internship? I've tried my hand at a couple of languages over the years, but I haven't really \"excelled\" at one, so I sort of want to spend summer to really get a sort of headstart for college classes, as well as work on the skills I'll need to hopefully land an internship! Answers, thoughts, and opinions greatly apprecated! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Can an engineering student withdraw from the school other than medical reasons? Has anyone withdrew? If so, what happened? (Well, I went to an advisor days ago and he was going like: \"well, we are not going to allow withdrawal unless very horrible circumstances. And if you withdraw, we only allow two-semester withdrawal.\" That is why I am asking here. Because I find it conflicting with the information I saw...) <eos> \n",

You've probably seen signs for it if you've walked past there. - Inclusive to all; people that go there are a mix of students and community members. - Good food, and they have an email list so if you sign up they'll tell you what the meal is each week. - Religiousness: generally the person running this says a grace before the meal, but otherwise it is not religious at all. If you're interested you can volunteer there as well. <eos> \n",

The problem is, by the time I walk to the building of my next class and get out my stuff to do work, I only have about 45 minutes in which it can be hard to get in the zone and get much done.

            "<bos> My roomate got this email earlier today: Hello Passengers, Well, this has never happened before. The driver of the northbound trip that becomes your southbound trip had a very unusual situation on his bus, and it is delaying his southbound trip. It seems that a passenger told the driver he was having a heart attack and he wanted the bus to stop and get him medical attention. When the driver stopped to help the man, he insisted on getting out to get some air. Shortly after he exited the bus, he removed all of his clothing and ran away, naked, down the side of the road. Law enforcement has asked the driver to stick around for a bit to help complete an incident report. We estimate that the bus will depart Woodfield and Oakbrook about an hour late. Please stick around the loading area so that you don't miss the bus when it does arrive. We will send additional updates as information becomes available. If you are sitting in a car at Woodfield, please tell the people around you, ie people sitting in cars who may not be checking email. Best Wishes, Suburban Express  Throwaway to protect myself from retribution. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I apologize for bothering you during your unofficial. I want to thank you in advance for any answers provided!  So, I've been accepted for Computer Engineering at UIUC, GT and Purdue. Overall, UIUC would have the highest cost at $27,000. Whereas GT and Purdue would end up at around $20,000-$22,000. Are there any specific benefits of UIUC in contrast to the others? Specifically career fairs, internships and co-ops as an undergrad. I plan to get a MS degree as well, if that's of any help.  Another question I have is how hard is it to find a part-time job on campus as a freshman at UIUC?  Edit: To clarify - CE as in computer Engineering  <eos> \n",

An information link has been enclosed for your information. If you believe you may have mumps: we encourage you to seek medical care at McKinley Health Center.  Please forward the information below to your students…  [url link]  As you know, the single best way to prevent spread of infectious illness is to wash your hands.  Since mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, persons may prevent contracting mumps with a few simple actions:  • Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and throw the tissue away after use.  • Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. If water is not near, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.  • Do not share eating and/or drinking utensils.  • Refrain from close contact with individuals who are sick/experiencing symptoms.  • Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. (Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.)  Thank you. Stay healthy guys! EDIT: Formatting <eos> \n",

            "<bos> The University Committee on the student code has quietly made some sizable changes to your student rights. The committee erased the rule which provides you with a method of transferring sections if you cannot understand your TA's English. In place of this rule, the committee created a new \"blanket protection of student rights\" rule which they insisted would solve the same problems as the rule they erased. Sadly, this rule is not only vague as to what \"student rights\" are, it provides no protection for them at all, just the assurance that you can talk to your professor about your concerns.     \"§1-102(e): Should a student feel that his or her rights as a student have been violated, the student may  discuss the matter with his or her instructor in the relevant course to the extent possible. If a resolution  cannot be reached, the student may contact the head of the department in which the course is being  offered.  If further assistance is needed, the student may contact the Dean’s Office of the college offering  the course. Assistance navigating the process is available through the Student Assistance Center in the  Dean of Students Office at 217-333- 0050 or helpdean@illinois.edu Monday-Friday between the hours of  8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.\" Now, if this wasn't bad enough, I emailed the leaders of the committee, Sara Benson and Dean Ballom, to get it in writing that this new rule would apply to cases where students can't understand their TA **as promised in the meetings**. Both of them refused to put this in writing. If we don't get it in writing that being unable to understand your TA falls under the new rule, the administration will not let students use this to transfer sections.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Who among us would be interested in the following evening out? Dinner at Destihl or Merry Anne's in Champaign, followed by some \"Unskilled Chess Fun\" at The Blind Pig. At 10PM whoever is up for it can go to the Art to see \"John Carpenter's The Thing\"-an awesome scary movie. This lets out around midnight, which may give us time to catch a midnight show of the new \"The Thing\" opening Friday at Savoy or Carmike. Any one who can only do some or one of these that wants to meet up, I think this could be a lot of fun. Say meet for dinner around 5:30PM, then head over to the Blind Pig about 7PM, that leaves plenty of time for unskilled chess play, then the movie at the Art is at 10PM. I'll post the new \"The Thing\" movie times on Friday when they come out. If people need a ride from campus, I can take a few people in my car. PM me for my cell number so we can coordinate better on Friday. EDIT:more details EDIT 2: Let's say 5:45 at Merry Anne's next to Exile on Main Street for dinner, then after dinner we'll head to the Blind Pig on Neil for Unskilled Chess (I'll bring an extra board/pieces in case a significant number of players show up) before 'The Thing' at 10PM at the Art. Looking forward to seeing you there!  EDIT 3: I believe there is a midnight show of the new \"The Thing\" on Friday/Saturday at The Carmike. Anyone who wants to make it a double feature, I will probably be up for it <eos> \n",

If you've signed the contract for now because you're not sure you may be getting an apartment for next year, know that now you have only **30 DAYS to cancel your contract** after you've signed--not until about mid-April like before.  To quote: \"Cancellations after 30 days will result in a settlement fee of up to 75% of your room and board costs for the contract year. See the Contract, section 11 (pdf), for cancellation rules and deadlines.\" If you signed the contract, you can find this info on the message you received shortly after doing so. Just a heads up bc that can be a lot of $$$.  TLDR; You now only have a 30-day period to cancel your university housing contract after you've signed before you may have to pay up to 75% of the costs. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I failed my ECE 120 Final when the average was a solid 75. I will definitely end up with a solid C. Just learned that I got a B- in PHYS 211. I'm probably getting a B in Calc III. Last semester I had a 2.71 GPA. I do not think I am dumb. I do think EE is interesting, and I think my passion is there but my grades are really in the dumps and I can't help but feel like engineering is not right for me. My ECE friends are all managing a 3.2-3.7 GPA and I am really mad at myself for not even managing a 3.0. I'm so embarrassed that I didn't even put my GPA on my resume. I do have another major in mind but... Should I stick it through? Or is the field too competitive and I won't really make it any where? Can I still make it back up to the 3.2 range? Freshman year is already over and it's only gonna get harder... If you can give me any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you fellow redditors. Edit: Thank you guys for being realistic and giving a lot of things to think about. I definitely want to to stick it out! I'll study much harder at the expense of part of my social life (and sleep), but it'll be worth it in the long run. You're all wonderful people, and I wish you guys much success and happiness in the future. :) And sorry if this post was redundant, I didn't search through this subreddit. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, I am a Civil and Environmental Engineering grad student who is trying to do a research project that uses arduino to collect data using sensor, store it in SD card (in CSV format), transfer it to another arduino (or raspberry pi) and finally upload it to some website. I have made a sample arduino which does the part upto storing it in SD card. However, transferring it to another device seems to be a bit more complicated for my little knowledge about programming and electronics. I could send some data using 433 MHz RF module but there was a lot of noise. Using any device (Xbee or nrf24l01 or any other RF module) is alright till the data is transferred. If anyone has previous experience with these devices and can help me in this project with wireless data transmission and uploading to website, please feel free to contact me. Any help will be highly appreciated.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

If you wished 'Hunger Games' was more violent and insane, this is the movie for you!

Don't really have any requirements for a roommate. I would prefer a grad student. I'm an engineering grad student so would also be cool to find non-STEM grad students, but it really doesn't matter to me. I also prefer to live in Urbana because I like the area more and better chances of having a house instead of an apartment. NOTE: I may not be in school for Spring 2019, however, I will try to find a sublease if I end up doing a co-op or something. If I can't find a sublease I'll still be paying rent at the place and periodically coming back to town.  PM me if you wanna talk more! ~~EDIT: Found out from the landlord that the current house I'm living in is still up for rent. It's a dope place with 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I have a projector and gaming PC set up in the living room with a large driveway and 2 parking spots in the backyard with free street parking in the front. Has a basement for storage, a porch and a netted backyard florida room.~~ EDIT: Spring 2019* ~~EDIT: Didn't mention but we convinced VOLO to install a fiber line specially to our house so for somewhere around $60-$70 so it's about *600 mbps down, 550 mbps up* (I care about good internet!)~~ EDIT: My place is already taken.

            "<bos> Hey /r/UIUC, Just wanted to let you know about a group on campus being created called Open Ears.  I’m sure no one here is a stranger to college struggles, whether it be test anxiety, having no one you feel you can really talk to, struggling to get by in classes when it seems everyone else is doing just fine, finding you need to shut out your own thoughts to even make it through the day, or so much more. We’ve all dealt with problems in one way or another. Open Ears is here to give students a place they can talk about those problems, with people who will always want to help. Many of us in the group right now have been through hard times, and having each other to talk to helped/helps. If you ever need someone to listen to what you're going through or help you through it, all of us are here to help. We also want to raise awareness for mental health issues and depression. People deal with these things on a daily basis and supporting people with these problems can make a difference. We are hoping by raising awareness about the issues and through that lessen the stigma associated with getting help.  Anyways, if you’re interested in helping out, want more information, or just want someone to talk to shoot us an email at OpenEarsUIUC@gmail.com. We also have a facebook page at [url link] Feel free to PM me or comment with any questions as well! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Being a new student I want to support some of the sport teams and I hope to attend a couple of home football games this year. They seem to only offer Student Football Season tickets. Now I'm not gonna deny it, $77 for the entire season of home games is a good deal. But I do not plan to attend every game, and frankly they aren't that great enough to warrant my attendance to all of their home games. Are there student tickets for individual games? Or am I stuck buying regular single tickets? <eos> \n",

But I could not find a magic trick club in our campus currently. If anyone plays magic tricks, or interested in playing magic tricks, I think we can play and practice together. Plz reply me if u r interested, NEED FRIENDS SO BAD <eos> \n",

Pretty awesome that we were included in that tour, especially with two shows. Also found this recording and picture. Listen to at least the first minute of the recording. Mick Jagger's intro is hilarious and shows just how much Champaign's reputation has changed in the past 43 years. [Recording]([url link] [Picture]([url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This past weekend, a few friends from out of town and I were waiting about an hour outside of Black Dog for a table. In the window was a flyer for Pandamonium Doughnuts. Since I have a penchant for waiting in line for food, I thought \"Why the hell not?\" In its current form, the store is a \"pop-up\" shop that is open on the weekends:  Friday 5pm till sold out Saturday 8am - sold out Sunday 10 am - sold out However, there are only a few weekends the shop will be up:  March 21-23rd March 28-30th April 4-6th The shop is located in Downtown Urbana (206 W. Main St.). And as you can see from this picture, it was [quite the wait early that morning]( [url link] Apparently, the word is getting out.  Nonetheless, I was blown away by the flavor and quality of the doughnuts. My girlfriend and I picked up half a dozen doughnuts:  2 X Maple Bacon Apple Fritters 1 X Vanilla Bean 1 X Blueberry Lemon 1 X Carrot Cake 1 X Breakfast Snack (Fruity Cereal?)  We shared a bite of each and were just blown away. One small downside, however, was the price. For a half dozen doughnuts, we paid $13. That's not in everybody's budget, but you do get what you pay for. By definition, they are \"gourmet doughnuts\" and they certainly taste that way. I highly recommend checking these out, and they may be the best doughnuts you've ever eaten.  Keep an eye out this summer, there should be a food truck as early as May in the C-U area.  Disclaimer: I'm not in any way affiliated with Pandamonium Doughnuts. I'm just a guy that likes good food.  Edit: Here's one [article]([url link] <eos> \n",

So I was planning to major in English, but I've decided that I really want to go into recreation, sport and tourism instead. I know that they're in different colleges, so I'm just wondering how difficult it would be to switch over. If someone could give me a brief overview of the process of switching, that would be amazing too. Sorry, I know it might be a silly question, so thank you for bearing with me. <eos> \n",

Like if I wanted to watch CS 374 lectures from this semester next year or CS 225 lectures from two years ago, is there a way to access those recordings or are they deleted every semester?  Also, is it possible to access those recordings after you've graduated? Thanks in advance and congratulations to everybody that graduated this semester!  <eos> \n",

I'll be at UIUC for a conference in late June (ISMS...anyone else going?) and I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to get back to Madison on Monday night. My research group is driving down there together (and back on Friday) but I'll be TAing this summer and don't want to miss an entire week of class.  Anyways, I was wondering if you guys knew of any buses that go between UIUC and Madison. I can get Megabus from Chicago, but I'd have to get to Chicago first...

So we're shopping around for internet since the un-bundled Comcast internet is a bit more. Does anyone use U-verse around here? We're getting 24 mbps roughly with our current setup, but are there any alternatives that we can get that will be cheaper? TL;DR What's the best internet here for houses/apartments? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Ur boy was recently just admitted by engineering physics but has a few questions. I just chose this major cause I liked engineering and physics and didn't really put much thought into it. But now I have a few questions... 1. How is the coursework? Is it more engineering or physics focused? Is it really hard? I have always been good with math but still relatively concerned. 2. How are job prospects after graduation? This is more for people who have already finished the program, but is it easy to find jobs after graduation? Make lots of $$?? 3. How hard to transfer into other majors, like computer science? Not sure if I really want to cause I don't really have any background experience in computer science, but I want to have some relative freedom b/c i don't know what I want to do in the future. 4. How prominent is racism on campus? Not related to the major, but in recently light of Suburban Express, that has sort of turned me down from going to UIUC. I have faced lots of racism in the past as an Asian American growing up without almost no other Asians at my school, so I have thicker skin than most others. But I have heard many times that \"there are too many Asians at UIUC\" and don't want to feel unwelcomed. Thanks, any response would be appreciated. <eos> \n",

Those scammers who demand your Ameren bill for 'discounts' or 'rebates' were knocking on my door again. This time I just slammed the door when they mentioned Ameren (The girl who tried to scam me was cute though :D).  Anyways residents beware. No one in the world is kind enough to knock on your doors to let you know you can get money back. <eos> \n",

Seems difficult to find anything from the last couple of years. Are suicide statistics available to the public somewhere?

ECE advising doesn't recommend taking it due to the difficulty of the course and I'm wondering how hard it actually is.

We're still working with WebStore to get their offered version of FastX updated, but links from [this page]([url link] can help you download the new version. When setting up, though, there's something to keep in mind: Due to the way the Mac OS handles SSH keys and DNS lookups, you will need to use a different host address for the FastX server. The \"Host\" should be: fastx-mac.ews.illinois.edu Hopefully that will be helpful to some of you that have had trouble. -EngrIT <eos> \n",

Over the past few weeks, I have been feeling pretty drained, lonely and burned out, and am looking for external motivation. I have been isolating myself and been depriving myself of a lot sleep for a while, to keep up with the mountain of work these three and other classes have been assigning. I thought it would be nice to crank through the material with a bunch of people. Please PM me if you're interested, or comment if you have any suggestions :) <eos> \n",

            "<bos> \"if you hadn't seen this yet: [url link] \" Here's my 2 cents... I object to objectifying instructors, TAs, faculty, student mentors, staff and other people in a power-relationship with students. The original reddit post and discussion might be seen as harmless especially as it is directed at male faculty. Unfortunately I suggest it normalizes objectifying and stalking behavior and also takes us a step away from being a fun-but-professional-and-nurturing-environment for all. I imagine some CS students will disagree with the first point - that it was just harmless fun on reddit - and claim that I am over-reacting. However, it's not true (e.g. I read it) and besides I'd be more interested in greater and nuanced point of view from a broader community. By the way, it has secondary effects: For example, I am thinking it's probably just a troll but what if I have a stalker? Stalkers can do unpredictable things (e.g. falsely claim they were inappropriately harassed or worse) - because they are not getting sufficient 1-on-1 attention they desire from their target. Though I believe it was likely a troll I'm now concerned about advising CS students. e.g. I should probably keep door open during advising and be less approachable. Which ultimately means it's harder for a student to discuss their concerns. My first reaction is \"don't feed the trolls\" and / or \"don't feed the stalker\" i.e ignore it but I don't want to be complicit in supporting this kind of atmosphere.  I would rather we have discussion about the atmosphere and environment that we want to work towards at Computer Science @ UIUC - both online and face-to-face. I doubt such a serious nuanced discussion is possible on /r/uiuc but I'd be happy to be proved wrong. <eos> \n",

How often do you guys travel to the location for your projects(in particular, I am interested in Ecuador or the Guatemala project)? Is it mostly planned at UIUC, then implemented by a few. 2. As a computer science major, I was wondering if there are any ways that coding can help you guys - since I know that most projects will be tailored towards electrical, agricultural, and mechanical engineering just by nature.

What I am trying to do is, burn a CD with the ISO file provided and type in the license key given when I install the OS. Is this correct? Also, I'm not sure if that is the right product. The name of the product is \"Microsoft Windows 10 Education Upgrade for U of I Students License  Download - Campus Agreement\". I'm kinda confused with the word \"Upgrade\". Does it mean that there has to be an OS installed in my PC or is it just a regular OS file that can be installed in a PC without an OS installed? Thanks in advance <eos> \n",

Had it stolen out of my back yard on the W 700 block of Illinois St. last night after 9 and before 9 this morning If you see it around or drunkenly borrowed it or something like that please let me know. I'd just like it back. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> There's a skinny white guy with dirty blonde hair who about 85-95% of the time is walking around on the third floor of grainger east side. Sometimes he is on his laptop but most of the time it just looks like he's just staring at me. For awhile I suspected that he was just a student that used grainger a lot like myself but at this point I'm convinced that he's stalking me. I've pulled two all-nighters at grainger and a few mornings where I arrive at 5AM. Every single time I've came at these weird hours he's walking on the third floor. At the end of the day I don't really care that the dude is stalking me at grainger but I just thought that it was kind of an interesting observation. I'm sure a lot of us have considered what it must be like to stalk someone but clearly this dude knows first hand lol Has anyone else noticed this library-stalker? <eos> \n",

I'm not a photography major or minor, but I do a ton of photography in my free time and really love it.

            "<bos> What the fuck. We also may want to consider Article 3-107 of the Code of Conduct at UIUC. edit: \"We are aware the the final exam was significantly longer and more difficult than the midterm exams. Final exam scores will be curved up if they are lower than expected. A decision about any curving will only be taken after we have all final exams completed and all scantrons processed, which will probably be around Monday or Tuesday next week (scantron processing is slower over finals week).\" <eos> \n",

            "<bos> When I had my oil changed at Walmart, they told that the wheels of my small car were out of alignment (and I notice that it will gradually veer to the left, rather than the right, if I take my hands off the wheel). I plan to have a couple new front tires put on my car at Walmart (they have a great price on these), and then taking the car somewhere to have its wheels aligned. Where can I get a good deal on quality wheel alignment in cu? Maybe I need to use a coupon or something? Thanks for any advice. <eos> \n",

Haven't spoken to most of my high school friends since graduation years ago, and have not replaced them in college # Domination and control Student loans mean I either graduate with a high-paying STEM degree, or I'm fucked as butts, so my only option at this point is to stick it out # Still feeling like they're the greatest, and no one else will ever love me Any other schools have a 3,000,000 pound crusher thingamajig, or the country's oldest experimental corn field? No? So fuck you Harvard and Stanford. But obviously I couldn't transfer even if I wanted to, due to the low GPA. <eos> \n",

My friend used to work in the English building at the desk in the tech lab, but I don't know how he got that position. [I can't ask bc we're not really friends rn]. Any places people would recommend working at or places I could find a job at on campus that isn't too time demanding? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Green Street Restaurant Manager here. How are you doing today?  I have jobs available. I advertise them in the DI, but nobody reads it so nobody sees them. I advertise them on Craigslist and I get the *wrong* kind of applicant.  I used to advertise on the Virtual Job Board @ UIUC. It worked great -- for students and for me! But they had some scam jobs on there and they shut it down. Is it just me, or is shutting the damn thing down an overreaction? Couldn't UIUC be a little more clever about solving the problem? Like what about having an application form for local businesses and verifying they are legit (ie have a place on campus) and accepting ads from the verified employers? That way, students could find out about decent jobs on campus and employers would have access to the student labor pool. To me, it seems like someone at UIUC was just lazy. Instead of being lazy, they need to try to fashion a solution that helps students in the best possible way. Any thoughts? <eos> \n",

I know it generally doesn't work when we ask for suggestions, but I have no idea how many people are on campus right now and what you guys would be interested in doing. I suggest beer pong, video games, sex/drugs/alcohol, or some combination of all the above.

Now I'm sociology and I HATE it. I'm gonna finish anyways though just to get a degree. Someone mentioned to me that I should graduate, work for a couple years, and then go back for a second degree. I would go back for chemistry. I'm assuming it wouldn't be another 4 years...? Does anyone have any knowledge of this type of thing.

            "<bos> Hello, I'm a physics major at UIUC starting in the fall of this year and I had a few questions regarding Trelease hall in FAR complex. How is the general environment there? Is it easy to study/sleep/get work done or is it too loud to do anything? Are there a lot of parties at FAR? Are the students who live there generally respectful? Are buses to Loomis Lab/Engineering Quad easy to get? Thanks for your help! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I took BADM 320 this summer and just logged on today to do my weekly homework and take the final, only to find that the homework due date got pushed forward three days and the final was due yesterday. The professor has never responded to any of my emails throughout the summer and has never responded to any questions in the class facebook group. Is there a way I can contact someone in the department who will actually answer me? Is there some way I can drop the class? It's not a class for my major, if that counts for anything. Panicking pretty badly and could use any sort of advice about this. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I got an email a couple days ago sending me to a check out proofs for graduation photos, and I figured I'd take a look to see if I wanted to order some. Now, instead of having a static 'shopped-in watermark like pretty much every other photographer ever, Memory Lane decided to put on this scrolling \"copyright\" thing that covers up a bunch of the photo and just makes it hard to actually judge the quality of any of the pictures. The good news is, it's laughably easy to get rid of. First, go to the link they send you in your email to look at your photos. Once you're on the main page, pick any photo and hit the Enlarge button on the right side of the screen to bring up a bigger thumbnail. Now you want to open your browser's Dev Tools (to do that in Chrome hit the settings button that's three vertical dots in the top right corner, then go to \"More Tools -\", and then Developer Tools. Now you're going to see a whole bunch of HTML/CSS/JavaScript that looks daunting, but I promise it's easy. Towards the top you'll see a line that says: &lt;form name=\"aspnetForm\"....   It should have a grey arrow next to it. If it's pointed sideways, click it.  Next, scroll down until you see &lt;div id=\"EnlargedPreview\".... Same as before, click the arrow to drop down more stuff. Next, look for &lt;div id=\"enlargedPreview-img-container\"... And hit the arrow again. Next, &lt;span id=\"enlargedPreview-image-span\"... Once you're there, and you've hit that arrow, you should see a line that says &lt;div class=\"animated-watermark\"... Just right-click that line and choose \"Delete Element\" (or press the Delete key on your keyboard with that line selected). Boom! There you go, no more obnoxious watermark/overlay. Now, what they have on the site aren't particularly high-quality images, so this isn't a method for you to \"steal\" the pictures exactly. I was looking at them with the intent to actually buy a couple, and the overlay made it so I couldn't really verify the quality of the pictures at all. With this method you get a nice, clean thumbnail that should hopefully give you a much better idea of which pictures you might want to keep. Also, doing this once will work for ALL of the enlarged photos, just make sure you don't reload the page or you'll have to go through it again. <eos> \n",

I'm thinking to myself, \"what the fuck was that noise?\" After a few seconds I hear it again, but this time it came from this girl in front of me. For a second I thought she was just trying to make a political statement by screeching loudly, but I then saw this colorful little bird happily squawking away on her shoulder. He had a green body and a yellow head, kind of what you would expect some tropical parrot to look like, but smaller. Has anyone else seen this little green squawker? <eos> \n",

Only problem is that Sallie Mae has approved of their loan but they wont say when the money will be delivered or how long it will take.

(798 to be exact, but there were some blank submissions and joke responses mixed in) nbsp; [Here is the link with the default summary that Google Forms provides.]([url link] I know that it isn't the best way to look, and I know that people wanted to do some CS wizardry with it, but I figured some might just wanna see it, soooo there you go! nbsp; For those of you that wanted that raw data, the google sheet can be found [here.]([url link] nbsp; **Side notes and suggestions** I got a lot of great feedback from you guys and it was much appreciated and I (or who ever does it next year) will use it in the next one. This was the first survey I have done and it was fun to set up and make. I know it wasn't the best, but I learned a lot of things that I can fix for next time.  One of the things that I focused on was making it a simple and short. I wanted to avoid a long arduous list of questions so that people didn't get bored. I think I kind of missed the mark in this sense because many people were upset that they weren't represented exactly (notably gender and sexual orientation questions). Also people were too happy with my HIMYM reference :( nbsp; Here are some questions that people suggested to be added and some that I thought of after I released the survey: * Home state (for Out of State students) * Major and minor * Favorite Library * Study Abroad * Favorite Bus Line * Internship experience * Working Part-Time (for current students) * Research experience * More fun questions nbsp; **Edit:** The Google Form Summary link and the Google Sheet should both be view only for @illinois.edu email addresses <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I used my iCard fine yesterday, but didn't leave my dorm much. Today I found out it wasn't working opening the door to my residence hall, so I got it replaced at the ID center. The girl there said it would take about an hour to start working. Another girl at the front desk of my dorm took it and said she had activated it, so it should work within minutes. Just to be safe, I waited another hour anyway. It's been almost two hours now, and this new card still won't work. At this point I'm getting nervous that there might be something else wrong. Has anyone had any experience with this or have any ideas what might be happening? It's definitely a problem if I can't get into my dorm, and I assume I won't be able to get meals or go to the gym either. <eos> \n",

I heard reports of one in the Student Dining and Residential Programs Building and another one in the ARC. (Two look like the one in my photo, two were unlabeled, and one was connected to a set of keys. All of them are the same make and model.) A colleague of mine reported the issue to CITES Security, while an ARC staff member told me they were part of a research project. I don't want to attribute malice, if this is indeed someone's project, so I thought I'd ask Reddit for more information. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Background, I'm a finance major with a passing interest in web development, and no desire to take an overly difficult class. I know 241 is a great class, but a lot of work. I've heard 398 is pretty easy, and haven't heard a tone about 465. Any advice greatly appreciated!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm currently a junior in the CoE. For the past 2.5 years, I've thrived on doing well in school, and even when something went wrong in my personal life (family or relationship issues), I was able to just shrug it off and tell myself school was more important. As I'm getting older, I'm realizing that maintaining a high GPA doesn't mean anything. I'm well off financially, so even the prospect of getting an internship or full time job has no effect on my happiness. I'm thankful for all the friends and family I have, and I'm humbled by knowing people care about me, but I just don't care about myself, and I worry that this mindset will cause me to lose everything and everyone I care so deeply about. Does anyone have suggestions for a new way to look at life? I understand that being a people-pleaser and basing happiness on materialistic things is a recipe for disaster, but I can't ever focus on myself without worrying about the future. Thanks. <eos> \n",

As someone who is, for all intents and purposes, CS and programming illiterate, how should I go about getting involved? I know there are tons of different languages, so which one(s) would be most beneficial to look into? Which are the most practical for an ME to have experience with?

Qualifications: Been to many career fairs and have had multiple internships and have a FT job.  Ask away! Advice: Print out at least 10-15 resumes on resume paper, you can have this done at NotesnQuotes or buy your own paper at any bookstore Buy a padfolio! $20 at walgreens or a bookstore Wear a suit Research companies before hand, at the very least know what positions they are hiring for, but don't be afraid to talk to companies you haven't prepped for. Have a little intro prepared, here's my typical one: Hi, my name's Yamas and I'm a senior majoring in Finance. On campus I'm involved in {insert RSO and position if you have one here} and this past summer I {Had an internship, took courses, (don't say this part if you just fucked around)}. I saw you're currently hiring for the Software developer role and I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about the position. From here, go with the conversation and talk about your experiences to have a reason to give them your resume. I personally like to put a resume on top of my padfolio so they see I have one and may ask for it.  That's all I have off the top of my head but I'm glad to provide more advice if needed. <eos> \n",

Don't worry this is NOT an opinoin piece; it's straight up facts just about what it's like to study abroad and how study abroad has been growing in the recent years.

            "<bos> Hello, I'm hiring one undergrad (preferably senior or junior) from ECE or CS who has knowledge of IoT devices (specially arduino and raspberry pi) and communication between these IoT devices using some wireless module. Message me with your past experience (just a few sentences should be enough-- so that we can start discussing about the project in detail) and I will provide you about the details and constraints of the project. You'll get paid at hourly rate. Working hours would be flexible and we can discuss more about payment.   About the project: I am a PhD student in CEE. This is a university research project that I am working on. We are doing long term health monitoring of a road in Chicago. Several sensors will be (the road will be constructed at the end of this summer) embedded inside the pavement for continuous data collection at different locations (with line of sight). Some sensors would be connected to Arduino to collect data and store it (using datalogging shield). These data should be transferred to Raspberry pi so that we can get the data online. Around 5 arduinos would transfer the data to one Raspberry pi using wireless module like X-bee. Each arduino will collect data every 15 minutes (so, the size of data is not large and sampling frequency is low). I have made a prototype with sensors hooked up with Arduino up to data collection. Your main role would be improving the prototype (as this was my first experience, it might need some improvements). You would work on the data transferring part and uploading it online. Also, minimising power consumption or the whole system as much as possible — as these devices would be installed around 150 miles from the university. I’m open to any other suggestions and improvement that you might have for the project. <eos> \n",

Anyone have any experience with this? What should I do!?!? 2. If you're living in uni housing, DON'T USE TORRENTS WHILE CONNECTED THROUGH CABLE, OR YOUR ACCOUNT. I'm really stuck, nervous and unsure of what to do now. I'm 1. contacting the student legal service organization to meet with their lawyers, and i've emailed my resident director to meet with him soon. Am I in danger of university dismissal?

Not much coding experience but I can help in whatever way possible. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello all. I was wondering if there were any advantages for transferring as a junior level (60+) vs sophomore level (59 credits and below). Im mainly asking to see if i should retake any foreign language courses at my cc. I have completed 3 years of foreign language in high school and so i can either take 3 semesters of a different language or do 4 semesters of the same one. My big reason for asking if this credit/language issue will be a big deal in transferring is that u of i has a lot of competition for their cs programs regardless of which type of degree and so I'm also looking at u i c and other colleges where languages aren't required or I've already placed out of. Basically i don't want to potentially waste time and money on something that isn't guaranteed. Im under the assumption from some people that it is \"easier\" to transfer as a junior level compared to sophomore level because more people will have dropped out by junior year. But is that really true?  <eos> \n",

Not exactly where we'd hold it either, but any suggestions would be great!  *UPDATE: Alright, so it looks like there's some interest. I've seen a lot of these gatherings fail because everyone ends up asking when it's going to happen, and nothing ever happens. So, I'm just going to make an executive decision and say tomorrow (Saturday Jan 21) around 9pm in Siebel 1111 or 1109 if that's taken. I'd say buy-in $5-$10, but I'm open to higher stakes if everyone else is okay with it. If you can't make it, there's always next time. Who knows, maybe we can make it a tradition or something. Snacks and refreshments welcome, you can probably even be compensated for them.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, After hearing countless stories from my high school teachers and reading these two articles: [url link] (some interesting points about Green Street) [url link] (Mainly how fraternities/sororities used to work, certain holidays practiced) I was wondering how much has UIUC (mainly the student life) has changed. At the top of my head, I guess relevant subjects include the days before CPM/Suburban express, when fraternities/sororities had the ability to host public events (I can't exactly remember what they were atm), or when our football team was not in a slump... Edit: obviously the mentioned relevant subjects are not the only ones, still curious about pre-2000 UIUC  <eos> \n",

However the website states \"Courses may be repeated for grade replacement only in those cases in which students received grades of C-, D+, D, D-, or F on the first attempt\". So what if I got a \"C\"? Do I need to purposefully got an C- to be eligable for course replacement? Thanks for everyone's advice <eos> \n",

I just don't get it. Everyone seems to rave about them here and everywhere and how great they are at helping but as an international student who can't visit or call since it's not cheap, I'm really disappointed!

The rest of campus could be parsed out into the various seven nations, each person from the house (dorm) they live in or used to live in. Here: house Tyrell in Highgarden (six pack), house Baratheon in King's Landing (LAR/Allen), house Martell in Dorne (FAR/PAR), house Stark in Winterfell (ISR, Hendricks), house Lannister of Casterly Rock (all the PCH's on West Campus). People in Greek housing could be Targaryen. Apartment dwellers could be Wildlings. We could all get our Game of Thrones fix until season 6 comes out, via some really questionable LARPing.

I am, to be honest, quite nervous about this transition, since I am an international student, and this will be my first time studying in States. So if I may boil down to the bed rock of this post, a) any tips? b) anyone else who may be in my situation? c) on a side note, does anyone know about choral programs in UIUC? I'm a major choir geek, and I would love to continue singing in college.  <eos> \n",

Not only do we have Student Admissions reps on the page to answer any questions about general student life and basic admissions information, we also have Admissions Counselors who can answer more in depth questions about decisions and deadlines and whatnot. When you post questions on here you are not always getting accurate information and you are mainly getting it from the POV of a CS or ECE major. Also on the Facebook page are other new admits who are looking for roommates and trying to get to know people! You all should still have an Admission Counselors email address in your MyIllini account so that you can ask them detailed questions and know the answer is correct. <eos> \n",

I'm coming from Bristol UK I'll be arriving by train from Chicago (I arrive at Chicago O Hare at 3:30 local time), and should be in Urbana-Champaigne around 6 (hopefully).  I have verified profiles on couchsurfing.org and airbnb, which I'm happy to share via pm. Edit! I'm in union station, and will get to Urbana at 10:40. I have an airbnb booking for tonight, thanks for everyone offering: I got a bit stressed leaving. I'll be around uiuc tomorrow if people want to have coffee/food.

            "<bos> I’m a freshman CS student who heard about the “freshman 15” but never really took it seriously. I’ve always been one to eat whatever I wanted with no problem but this semester I took it a little too far. I’ll admit I knew on some level what was happening but things really came to a head a few days ago. While getting ready for an interview, I went to put on a pair of dress pants I hadn’t worn since high school. After a lot of tugging and pulling I got them on, but I’m pretty sure I permanently stretched the fabric. Throughout the interview I was worried the button might decide to let go. Once I peeled them off, I went to check the damage. 18 pounds in one semester. My freshman 15 taken care of in record time, and three bonus pounds for extra credit! I guess I should have seen this coming as my eating habits have been pretty outrageous, plenty of late night orders and second helpings. Did you know you probably shouldn’t have ice cream every day? Clearly I didn’t. So yeah, I have nobody to blame for my current predicament but myself. Anyway, I’m not really looking for advice as I have a pretty good idea what needs to change, although I can’t say the holiday season fills me with hope for losing my chub anytime soon. I guess I’m really looking for solidarity from any other women who went through or are going through the same thing. Did you have an “oh shit” moment like me or was it more of a gradual realization? Were there any bad habits that seemed obvious in hindsight? Did people around you notice or did you manage to keep it hidden? Or did nobody really care? Sorry for the rant but I just wanted to get this off my chest and hopefully hear from others that have dealt with similar issues. If anyone doesn’t want to post publicly I’d be happy to talk over PM, since this obviously is a pretty personal issue. <eos> \n",

It's very safe (believe it or not) and I think a lot of people would enjoy it!  **edit:** There's a lot more interest in this than I thought, but i'm glad you guys seem as in to this as me.

I'd wear shorts and tennis shoes if you're interested in trying anything, it's harder to learn in pants. I'll be teaching the flips into sand first for safety reasons..(don't want to get anyone injured by doing something poorly the first time). So..i'll see whoever comes out tomorrow. I'll be pretty easy to recognize I suppose. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm an AE major also planning on minoring in physics, and I'm in a position right now where I can either take AE 311 next semester, or push it off till a semester later. Next semester I plan on taking PHYS 225, AE 202, ME 300, TAM 212, and am worried that adding AE 311 on to this would be too overwhelming. So, how difficult is AE 311 usually perceived to be, and how much of a time sink is it? Is adding it along with the other classes feasible? Or should I just take an easier class?  For reference, this semester I'm taking MATH 285, MATH 415, TAM 210, PHYS 213/214, and MSE 280, and, while overwhelming at times, I'd say I'm handling the workload pretty well (so far at least). *Edit: Alternatively, replacing PHYS 225 with AE 311, and taking PHYS 225 later is also an option I guess <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This is my first post on Reddit ever, but I have to vent my frustration somewhere. My mistake was buying from Suburban Express in the first place, after my experience early this morning I regret not reading on this sub more. I was on a 4am bus to O'hare -- an hour and half into the bus ride I woke up from my nap to see we are stopped outside a Denny's in bumfuck nowhere (well at least it had a Denny's). I figured it was just a pit stop and didn't quite mind. Then the driver announces that he just got a call from who I now think was probably Dennis the Menace that they have detected duplicate tickets. The two passengers were called out, and they talked to the man on the phone as well as the driver to try to clear things. From what I gathered, they must have submitted the same ticket, but they had two DIFFERENT confirmation e-mails that they showed the driver. They didn't have any further proof, and I'm not even sure if that was legitimate. We were sitting there for about 40 minutes, waiting for what seemed like nothing, and that's when the driver was told to call law enforcement to help intimidate these guys. We waited there in silence (again this was 5:30 AM) for the fucking police to show up. Ultimately, I guess the two customers couldn't plead their case well enough, because after about 10-15 more minutes, the driver opened up the trunk and that's when we all knew they weren't coming back on the bus. They were left stranded at Denny's with the police officers, and then we were off once again. My biggest problem with this is how they made their \"honest\" customers wait for OVER an HOUR just so they could fuck with their \"fraudulent\" customers and kick them off the bus in again, bumfuck nowhere. I don't know the entire story, so it's hard to jump to conclusions as to whether or not they were guilty. I'm lucky, my flight had a nice two hour buffer. But that probably wasn't the case with many of the passengers on the same bus as me. In that recent e-mail they said they value their customers tremendously. They sure do have a very interesting way of showing their appreciation of us.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So a person in my apartment building living in the floor below me thinks it's appropriate to play loud music with heavy bass from late at night to early morning (like continuously from 12am to 6am). It's been really bothersome lately, especially with summer final exams coming up.  What should I do? Should I call the management company or the police about the disturbance? Doesn't this break city ordinances? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Is going to out of state (UIUC in my case) for LAS double major in math and physics worth it or should I just save money and go to a cheap in state school like Mizzou? I'm wanting to save money undergrad since it's not as important for undergrad since you take same classes (not as specialized as graduate schools). I want to work really hard and then get into a good graduate med school. I'm considering UIUC but I may just go to Rolla or just Mizzou (I live in MO) because it's 1/3rd the price. What do you guys think? Thank you so much in advance because the college process is freaking me out and I've been so indecisive and everywhere. A lot of people told me that I'm selling myself short because I could get into way more highly ranked schools than the instate schools, but my family's poor and I'm not a genius so I won't be able to get scholarships at the really good schools (I'll be avg) who have a lot of smart people in them so it's smart to just stay cheap undergrad and work really hard and be at the top of my class to then apply for a good ranked graduate school. <eos> \n",

Dress in reddit colors, bring laptops, eat bacon, whatever. Post what you'll wear or do, if you feel so inclined. Just make sure a fellow redditor knows who we are off the bat. Upvote if you plan to attend. This is exactly one week from our last attempt, which we more or less let the hivemind schedule. It seems to be the time that works best for most people. If you can't make it, please don't post alternate times - this is exactly what killed off our last meet. You can always schedule a time for the meeting after this one. EDIT: Relatively good turn out this time. We got a grand total of 6 redditors to show up and make some decent conversation. Hope to see you all again! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> FUCK YOU. SERIOUSLY, FUCK YOU.  Call me racist or whatever, I'm Asian but there are way more Asian students saving seats, especially Chinese international students since there are a lot of Chinese students here. It's hard for other people not to generalize on race. If you're Chinese, or Asian in general, if you see someone from the same ethnicity saving seat, call them out. Don't just blame other people if they generalize on race, because it's your responsibility to protect yourself and your people by showing other people that you don't tolerate such thing. Be a part of the solution. Don't ignore those actions and call other people racist if they generalize on race, because it's hard not to when a large amount of Chinese students are saving seats at Grainger. Don't just send prayers and thoughts, act!  Sorry for the rant, good luck everyone. <eos> \n",

When I click submit, on handshake it says \"application submitted\" but it opens up a page that sometimes links to that specific job position.

            "<bos> I was doing the MP, and I was feeling incredibly stuck and frustrated on one certain function, so I glanced at github for a source of inspiration and what they've done. I straight up copied the code, without thinking about what they did and there's no way in hell I could replicate it. I drew very heavy inspiration from it and much of their logic is what I used. It was a huge moment of incredible strength on my part, and I feel so pure and ecstatic about what I am sure many CS students have done before me. I cannot contain my self pride. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but I take cheating very seriously, and I think I have found my true fetish. I'm sorry to Professor Heeren and all the other students who actually belong in CS but this has been an incredible experience. I've embraced myself and my resourcefulness, and I hope to confess my true powers to the course staff and soon, to the world. Regardless of my future numerous job offers and graduate school admissions, I've definitely learned how great it is to leech. <eos> \n",

So I am in Math 415 right now, and I have some other friends that are in other sections of the same class with a different professor. I've been asking them what their class average on their tests are and it seems to be significantly (around ~15-20% per test) higher than our class' averages.  Are scales decided solely by the professor, or is there some sort of math department set standard for how grades are handed out?  Even when looking at the exams we have versus exams other professors have given in previous years, ours seem significantly harder. I get that it might be a good thing (learning and whatnot), but I can't help but feel cheated out of a higher grade I could have gotten if I was lucky enough to pick the other section. I guess I'm just kind of looking for some peace of mind concerning this, because this is really stressing me out. Particularly because math counts towards my technical GPA which isn't in the best place right now to begin with. Thanks! <eos> \n",

Police served search warrants at the house, as well as at the Lambda Chi Alpha senior house, 60 E. Chalmers St., Champaign, at about 11 p.m. Thursday. A search of the houses revealed more than 400 doses of MDMA, LSD, cocaine residue, prescription pills, cannabis, nitrous oxide and drug paraphernalia. The U. of I. students were arrested at the fraternity's senior house. I'm not sure if I can post their names on Reddit, but it's on the UIPD police blotter. I know drugs aren't unheard of in college, but I just thought this was an interesting read.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! Alright, I am a British undergraduate student in History and last Fall Semester I was at Illinois. Best four months of my life. I was meant to be there for Spring Semester this year however (a long story I'll spare you) I became horribly ill and had to terminate my studies early, flying home in February. The whole thing was a very unpleasant write-off and it left me smarting for more of what I missed out on. I really loved living in C-U and meeting lots of people from Illinois and I am seriously considering returning for postgraduate study. I am a History Man through and through and I've wanted to go into academia for many years. My GPA for Fall 2013/14 was 3.91 and I'm now a member of Alpha Lambda Delta as a result. My home university, the University of York (UK) has a solid reputation and I have a good record of extra-curricular experience; long-held paid retail work, volunteering, internship with a newspaper, many articles written for student magazines, active role in the UIUC Speech Team and Shakespeare Company. So my resume is reasonably buff, certainly not naked and bare.  I am aware that the Mellon Foundation funds a lot of post-doctoral research and I met a British person teaching a History 400-level course at UIUC who was being funded through this. However, I'm just a puny undergrad and when I graduate in 2016 I'll have to go through the hurdles of Masters, PhD and so on before getting to post-doc. Graduate studies and employment works differently in the UK and although I am supposed to know about the ins and outs of North American and European systems (I write a Research and Departmental column for a student magazine!) the whole affair is still very confusing.  Who can help fill me in on what sort of funding or support is available for graduate study in History? Anything will do, I'm open to all possibilities. Funded Masters courses, teaching undergrads with stipends and tuition waivers... hell if I have to go around campus handing out tickets to people in the damn Chief costume to get funding, I'd do it. There's also Fulbright Commission but they're a different kettle of fish, as we say in rainy old England.  So help me out, people of r/uiuc. Help get me back to where I belong! Many thanks, Jack <eos> \n",

Twinkle Toes and Social Gamers are competing but I'm sure (hoping) that there are still players out there looking to play, as there are a lot of teams of 1-2 on the UIUC IvyLoL page. I can also join a team too, if there is one that needs a 5th player In looking for members, my only requirement is that you have ample experience from this game, be it solo queue or a lot of normal games played. I couldn't care less about solo queue rating. Also, make sure that you have a decent champion pool. My Summoner Name is DaoSyndrome, so buddy me or just message me on here. If necessary, tell me what roles you can or can't play. kthanks <eos> \n",

I usually shop at Aldi and Ruler foods. Ruler has eggs for 66 cents a dozen. Both have Almond Milk for 2.30 a half-gallon. But their prices on berries fluctuates each week.  Where do you find the best prices on meat, yogurt, rice, fresh fruit and veggies, etc? <eos> \n",

They had more than enough extra caps/gowns to go around, plus people were already flooding in to return them from yesterday's ceremonies. BUT.. Thanks for all the help, guys!

Don't let your dreams be dreams! The Office of the Dean of Students is hiring \"Illini Transfer Ambassadors\" (aka ITAs) for New Student Programs. The job basically entails creating programs tailored to transfer students like Fall/Spring Orientation, along with social events throughout the year. You'll gain leadership, public speaking, and planning skills, all while having a great time. Work hours may vary, but are typically 5 hours/week. You must have at least a 2.5 GPA and be a full-time student. The job will start this semester, but carry on until next semester (and further, depending on whether you would like to stay).

Everyone seems to be really down on this team and with so many conference losses in a row I can see why that would get to you. We were there not to log ago.  I think that you are an improving team and I will be rooting hard for you guys in a few weeks in Lincoln. Nebraska is a down program this year and I think that you guys can take them and have a signature win to propel you to a bowl game. Good luck and thanks for being great fans and hosts. <eos> \n",

I've had a history of having not-so-good roommates all of my years here at UIUC, and I'm looking for a group of girls who want to sign a lease together for the 2019-2020 school year! I don't wanna live with any of my current friends bc most of them aren't clean or rlly considerate. I'm a current junior and I would prefer to sign with other juniors because I'm going to have a crazy schedule next year, and my rent limit is $650! I just want to have a fun, stress-free (as stress free as can be lmao) senior year, LMK if anyone is interested!   <eos> \n",

She goes to Urbana High School so unfortunately I can't refer to a directory (that I know of) and contact her directly. Any help would be appreciated.

If I had to guess, the three Niro's Gyros in Champaign-Urbana are all owned by the same entity, but the other Niro's Gyros are owned by other entities.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> This is going to seem like a strange request, but here goes. I'm a software engineer working here in downtown Champaign, and my brother is coming down to visit this weekend. It was just his birthday this past Monday, and since he has been so busy lately (Knox College, Neuroscience / Biology degree, year 4), I wanted to do something nice for him. I went to the used game store and picked him up a PS1, and ordered a copy of his favorite game ever, which he hasn't played in ages, Final Fantasy 8. I'd really like to be able to give him the strategy guide that was made for it, but I can't find any around here. It's too late to order it, and Exile and the pawn shops have none. So, I was wondering if anyone on here would have one they'd consider selling for a couple of bucks to me, tonight if possible. I know it's probably asking the impossible, but there you go! Thanks so much /r/uiuc! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I lived at a JSM apt for the last year. My service dog bit 3 small holes at the carpet of the apartment. So I first asked someone who is an expert at carpet fixing and cleaning and he told me that he can fix and clean the whole carpet up for 300 bucks. But later on, we asked JSM for maintenance and they told me that they can fix it for us and won't charge us for anything. So we asked for maintenance. But when the maintenance came, they told us that they will not fix it when we have a dog in the apartment and they wrote a note saying that they will fix it after we moved out. But after we moved out, JSM replace the entire carpet and asked us for 3000 dollars. Why dont they tell us that the carpet need to be replaced when the maintenance came? I mean we could have someone fix and clean it for 300 dollars. So whenever someone moved out, the leasing office can just charge u 3000 dollars and say that we just replace your carpet? What should we do? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> There's a goose nesting just south of Siebel. Her mate is on the sidewalk, attacking anyone that walks too close to the nest. They are very protective of their eggs. This is bad timing because the Goodwin entrance to Siebel is closed, so I think this area is getting more traffic than usual. Please just walk on the sidewalk to the south (near Uni High) rather than walking by them! He is very unhappy and will definitely try to bite you. Source: studied animal behavior in my undergrad, now come to Siebel daily for bioinformatics. But more importantly, I just watched a kid get attacked by a goose -- it flew at his head and chased him away :( <eos> \n",

            "<bos> UIUC is 20k cheaper per year, even with half-tuition scholarship at USC, but I've heard that the pre-med advising here isn't very good. Also, I looked at what medical schools UIUC students get accepted to, and they aren't very highly ranked, which I found surprising considering that UIUC has pretty strong science programs. Would anyone be willing to share their experiences as a student on the pre-med track here? Thanks so much <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Some cs classes (225 particularly) open up to the college of engineering before they're open to the rest of campus. I'm formally in the college of LAS; but my major is physics (specialized), so I get access to engineering resources and I pay engineering tuition. Does anyone know if this means I'll be able to register for CS 225 when it opens for engineering majors? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have been doing research for about 2 years now.  My group recently put a Ph.D student in charge while the professor is busy this semester and I absolutely can't stand her. She micromanages, is constantly putting people down, does poor work and blames it on other people and takes credit for work she did not do. I like the professor and the other people I work with quite a bit, it is just the addition of the new 'supervisor' that I can't stand.  Whenever we bring up our concerns about her to the professor she put on an act and assures him that things will be fine. After the first time we brought it up she blamed her rude messages on English not being her first language and accused us of being sexist. I'm a women who is also international as are several members of the group. The men in the group are some of the nicest people I know and are definitely not sexist towards her. Some of us are mad because because she's intolerable. The professor is trying to be nice and fair but he is honestly extremely busy and we are only one of the groups he works with.  Should I quit? Try to stick it out? <eos> \n",

I don’t know if there are any car groups on campus, but i wanted to see if anyone with or without cars would like to get something together for some fellow car enthusiasts. We do have some students with some awesome cars on campus and it would be cool to all get together. I know I was at the top of the garage at 6th and John St today and there were a couple other people cleaning and detailing their cars. I think it would be cool to get together and just chill (clean our cars/car show kind of thing). Would anybody be interested? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I have looked through the course explorer website and it seems like cs department is offering less and less courses every summer. Summer 14 had fourteen courses and even offered 173 and 225. But it offered nine courses over summer 15. Finally, Seven courses over summer 16. I mean I have heard that CS courses are highly demanded, especially 125 173, in fall and spring semesters and tons of non-cs majors seek to take these courses. Department said it is doing its best to increase the capacity, but why are they not offering these courses over the summer? Will they continue with the pattern and offer even less amount of courses this summer?  <eos> \n",

And also, did Stepanov go over Hypothesis Testing during the last week (I had to leave for home early so wasn't able to attend classes for that week), the examples uploaded are kinda unhelpful?

I'm currently already signed up for RLST 110, but I heard that that class was pretty difficult. I am pretty interested in the subject matter, which is why I'm still in it. But I thought I might be mildly intrested in Asian Mythology as well, and I've heard that that class is easy. Have any of you taken these classes, or classes with these professors, and what are your opinions of them?  **tl;dr** - What are your opinions on these classes/professors? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> As a resident live in campus circle from Fall 2017 till now, I was really pissed off by what the managers did. First, Their customers service is really bad. Not replying to customers emails(especially the managers). Not apologizing for charge us incredibly large amount of fees for no reasons. Ignore the complaining and comment emails. Force the residents to give a five star review ( if you give a low or average comment they will delete the review). Second, no cleaning staff is working. The study room is dirty, the trash room is surrounded with large boxes. The cabinet is stained. There are dog shits on the floor and hall ways. The elevators' security certification is expired. Third, the leasing office keep the renew rent high in the sky and persuade the current resident to renew( the renew rent will be the same or lower as they said before we leased in the fall 2017 semester). And then they keep the rent lower after the current residents renewed the room. If you live near the pool, they will charge you extra fee every month. However no one actually go to the pool and the water is dirty floated with leaves and yellowish stuff. They never clean the pool either. Strongly recommend not to live in that place. <eos> \n",

I've checked a few of my classes that I would want to take over the summer but all of them are offered in the morning/early afternoon.

            "<bos> yeah the title says it all. I’m a freshmen and I was placed on academic probation for having a shitty senior year and messed around too much and now I’m on academic drop.  I’m currently across the world in another country. I got the email a couple days ago and instantly broke down and started crying. Then I started thinking about how it could actually be beneficial in a way. Almost like a clean start kind of. I wanted to do business and I KNOW I am capable of doing anything I set my mind to but one mistake led to another and I fucked up. Nonetheless, I have some questions about what this means.. if anyone can answer and/or give me tips/advice them that would be fabulous.  questions:  - so I went to look at Parkland Community college and it says to register there you can’t have any outstanding loans.. does this mean I have to pay off the 7k I took in loans for my first semester at UIUC before registering at Parkland?  - so what happens to my credits? Do they “transfer” / are they still valid?  - since I’m “no longer an active student at UIUC” do I have to move out my dorm and by when?  - what are my chances of getting back into UIUC? What gpa do I have to maintain around? (Sure as hell hope I don’t fuck up this time)  - it said in my letter that i would have to apply back into DGS? Did I read that wrong bc if I apply again next year then I’ll be a sophomore in DGS?  -when I reapply at uiuc (if I choose to do so) is it to a specific college or what?  If anyone has been in a similar situation and got out of this “hole” please please help me out and give me advice on what I should/shouldn’t do.  The way I see this is I fcked up and have to pay for the consequences. it sucks a lot. I’m probably not telling my parents either and just saying I want to save money now and don’t wanna spend $800/credit hour vs $300 at parkland. Or I’ll come up with some other bullshit excuse. I want to tell them but my foreign parents? No no I’ll give em a heart attack.  Thank you in advance, any advice is helpful.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am taking the class this fall and wanted to know: - How is Kolla as an instructor? She is teaching it in the fall and I haven't heard anything about her. All I know is that Chandra is perceived to be difficult. - How does it compare to 241 in terms of workload and difficulty? - How feasible is it to do well in the class without a \"group\"? They say it's better to take the class with a group so you'll have people to do the homework with, but how bad would it be solo? - How to prepare for the class over the summer? I downloaded all homeworks, lecture notes, and labs from Chandra's Spring 2017 site. Is there any other way to prepare? - In general, how does one do well in that class?  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I ended the semester with around a 1.6 GPA putting me on probation for next semester. I have already been accepted into my study abroad program for UIUC and my university abroad, my financial aid has already been adjusted for study abroad and I’ve already bought my plane ticket and paid my living arrangements. They still have to let me go right? <eos> \n",

After you change your password, you will be able to use your NetID and password to log in to all Illinois websites and apps, including ones where you previously had to use your EnterpriseID. Visit [url link] select Change Password, and log in with your current NetID and password to sync both IDs. If you don’t want to change your password, you still can set new password recovery options on that same page. The new recovery options mean you won’t have to answer security questions if you forget your password. Resets can be done by email or by text message. If you DO change your password, remember to update anywhere you may have auto-saved your old passwords, especially your phone. If you need help with any of this, just contact the Tech Services Help Desk (techservices.illinois.edu/get-help), or stop by one of our six computer lab locations (go.illinois.edu/GetTechHelp) and we’ll get you all set up.

            "<bos> Hello /r/UIUC, I'm currently a non-traditional student at DePaul University about start my second year but have a junior standing. I'm currently majoring in accounting and finance but I am probably going to change the finance double major to CS. How hard is it to transfer into the Math/CS major? I would have most of the requirements in the transfer handbook except for MATH 241 Calc III, because I have to take three calc classes to equal Calc I and Calc II. I had to take a lot of catch up math classes during my first year because I was out of school for a long time. My gpa is currently 3.38 but I might be able to bring it up some before I apply. How does double majoring work? Would I have to be accepted into the business school too? I would also have most of the requirements to transfer into the business school except for the language requirement. Is it hard finding a job at Urbana-Champaign during the school year?  Thanks for any information <eos> \n",

I did read up on university housing page for winter housing which stated that housing would be from December 19 to January 13 with $40/night. Is it worth staying over the winter break vs. going back and forth from Korea?  <eos> \n",

I'm interested in hosting a watch party for Man U v Liverpool in this weekend's FA cup 4th round, and I want to find out who would be interested or willing to commit to coming.  The match kicks off at 6:45 am, so I am thinking I would rather do a watch party for the replay around 11am. I have foxsoccer.tv and espn3.com capable of streaming on my 46\" plasma, so we should be fine as far as that goes. I have comfortable seating for 7 or 8 and can expand it to 12 or so if it proves popular. What I'm trying to find out is, who would be interested in coming.  Also, having been burned by things like this in the past, I'd like a couple of people to commit to coming before I buy snacks/drinks etc, just to have one or zero people show. Alternatively, people could bring their own snacks.  Please respond here or PM if you would like to come or would definitely come. I would go ahead with this thing even with 1 or 2 other confirmed guests, so it's not like I need a threshold, only positive interest. Edit: Looks like there's enough interest, we'll do the replay at 11am on Saturday. Try not to know the result ahead of time, and if you do, don't share it. Respond here if you want to come and I'll PM the address and time details to you. <eos> \n",

I'd really like to double major in econ or math or industrial engineering, how would I go about becoming a double major? Also, how hard would it be to declare a double major (cross-college) by the first semester?

I am scouting for interest in organizing a formal community (probably high school) league this summer, and am curious as to what already exists in town. What games are currently played? I am also curious as to goals, successes and difficulties existing groups have experienced. Crossposted at [r/Chambana]([url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos>   I had a really tough time my first two years dealing with severe depression, and as a result, my GPA is much lower than I would like it to be. I started getting help last semester, and now I am trying to improve my grades, but I am finding it really difficult because my study habits are very poor from not being able to practice them much the first two years. I currently have a 2.47 GPA and I really want to try and raise it to at least a 3.1 by the time I graduate, but that seems like a very daunting task. I wanted to hear some inspirational stories. Have any of you guys raised your GPA by a considerable amount? Any tips for effective studying? <eos> \n",

I know Python, and plan on taking STAT 440 (Data management with SAS) next semester. Any opinions on INFO 490?  Introduction to Data Science will introduce students to the tools and technologies that are necessary to work with large data. Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand the basic concepts of data science from data acquisition through data understanding. Students will learn how to work at a Unix prompt and how to use the Python programming language to process, visualize, persist, model, and mine large data sets. Students MUST have access to a computer on which they can install software (in particular the virtual machine software). No prerequisites other than a desire to work with data! <eos> \n",

NOW its next semester and i think i'll fail all my classes and i doubt i can bring them up. i haven't even been doing anything to help myself because i feel like its over and i should give up. i talked to my counselor but even talking to her doesn't help because the things she suggests me to do, i can never bring myself to do it. i'm digging a deeper hole for myself to die in. i'm just like really avoidant about everything now because i don't wanna talk about it to anyone because i'm embarrassed and everyone is doing soo well besides me and i don't know how to explain my situation without breaking down in tears?  i know i have to talk to my advisor asap but how is she going to help i'm just going to embarrass myself because she'll think i'm stupid and lazy. (i'm probably going to go talk to her today actually but i'm fucking nervous) i don't KNOW what to do with myself anymore this whole thing is making my anxiety worse to the point that i'm nauseous and my suicidal thoughts come back just thinking about school and my future getting dropped will honestly be the end of my life like i am actually serious i'll kms  TL;DR - withdrew 1st sem; fucked up this semester bc depression didnt get better; scared to talk to advisor, professors, anyone ever bc embarrassed <eos> \n",

I know its not a lot, but I kinda get discouraged when I see the required qualifications on the job description so thats why my number is low.

I recieved a huge inheritance from one of my parents, and I've been working and trying to save money as well to finance my education. I'm majoring in Comp Sci, so UIUC is an amazing opportunity. I'm already set to go to another school in the fall as a transfer \\(my first school didn't have a real comp sci program\\) , but I'm willing to put things off for a semester and take a couple of classes at CC to catch up if I could go to Urbana. Is this feasible? Will admissions readmit me if I was accepted as a freshman? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a sophomore CS + Stats student, and after the career fair I got a few followups for interviews. One company at Research Park offered me a position after an interview (really large company, definitely interested in interning there), and I'm interviewing with another company in Chicago soon (technically a much smaller company, but still very well known, also interested in interning there). For more personal reasons, I'd like to stay the summer in Champaign, as most of my friends and girlfriend are also gonna be here for the summer + I already have a place down here, however I'm not sure if working at the company in Chicago (if I even get an offer) would ultimately be more beneficial to my career. Summer 2019 I no doubt want to intern in Chicago, and my plan for after graduation is to find a full-time position somewhere in Chicago. But for this specific upcoming summer, I'd like to stay in Champaign. Is there any real benefit to choosing a potential internship in Chicago over one at Research Park? Will it give me a better shot of interning in Chicago next year at a different company, or as a sophomore is there not really a difference? Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone! I was already more set on staying but you all made me feel better about it <eos> \n",

They usually ride out at dusk (leaving from Meadowbrook Park in Urbana) to the Sidney Dairy Barn. Some head straight back after ice cream, some take a more circuitous route home. And I believe last time there were 2 groups. The group with children left maybe an hour earlier than the dusk group. *This is a heads up that the 14th Moonlight Bicycle Drive (also know as \"Moonlight Bike Ride\") is scheduled to take place on Saturday, July 20. Although July's full moon is on Monday, July 22, the moon will be 94% full on Saturday, and Saturday is a better night for most. So put the date on your calendar. I'll provide more info the week before the ride.* Reflective gear and good lights are encouraged! <eos> \n",

I'm wondering if there are any groups on campus that would get together to play some rock/alternative music (I happen to like those the most). I think that would be very fun, and would help me learn faster.  Also, I'm trying to get a guitar. I've asked some people, and many say that I should be expecting to spend between $2-300. Also, where should I purchase one? Craigslist probably won't work too well.

Is it hard to get into them as freshmen? Do people typically smoke weed at the parties/ how are the campus police if any? 4) How are the dorms? Which are the best?

I never considered applying to an Ivy league school until a friend mentioned it. I would be a Junior transfer student planning to major in Econ. I had a 1350 SAT score for Math/CR in high school. I did alright for most of high school until senior year. Due to my issues with senior year I decided to go to a cc first. I am currently a Business major with a 3.3 gpa which should go up this semester. I have been an active student life, volunteering and will be graduating a semester early with an associates. Frankly I am hesitant when it comes to applying to any four year schools because of my senior year of high school. I am afraid that because I only went to a cc for 1 and a half years they will take into account that year heavily. Also since I will not be attending any school during what should have been my 2nd spring semester, is there anything I should do to bulk up my application? I live in a smaller town so it would be tough to find a job/internship pertaining to my major (though I will still try).

I frequently see other drivers yelling at people through car windows or screaming and pointing, or pedestrians stopping in the middle of the street because they don't like the way someone is driving (saw it happen to someone else and had it happen to me as well). I've driven through Boston and Connecticut a fair amount and there was less road rage there. Is it just a dislike of Cornell students being in Ithaca?

I've also kind of asked this before and the answers were good but it was less specific and since add/drop is coming around I'm going for it again.  I'm honestly not the best math student it's just a cool subject to me and I like a challenge so why not.  Anyway I'll be a junior and only just finished multi (yeah I know) so my question is: should I just steer clear of any type of honors courses and take math courses that would be less difficult and hopefully help build more skill?  I'm thinking I'd like to focus more on the Algebra track than analysis so maybe it would make sense to do the following this semester: 3110 (non-honors analysis for the track) 3320 (number theory) 3040 (prove it)  And use spring to take care of the rest of analysis track plus an algebra course. The 3040 course would be to get a better understanding on proofs, number theory the professor said could help with the same (plus it's interesting) and I was told 3110 is good and not too heavy. Then use senior year to take honors linear algebra track mixed with other courses? Or would it be too late to take honors lin alg my senior year?  The OTHER probably not so smart option would be the following:  Take an honors track this year (either alg. or analysis) with one other math course each semester (since I'm sure that's all I'd be able to handle). If I did that should I use Prove It as my second math course to reinforce my use of proofs? (Also I'm sure it's probably a really bad idea to take an honors course without a good understanding of proofs I'm just kinda running out of time so it's stressing me out and I don't wanna avoid them altogether).

I'm absolutely ecstatic that I got accepted the other day ED to the College of Engineering at Cornell University!

I don't know if I actually enjoy chemistry, or if I just like it because it comes easily to me. What I do know is that I want to do both engineering and business.

OR seems to be a major that really integrates aspects of business and engineering, and I've also read that it pays well. However, I'm having a hard time really getting a grasp of what OR really is, or what I job in OR is like. Do people ever do a OR major with a minor in business?

I understand how difficult it is these days to get one and I am aware how fortunate I am. I didn\\'t have a great time in college. I wanted to go to my state school, but my parents expected more and so I went to Cornell. Majored in Computer Science and just graduated, and yet I feel like I can only code at the 1110-2110 level. I mostly BS\\'ed my way through classes and abused office hours for answers. My projects in the higher level classes were basically the TAs\\' projects. My parents expected me to get a job, so I got a job. It\\'s actually quite good as far as jobs go. 6 figures, nice people, and room to grow. I always wanted to start my own business but I never really knew what I wanted to start. Now I find myself starting work in a city far from home that I have no interest living in working a job in a subject I wasn\\'t particularly good at or had much interest in.  I sincerely believe I\\'ll be the dumbest person at this company by far. No, this really isn\\'t imposter syndrome. I literally couldn\\'t do basic arithmetic during one of my interviews. I thought I horribly failed them, and somehow got the job. I looked up some of my coworkers, and their accomplishments are so far beyond what I\\'ve done it\\'s just funny at this point. I could barely handle the CS curriculum and no extracurriculars and these people were high school valedictorians, won major national competitions, etc. What do I do?  ***EDIT***: I\\'d like to thank everyone for your responses.

I am in my junior year at a smaller state school in Illinois and am starting to look at graduate programs to continue with education instead of jumping into industry. I haven't decided on which path I would like to take yet, but I'd like to know if you think I even have a chance at getting into Cornell's CS program.

I have a lot of academic interests/passions and I\\'m trying to prioritize them before the next pre-enroll period. I went through the list of minors that Cornell has to offer and was left with three that interested me most: Info Sci, Linguistics, and the Dyson Business Minor for Engineers. This might sound crazy, but I want to minor in all three. I\\'m willing to put in the work, and with careful planning I think that it actually won\\'t be as much work as it sounds.  Am I allowed to use my major-required elective courses to \"double-count\" for minors?  For example, I want to take CS 4740 and CS 4744 as part of my CS electives. These courses are cross-listed as LING 4474 and LING 4424 respectively, and are acceptable classes to count towards the linguistics minor. LING 4424 is even allowed for the Info Sci minor--is it ok to use one course to fulfill a major requirement and two minor requirements all at once? Another question I have is: are minors even \"useful\"? I\\'m using them primarily as a way to organize my interests into groups of courses that are deemed related enough by Cornell to be called a minor. But what will employers think if they look at my future resume and see CS Major and triple minor? I want it to reflect my academic passions but am worried it will make it look as if I gamed the system (which I guess I kind of am). Also just for fun, what are your majors / minors? What drives your passions? Personally, I love CS because I view it as a nice mix between science and art. It\\'s a great way of approaching problem solving and what I believe to be the future of humanity. <eos> ', \"<bos> I've been at Cornell for some 3.5 weeks now and want a haircut.

Around a month ago (and every week after), we all would set aside project goals and agree on who was doing who. When these goals were rather easy (write up an idea for the project, write up what you'll do), all 4 of us contributed. Now though, in the last two weeks of the project, three of us have been meeting our goals while the fourth hasn't taken the time to update us on his progress. As it's really too late to turn back now, we see this partner will have had little contribution to the project overall. Does this look bad to graders, and would it be better to just attribute some work to him or to be honest and just lay out the facts? If this were something little, I wouldn't mind just attributing the work to him. But this work was pretty significant to the project, and I ended up having to do it all in addition to what I was assigned to do.  And just to note, we haven't left this partner out in the dark.

I visited Cornell a few years ago for a conference (what a pretty campus you have!) and bought a hoodie as a memento. I was wearing said hoodie recently around my campus back home.

I plan to take Japanese AP in highschool next year. My community college average GPA from this year is 3.95, but my Japanese grade is around a 3.6, which brings my total grade down a bit. Instead of the standard senior social studies and English classes offered at highschool, i took English 102 and Macroeconomics. What are my chances? <eos> \", \"<bos> Amazon has a pretty sweet deal.

Next year, we need to turn things around and restore Dragon Day to it's former glory. How do we do this, you ask? 1. Better day. The day before Spring Break, half of campus has already headed back to Westchester and Long Island. Terrible choice of day for a campus holiday.  2. Darties. Drunk kids are important for hyping up things that are typically boring, like sports. They would be great for the parade.  3. More engineering involvement. A gang of red-painted students should be roaming and annoying campus like the Archies. Plenty of strange engineering kids would love to do this. Dear god that Phoenix was depressing. We can do better. This would be a fun project for ENGRI classes to work on to make friends first semester and get some group project experience.  4. Bring back the F I R E.

There\\'s general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here! **Housing FAQ** * ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?*** I\\'ll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low.  * ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?*** Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option.  * ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?***  Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don\\'t find anything you like there, Googling \"Cornell Apartments\" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.   <eos> ', \"<bos> Last year there was news that Trevor Noah would be coming in September, but I haven't been able to find anything recent related to the event.

We are launching a treasure hunt at Cornell in the fall and are still looking to hire some students to help run the treasure hunt. This is a paid position and a VERY fun job as you will actually be hiding gift cards around Campus, collegetown, and working at a fun start-up company! You will get to take gift cards, put them in envelopes, and hide them around! Then you would easily update the campus pursuit smartphone app with hints and clues as to where the gift cards are!

We got a long alright and while he wasn't perfect, he certainly wasn't bad either.This left me with a double to myself for a while, which was pretty nice. When the spring semester began, I got a new roommate. Apparently he was also in a double by himself before, but didn't tell me why (I assumed it was due to some reason similar to mine). But after about a week and a half, I understand why. He snores. So. fucking. loud.

It's normal for candidates to get 600+ votes or to win in a landslide.

So background info, I was admitted to Cornell for Electrical and Computer Engineering as a freshman. I started off with a very difficult semester and begin to become less and less motivated in terms of what I was studying. To be completely honest, I much more enjoyed taking liberal arts courses in high school then STEM courses. Another thing that decreased my interest in engineering was my acceptance into a project team. Project teams provide students with a real life application and experience in terms of engineering, and I started to notice that compared to the other members who were extremely passionate with their roles, I started to heavily hate the fact that I just wasn't as passionate and wasn't having any fun. I felt like even though I got into a very top project team, it felt more of a burden then fun. One thing that I did seem to grow more interest was in the business subteams. For some reason, what they were doing actually seemed fun to me, and I started to grow more and more interested in business. Rightly so, I started to consider to transfer to AEM or the Hotel School. However, I had no experience in High School with business, and transferring to AEM or the Hotel School is extremely difficult. My next option was considering switching to Arts for Economics, but I'm not sure if majoring in economics will exactly be what I want to do. I feel constricted by the engineering curriculum and dislike the fact that I most likely won't find what I legitimately want to study at all. I considered majoring in OR, which at the moment, somewhat interests me, but I feel like it interests the most out of the other engineering majors because it is the closest to business. I am working to do as best possible as I can in my classes this semester to obtain the highest possible GPA. But I atleast want to start planning for next semester soon so that I can make a smooth transition to whatever I ultimately decide.

For GOV I have 5's on Comp and US Gov. so I dont need to take the intro classes but I was wondering how difficult the 3000 level courses in Gov are. Maybe I should wait til second semester to take one of those. For Phil i was thinking of taking intro to PHIL but i heard that most people who major in phil dont actually take that and skip right to a 2000 level class. If so what do you guys recommend at that level for first semester. Lastly I had a question about requirements. The one thing I hate about CAS is the language requirement.

End goal is to work in industry (i.e. not do a thesis based masters). - do you enjoy the program overall? - What are the main differences between Cornell tech and Cornell? What solidified your choice between the two? - How would you rate your professors? - Content of the courses, how in depth have you found them? Difficulty of the courses? - I saw that it is possible to get an internship so long as it relates to your degree, have you or anyone in the program done this? - Do you think the overall price is worth it? - How do you like living in NYC (if CT)?

I've been really depressed at Cornell. No friends, no nothing. I've been going to Cornell Health which helped somewhat (I mean, my social situation hasn't really improved). I thought I'd meet most of my friends through clubs, but I was pretty much rejected from all the clubs that I had applied to.  I am trying ridiculously hard to get out of this shitty mental state. I tried saying hi, smiling to pretty much every single person in my class (I'm not going to complain actually--I gained a few acquaintances but no real friends).

I got a 4 on the AP Calc AB exam as a junior, and didn't take another calc class as a senior. I was wondering whether I should take the as math courses or engineering math courses for cs. Is there a difficulty in difficulty, application to computer science, grading curve or theory vs practically?

Now to get into it, I'm not sure what course to take next semester. On the one hand, it's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that you should take Honors Analysis if you're considering grad school which I think I'd do if I did math (again, I swear I know I'm late hahaha). On the other hand, I'm not all that comfortable with proofs so I don't want to go into the class and then drown in unpreparedness. Still, doing Non honors intro analysis prevents you from being able to move into the next honors analysis class which would suck.  Wondering if anyone has advice as for where to go from here. Are there perhaps books you think are good on math proofs that I could read over the summer and prepare myself for writing more rigorous proofs? On the complete other hand, I don't think I'm much of a fan of the analysis side of math and think I'd prefer the algebra side. That said, I'm not sure of whether or not to take the analysis track first or the algebra track. Of course, it would be nice to take both concurrently but there's essentially zero chance of me being able to take both an honors analysis AND honors algebra with my current level of mathematical prowess. Perhaps I should take one honors next semester and one non-honors? The main problem is I'm running out of time, but if I'm considering grad school I'd like to take as many math courses as I can in the next two years.

Right now, I'm a freshman majoring in physics at a top 50-60 USNEWS school. I’d like to major in Chemical Engineering (my current school does not offer the major). I’m interested more in the biological side of things, i.e. biotech/biochemical engineering, and in modeling and simulation (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations, and other computational stuff). Ultimately, working in research, either through grad school/academia or industry/startup is the goal. Academically, I’m doing well at my school (3.93/4.0 GPA), participate in extracurricular activities and am working in a lab as an assistant (computational physics lab). My HS grades were alright (3.7 UW GPA), and I retook my SATs for a higher score. My main questions are about the ChemE department. I’d just like to get any idea of it (or the engineering school) from a student’s perspective. Beyond that, any information on Cornell in general, the atmosphere of the school, Ithaca, and transferring would be very helpful. How have you liked Cornell so far, and would you recommend transferring (if you are someone or know somebody who has)? Also, if someone could provide any insight on transferring credits- I skipped a good amount of courses through AP credit and placement exams at my current school, but I don’t know how that would work with Cornell (Cornell doesn't accept some AP credits that my school does).

The reason I am worried is that I want to go into finance (IBanking), and although Cornell is a target school for this (as apposed to a semi target for my former school), I didn't know how little the curriculum was targeting finance. Although I love the interdisciplinary education, I was hoping it would center more around finance and economics. Once my dad showed me the career report for ILR I started freaking out a bit. My plan is to major in ILR and get minors in Business and Econ. But because of my new found stress I have been looking around and I realized that in order to go from a minor in Econ to a Major I only need to take three more classes.  I am thinking of now double majoring in ILR and Econ or switching into Econ itself and just using all my electives in finance/econ classes.  Can anyone speak to how open Cornell is to double majors, especially as a transfer? I saw some info in CALS but nothing about between CAS and ILR.

Unfortunately, the link to the surveys requires a Cornell netid.

As is, I may be able to fly into Syracuse affordably in May/June for a few days and drive down. Is that too late, or is July the best time to look? * A lot of the complexes I\\'ve found online near central Ithaca are charging extra for a parking spot (What?!). Does this mean it\\'s better to outside Ithaca? What are the downsides to commuting?

I just received an email from Dyson Admissions and was informed that I would not be accepted for fall 2018 from the wait list but that I would be given a Transfer Option (TO) to Cornell.

Also that people who don’t get into SCS at CMU use ECE as a backup and aren’t actually interested in major itself -really want to have internship opportunities in college as early as after freshman year -want to work on project teams like robotics clubs -want to do research -worried that Greek life is overbearing at Cornell.

The one thing I just don't know what to do about is BEE 2600, which is Principles of Biological Engineering.

The TAs didn't even know there were errors and couldn't get the information or directions from the Head TA who was supposed to be at office hours at that time. That pretty much forced me and my group to spend that day and the day after trying to figure out what we can and cannot do for the case study since no one knew how to actually do the case study.

I've tried CAPS and they don't want to facilitate weekly meetings but switching to an outside provider seems so difficult, not to mention I'm unsure if I could afford co-pays. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do? I've been thinking perhaps group therapy, but I haven't found any. A lot of my depression stems from loneliness, and it's been really hard to meet people. I'm a sophomore right now, and honestly, I just don't want to come back to Cornell next year. I don't know what to do at this point, and just feel hopeless, but also incredibly guilty, because so many people would love to be in my place, yet I want to leave. <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm debating whether or not I should take wines in the Hotel school.

Anyway, I still felt decently optimistic and told myself third semester was gonna be the best one yet!!! Now that it's over, I've come to the conclusion that I'm simply stupid.

If you are assigned to a temporary space, we would continue to work to find you a permanent space on campus through the coming months as spaces across campus become available.\" Is that preferable to renting an apartment off-campus, in Collegetown or maybe Fall Creek? Should I start looking now or continue to wait and hope I get temporary housing and eventually a permanent place?

Also, if you’re going to get an MEng in a field you’re already majoring in, and the requirements for the MEng are basically the courses you have taken or are going to take for your BS, do you just get to take electives instead?

People in the CS major here relentlessly talk about test scores, GPAs, internships, projects, connections, etc. So much of it is humblebrag and its honestly disgusting. \"oh, that project took you more than 30 seconds? dude are you sure you wanna do CS?\" \"you don\\'t have a 4.33?

I took 3 years of Spanish in hs, but part of the reason why I delayed is that it my Spanish is very, very rusty and doesn't hold up. Frankly, I have almost no desire to go back to it in a classroom setting at this point. I've tried to refresh over the break, but I just couldn't engage with it at all. High school left a bad taste in my mouth. I've had the idea of learning german in the back of my head for about two years now and dabbled in it a bit.

I am trying to decided between living in the Ecology house or the Just about Music house, and wondered if any of you could give me some advice. I love being outdoors and going on walks etc, but I am also a musician who would like to jam. I'm looking for a house that has a good social scene as I want to make new friends. I am wondering if anyone has any experience living in either of these houses and can shed some light. From what I've read the Ecology house seems to be less social then other houses and I do not know much about the JAM house apart from its facilities but from the photos I've found it doesn't look very 'busy'.

Will it be significantly harder?

I was interested in transferring to AS to study as a Computer Science major.

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don\\'t take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Cornell give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much \"catching up\" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for Cornell? Thank you so much for your input. =) PS.: A few weeks ago I posted this same message on the Biweekly sub, but I got no answers. Probably, there were not a lot of graduate students there.

Initially (in HS) I thought I'd be studying physics in college. Later on, when I first came to school I thought maybe math and/or econ. Then I took some gov classes and enjoyed writing a few papers. My interests are always changing to the point I'm not sure if I like everything or nothing. At this point, I could easily complete a double major gov/econ (and I want to do a double since I can't narrow down to one). At the same time, I've become really interested in linguistics while also thinking maybe I should go back to my initial interest in math. You can see I'm all over the place. I've met with my academic advisor/career services and the meetings do help but after I leave and am left to my own devices I'm back to indecisiveness. Basically I was wondering: 1) How did you know what you wanted to major in? Were you totally passionate about it (like all these people seem) or just figured it's good enough? 2) Also, for people that majored in something and ended up going to grad school or working in a field not fully related to their major, what was your experience like? My biggest fear is limiting myself in my major and discovering later on I don't enjoy what I'm doing as much as I thought but being unable to switch my path. I've talked to some people (professors etc.) that went to grad school for something completely unrelated to their undergrad and it gives me hope that your major isn't your future written in stone, but it still worries me.

The AEM program really draws me as I've always loved Science and wouldn't mind continuing to learn about it while focusing on business.

Although, with desire to fulfill prerequisites (upon your advice), I am considering registering in Biology, Writing (at another university) and Chem or Physics.   A few questions (mostly based on AEM transfer info on Cornell site)  1) I see that a prerequisite is two writing/English courses. My school only offers one, should I take one at the other university in my city (Dalhousie)? If I don't will it void my application?  2) In terms of the recommended courses, do most successful transfers have all of these courses? I'm going to register in a few of them next semester, but it is too late to take the full-year biology course. Would my application suffer greatly if I am missing 1 or 2 of them?

How would one go about studying for it?    You can definitely look into a different proficiency test. I think the French textbook has it. If you take the Language School course a few years ago, they gave a paper out that says \"French is your first language.\" It was pretty easy, and you don't need the actual language material.      I think the French textbook has\n",

I took French all through high school, and before that I'd already taken it for a year in middle school, so it was still pretty fresh in my mind when I took it, but here's what I did. I just looked over all of my notes and tests from the highest two levels, and looked around on the internet for a few practice tests. Review your basic grammar stuff. Make sure you've really got it all down. It probably wouldn't hurt to go over vocab lists from your high school notes if you took it in high school/still have the notes. This is all assuming you're not a native speaker. If you are, you probably wouldn't need to study now, would you?  \n"
