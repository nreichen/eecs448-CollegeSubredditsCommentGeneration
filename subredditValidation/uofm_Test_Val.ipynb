Since it's the fall term, It is very hard for me to find a place. Plus I am in Canada right now, so it's even more difficult for me. Most of the houses/apartments that are listed are 12 month leases starting in August/September. /r/uofm Do you have any tips/suggestions on what I should do? I checked out craigslist, cribspot (all 12 month leases), airbnb (doesn't have that many for 4 months). Should I try U of M residence? Or are they restricted to U of M students only? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I was accepted as a transfer student to LSA (CS), and Michigan gave me no aid (except for the $5500 gov. loans everybody gets). I am OOS. If I appealed for more financial aid, do you guys think I would be able to get it? My EFC is $35000, so there's $30,000 of need. If they gave me $15,000 per year, I would be willing to take on the financial burden and attend. Thank you for any insight you can provide, I really appreciate it. <eos> \n",

I'm curious about the culture of each of the co-op houses, namely Nakamura, Lester, Minnie's/Mich, Vail, Black Elk, and others if you know a bit about them. How often they have parties and bands playing, their socialization with other co-ops, level of drug usage, the house's recognition/interest by other frats/students, and list any particular advantages/disadvantages to that particular house. Please keep your information based on the last year or two. Thanks. <eos> \n",

Does anyone have any advice for me transferring? I'm extremely driven and determined to put in the work necessary to go to UM. Also, the UM website says you need a 3.0 gpa to transfer, but I don't wanna take any risks on not getting in for sophomore year so what's a realistic gpa to shoot for that will almost for sure get me accepted? Last question, when are acceptances announced for transfer students? Thanks so much Go Blue! <eos> \n",

I heard 240 is a weeder class for engineering students, so it's very difficult. However, since I'm taking 160 right now, I know how difficult 260 must be since it's the honors version.

I assume that there will be heating indoors so is it necessary to wear snow boots and a million layers when getting to different classes on the Ann Arbor campus (I don't know how far apart buildings usually are or how big the campus is). I'm going to buy winter clothes these next few days so any input on what I need to wear or a list of clothes that I should buy/bring would be extremely appreciated!  <eos> \n",

Basically, I only need 5 credits this winter to graduate but due to the stipulations of my financial aid, I will be required to schedule full-time in order to retain my aid package. This means that I am in search of 2 classes to round out my schedule. Do any of you have suggestions for classes that I should try? Any at all that you might say, \"man, I wish I would have had a chance to take this class.\" It doesn't need to be in any specific department or level. Literally just two classes to get me to full-time status. Thanks in advance everyone! <eos> \n",

Lots of companies are looking for people graduating either this year or next year, is that a hard requirement? Like would they automatically discount my application based on the fact that I don't graduate then? I know that if I'm a freshman in a sea of junior applicants I'll be denied regardless, but I'm thinking of applying to some then talking to people at the job/internship fair about it tomorrow. <eos> \n",

I've been going to CAPS, but I think that it would be good for me to see the same person with relative frequency. Anyway, there are a lot of different therapists to choose from online, and I'm wondering if anybody could recommend somebody with whom they've had a positive experience. It's important that this person's office is near campus (within easy walking distance of the diag), and preferably that they are a woman.  Thanks! <eos> \n",

I was just wondering how possible is it to land an internship with a lower IOE gpa (like.. 2.7~3.3). Just a background info... I'm ending my sophomore year as an Electrical Engineer. The whole semester, I hated doing circuits and had no interest in it. I thought I understood the concept though. Studied my ass off for the exam, completely bombed the 215 exam. 100% know that I'm not going to pass the exam, and possibly even the course. As for 270, I'm not sure how I did, but I still bombed the second midterm. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of interest, or because I don't study enough (even though I studied my ass off). But if anybody could help me out, I'd appreciate it! **TLDR; How successful are IOE majors with low GPAs?** EDIT: Small clarification. When I entered college, I planned on doing IOE, since I always heard it was more business based. I'm not trying to switch to IOE just cus it's easier, but because it seems to be more business-like. Currently, I wish I was a business major, not an engineering major, but it's too late for that. However, I tried out Electrical Engineering, because I heard patent law programs prefer EE's over any other type of engineers. I now realize that doing EE just for a law program isn't worth it. Thanks for all your help again. <eos> \n",

After extensive searching, I haven't been able to find the average GPA by department at the University. I have seen guesstimates for engineering, and at some point The Michigan Daily ran an article with the worst and the best, but that list was quite select. I emailed them for information on where they obtained their stats but never got a reply. Does anyone have any idea what the average GPA for the Department of Chemistry, Computer Science, or MCDB Department are? <eos> \n",

I'm the type of guy who **actually** works and expects some degree of the same effort from the person who I'm working with. My issue, however, is that I need a bit of help starting off, but once I get into the work and have a good idea of what I need to do, I don't stop until I finish with my deliverable.

Here's the email: Dear all, This morning, representatives from the Chez Betty Team, CSE, CoE, and the Provost’s Office, including Provost Paul Courant, met to discuss the future of Chez Betty. We came together with the same goal, “How do we enable Betty to continue while meeting appropriate state and federal requirements?” We are thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement that gives Betty a path to continue operating and addresses the administration’s concerns. Betty will close temporarily at the end of the term in order to incorporate, obtain insurance and a state retail food establishment license, and handle various other compliance needs. We plan to reopen as soon as possible after that, once we have all of these things in place--hopefully by Betty’s next birthday in early July. This outstanding resolution happened because so many of you--students, alumni, staff, faculty, and deans--reached out and made your voices heard. We are grateful for your support as well as the partnership of the Provost’s Office for responding in such a timely and positive manner. This solution reaffirms Michigan’s support for student-driven problem solving and entrepreneurship. It’s also a reflection of what the North Campus community (and the central administration) can accomplish when we come together. We wish everyone the best of luck with the end of the term. Forever Go Blue (and Go Betty!), -Brad, Pat,  Zakir and Frances Mueller (Provost’s Office) Edit: For those out of the loop, check out the [first post]([url link] and the [second post]([url link] about Chez Betty. <eos> \n",

I get the sentiment and the idea of a big thread for all these questions seems good in theory, but in reality no one is going through those threads (or at least not nearly as many people as the front page). It’s not like this subreddit gets spammed with posts, there’s only ever a few posts a day, so I don’t think it’s a huge problem to have a couple more. I personally have no issue with people coming to the subreddit and posting their own questions as a separate post, and I think that’d be a lot more helpful to them than the megathread approach.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a freshman currently taking Math 115 and EECS 183. For next semester, which one of the 3 in the title should I take? Do I need to take two of them at the same time? I have to take one course for a learning community and I also have to take a first-year writing course, so that leaves me with only two spots. And also another sort of unrelated question, would it be better to minor in Business with CompSci? I want to minor in history, though.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Number of credits or duration of time spent in college? I should have enough credits to get junior status (55) before I even start college (over at UofM Dearborn). Have a 34 act as well. Also have all required classes for the CoE transfer. The winter term application is due october 1, before my first semester is even done. The Fall term is due February 1st though, which gives me only a semester under m belt to send to Umich. I'm assuming my application would do piss-poor if I sent it for the winter term. But how would the Fall term application fare? I'm guessing I'll have around 70+ credits then. I know I would have the motivation to get a 3.85+ gpa at dearborn. How would my chances be? Edit: Im only confident because I have taken high level courses at Dearborn and have fared very well. also currently a high schooler. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My roommate and I were walking home from our internships today and we struck a conversation as we passed by Elbel Field. We purposefully leased a house on South Campus this year because we were a house of eight active guys who enjoy playing pick-up sports and wanted to be close to field space. The University ended up fencing off the whole park and closed everything down until the summer because they didn't want to pay people to staff the field. Now I can't play soccer or anything when I get off work because they lease the space to look youth organizations. Does this piss anyone else off? Maybe this is being fueled by my preexisting hatred for Rec Sports (another issue entirely) but I feel that a part of my tuition should be reimbursed for them taking back some of the resources to which I was expecting access. **TL,DR - I want access to Elbel Field and feel that the University is cutting corners to make a quick buck.** <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey everyone! I am currently a freshman at the University of Michigan Dearborn CECS. It has been my dream, like many, to attend Michigan since I was a kid. When I applied for Fall 14, I was deferred than denied. I chose to attend Dearborn for the sole purpose to transfer to Ann Arbor. Well here I am today. I just completed my first semester of college at Dearborn and have begun my application to transfer to Ann Arbor's College of Engineering to study Aerospace. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to approach the application or process as a whole. Yes I have great grades, and all the engineering pre-requisites will be completed before Fall '15. What can I do to get my foot in the door? Please feel free to PM me if you can spare a minute. Thank you SO much, and always, Go Blue!  <eos> \n",

Trying to save a few dollars, I would rather drive down. However, I am without a car and in the process of looking for a road trip crew. Basically, does anyone plan on heading down and have an extra spot in their car? I would be more than happy to cover my share of the gas and driving. So with that, PM me if you have a spot. <eos> \n",

Originally I had declared a minor in LGBTQ Studies but recently learned of a minor (CASC) that can lead to preferred admissions into the school of social work. If I were to keep both minors, I would need to take 2 more classes than I would if I dropped LGBTQ and stayed with the CASC minor because some of my LGBTQ courses count for CASC but we aren't allowed to share courses between minors. Should I drop LGBTQ Studies and just focus on CASC or would having LGBTQ Studies help my grad school admissions at all? <eos> \n",

I don't live in Ann Arbor so I don't know where everything is or what jobs/places are worth working at. I don't want to be stuck in some rundown place that sucks or is far away. The job list is here - [url link] I have no experience in anything technical so it has to be a baseline job. I'm preferably looking for something that will put me in a good spot for the next couple of years, as well as relevant to my major (biomedical engineering at the moment) Also, would it be better to work for the University or a non-university employer?

We're both in to sports and music and the usual things. We're easygoing, non-psychotic, and just looking to get an idea of what life at Michigan is like.  PM me if you want more info.

I'm currently in 280, and we haven't done too much yet. Project 1 was cake, but that is pretty expected I'd imagine.  Would it be wise to take 281, Physics 240, and Math 216 (Calc IV) all at once? I've heard 281 is the class that makes or breaks a CS major, so I'm going to try my best to give myself a semi-easy semester so I can focus on 281 as much as possible. What would you guys recommend? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I got around the average on the other two midterms and my labs and hw score is almost an 100%. However, with the final being worth 30% of the grade I'm almost positive I'll get a C-. Since I am in engineering will I be forced to retake it? Has anyone been in a similar situation with a core course? <eos> \n",

You can type directly into the box, or you can paste text from another source.\". I'm confused because the last supplemental essay and the common app one are pretty much the same question.  Also, I applied here previously as a freshman applicant but didn't get in and the writing prompts are the same for transfer students as well; could I just submit the same essays again?  <eos> \n",

So I have a friend who wants to transfer into the college of engineering, but he has, as of last semester 52 credits and will have around 68 at the end of this semester over 85 by the time he finishes his requirements for transferring this upcoming fall. The CoE cross-transfer website says that a  *\"\"Cross-Campus transfer students are those who have completed college coursework on the Ann Arbor campus only and have not exceeded 55 credit hours, excluding AP or dual enrollment credit. \"\"* I cannot find any information online about if a person could transfer if they had more than the credits mentioned here. The only slightly relevant information I could find is that \"cross-college\" transfer students are not allowed to bring in more than 54 credits.  Does anyone have any information/idea as to if he can still transfer. Any comment/advice is really appreciated. Thank you once again.  Edit: He set up an appointment with an advisor, I was just wondering if anyone had any experience with it. Or had any helpful tips.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Well, I've got to say first that I'm not a super smart guy. However, I recently just declared my major as Econ and I'm worried about the difficulty of the courses. I asked a few friends about it and they told me they have heard nasty things about some of the classes, Econ 401 and 404 specifically. I already had 101 and 102 finished before entering UofM so those are no worry. I completed Calc 1 at a dinky community college this past summer, that has got me a bit concerned. Econ 401 is the one that has got me most worried because that is the required course all Econ majors must take, I plan to take it this winter. **I know it is very fast-paced, but how is the difficulty of the content and is the class very math-heavy?** Thank you very, very much for the help! <eos> \n",

According to the OFA, the [in-state cost of on campus housing]([url link] for grad students makes up a solid third or so of the total cost of attendance, \"based on the Standard Meal Plan\" (see the footnote on the website). I've got plenty of practice cooking budget meals for myself and I'd rather do that to save money...is there a way to get off the meal plan, but still live at Northwood, so I don't have to pay fourteen thousand dollars? 2. Are the rates for the 2-bedrooms posted on the [Northwood website]([url link] per person, or per unit? I.e. if I was rooming with someone in the two-bedroom, two-level northwood 1 apartment, is that $596 for both of us together, or would we each pay $596? Sorry that these are really specific questions, but I emailed the folks at Northwood a few days ago and still haven't gotten a response, so I thought I'd hit up reddit. <eos> \n",

I'm also not in any AP classes. Michigan is my dream school and I would love to go there, but I'm scared my chances are already too slim considering how hard it is to get into UM. Would applying to Michigan be a waste of time or should I still go for it in my last 2 years?

            "<bos> Before going into this post, I'd just like to mention that I'm not trying to come off as a \"rosshole\" or anything of the like. Unfortunately, I've applied to prospective transfer schools. My schools require that I submit an official transcript as part of their evaluation process. When I was looking over the \"unofficial transcript\" after submitting my official transcripts through the school to my prospective transfer universities, I noticed that it said on the transcript that I was a LSA Undeclared. Because I am a Freshman pre-admit and chose to enroll my first year here under LSA, I'm sure that is the reason why. However, my transfer essays were very heavily business-based. My question is, since my transfer applications don't indicate anywhere that I'm a transfer specifically from the Ross Business School, how would I indicate that this is the truth? I'm not trying to say that Ross is better than LSA (or any other Michigan school for that case), but because of the business-nature of my essays, I believe that it would hold more weight if somewhere in my applications it indicated that I was trying to transfer from the business school here. If anyone has any knowledge of whether or not it's indicated somewhere, or ideas of which I could do so, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. <eos> \n",

I took the SAT and scored 2300. I'm also a national athlete. However, I have compulsory national service(conscription) which ends somewhere around Nov 2017. What are the chances of my application being successful based on my SAT score and what other exams/tests should I take to boost my chances? For those who are more familiar with the British modelled education system, I scored 6 distinctions in my GCE O'Levels while I messed up my A'levels really badly.

If there is anyone here that has some knowledge about the admission process for Ross, can these people give me advice on what I should do during my freshman year to increase my value as an applicant? What extracurriculars should I do, for example? I know that the standard answer is an idealistic \"Just show that you are passionate about something!\", but **I am looking for practical, utilitarian advice**. Are there things besides getting good grades, and doing certain extracurricular activities that will help my chances?

            "<bos> I will be in an economy double in MoJo for MRADS. However recently, my immune system has gotten really weak so my body is really susceptible to infections I could get from others around me. My physician recommended I get a single instead of the economy double since it would help protect me a little better.  Is the only way to switch rooms from an economy double to a single to find someone willing to switch with me or go on the waitlist once we move in? Or is there a way to contact housing and let them know that I have a health condition that would make living in a double difficult for me? I think I read something about letting housing know if you have a disability but my case is a little different from that... I do have a letter from the physician that I could email to housing but I'm not sure if it would be of any help.  Please let me know if there's anything I could do in advance before move in day! Or if you know if there could be any exceptions in a case like mine? Thanks! <eos> \n",

The EIC has been tapping ~75 sugar maples on the property and making syrup on-site for at least 15 years now, and every year have a small pancake breakfast to thank the volunteers who helped collect sap.  The EIC's Pancake Breakfast is open to the public this year, for the first time ever -- and we've got about 7 gallons of our maple syrup to share on pancakes, sausage, eggs and even ice cream! There will be some environment-themed exhibits set up around the dining area for you to browse in between helpings.  If you come and you see a 20-something girl with brown hair, glasses,and some kind of animal-themed shirt, it might be me. :)  More info: [url link] Facebook event: [url link] Hope to see some of you there! <eos> \n",

But a lot of why I am goes way past exam anxiety or worrying about failing college. Like it’s years of stuff and I’m not sure them being college student focused would effect what they are able to handle if that makes sense.

            "<bos> I made the decision to rush this semester, hoping it would be a good way of meeting people, getting involved on campus and having a good social life to balance out my academic courseload. I rushed several houses during the open house period, and so far I have not received any invites back. Since open houses are over, I take this to mean I struck out everywhere. Does this happen frequently? I tried to rush as many houses as possible and meet as many brothers as I could, but time is limited. And even with the other clubs I have applied for, such as a dance team I've auditioned for, I've heard nothing. It's really hard to meet people, since most of the other students in my classes are upperclassmen who already have friend groups and probably do not want a freshman to bother them. Does anyone else have any experience with this? What do I do if I completely strike out during rush? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Alright I just got back my second Math 116 test and I did pretty terrible, 49/100, which is about a C according to the scale. My first test I got a 71/100, a B+. Do the final grades follow the scales or is there a more general scale at the end of the course? My major (CS) requires me to get at least a C on Math 116 and I'm pretty worried right now that I might not be able to complete the requirement Thanks <eos> \n",

I'm signed up for the class next semester and I have no knowledge of either of those things. For those of you who have already taken the class, how important is it to know databases and SQL? Will we have time to learn it while taking the class? The only course prerequisite listed for the class is EECS 281, and I've satisfied it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi fellow wolverines! Pre med track here. I'm taking 140 this semester and I don't know why but it's causing me to sweat bullets. I had the option to take 135 but I chose 140 because I really wanted to learn something. Plenty of people said 135 was just plug and chug the entire semester. Also I just wanted to learn physics without the health perspective thing, and toying with the idea of transfering to the college of engineering.  Any feedback from you guys that took it recently? I know Yuri is an awesome professor, very cool dude. What is it about the exams that make their average around a 65%? Tips tricks and anything else worth mentioning that could calm me down a little bit. Thanks guys.  <eos> \n",

A good friend of mine had his Ninja tipped and keyed as well.  I don't understand, is it fun to damage motorcycles or something? Either way, if someone knows an owner of a Yellow Honda (Hornet, I think), please let me know. I have a witness pointing towards that motorcycle owner. <eos> \n",

I want to start going to the gym regularly but without somewhere to safely store my lap top that’s been fairly impossible. The lockers at the gym are not big enough to store my back pack.

Do I just apply as if I were a normal freshman? What do I do about guidance counselor and teacher recommendations? Do they really want to see 10 year old high school transcripts?

            "<bos> Hey, all. Was accepted into the SW PhD program at UMich and am heading there this fall. Super stoked.  I was looking at housing options and it looks as though Northwood I/II are the most accessible (as far as price goes) on-campus options for graduate students. I've been reading through some past Reddit threads from other prospective graduate students but they're all pretty old.  Have been looking at rental options in the neighboring areas and rent seems to be pretty similar/slightly higher than the campus housing options. Anything I should take note of? I didn't have the opportunity to dorm during undergrad so part of me wants to be in a more socially accessible space. Any thoughts from current UMich students? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm going to be graduating from hs in about a month, I've been accepted for the fall semester, and I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into: 1: If anyone here is in the M-Bio program, what's it like? Is it worth the early start? 2: How rigorous is the freshman coursework for the EEB program? I'm coming from an IB school (if anyone knows what that's like), is it more or less involved? 3: I've read that about half of all incoming freshmen are hused in North Campus, but I'd like to go into Mosher Jordan because it's about 10 minutes away from the intro science classes; how likely am I to get into Mosher Jordan if I prefer it on my housing app? 4: How many of you take/took up a part time job during the year to help pay for food? 5: How psyched should I be to go to U of M this fall? <eos> \n",

As a somewhat avid cyclist, and as the weather lately has been absolute crap, I'd love to be able to train indoors.

I purchased a 75 block meal plan for this term, so I should now have 90 meals for the semester. If I were to go and swipe my Mcard in a dining hall right now, the total would read \"14\". I thought that the 15 meals from last semester would just be added to the 75 from this semester and display a combined total of 90. Instead, it appears the total will display from last semester until it runs down to 0, then it will become 75. Is this how it works? <eos> \n",

I used piazza and posted on there for a class saying that the SLC is trash quality but I Said it out of anger and then realized I couldn’t delete the comment.

A lot of other incoming freshmen got their housing contracts today and they all seemed to be central campus dorms (s quad, west quad, markley, etc.).

I was wondering what your opinions were on taking these three classes together, and nothing else. I understand 281 and 370 share a lot of due dates (though a peer adviser told me they were trying to change that), but, speaking from experience with Eng 101 and EECS 280, I've been pretty good at starting coding projects early (to procrastinate other work...) and I haven't had much trouble in EECS classes so far. I know this schedule is not ideal, but with only 12 credits I'd have a lot of time to complete the work. Do you think it's manageable? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> To make a long story short I currently go to michigan state while my sister goes to the university of michigan. My parents have been wanting me to try and transfer to U of M since its generally a better school and closer to home. My sister transferred there from depaul university her sophmore year with a 26 on her ACT and a 4.0 cumilative gpa in high school. I on the other hand am halfway through my freshmen year and got a 1170 on the sat and graduated high school with a 3.5. My question is basically is it worth applying to u of m even though im more than likely not gonna get in? I know that it can't hurt to apply but I really dont want to write multiple essays and pay an application fee just to end up getting denied. I do know that after you get a certain amount of college credits universities dont look at your high school scores/gpa I currently have 43 credits and I do have a pretty good personal statement that can back up why my grades/test scores arent up to standard during high school and my sister is willing to help me with the application process. Any thoughts on what I should do? Thanks! <eos> \n",

Now my plan sadly needs to change again and I kinda need to get another permission from that department. I am not sure if that will look super weird. Will I be noticed from the department like \"this student got too many permissions that gone dropped.\" <eos> \n",

The Michigan Cycling team is a Club Sport who competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference. Other teams in our conference include MSU, OSU, Notre Dame, Indiana, Wisconsin, Purdue, Illinois, Case Western, Louisville, Northwestern, Cincinatti, Marquette, Miami (NTM), and a bevy of other small schools. Our conference also features a few schools that consider cycling a varsity sport including Marian and Lindenwood. The kit order is once again live and this year they're added a couple more options. These are the same exact uniforms that the team will be racing in next spring.  More information about the team can be found here: [url link] Prices do tend to run a bit high, but such is the nature of being a small fish in the big pond of paying university royalties and the like. Any proceeds go towards helping get team member's to races and most importantly nationals. Also, we have switched vendors this year, and expect a massive step up in quality, as well as slightly reduced prices, so this is the year to order if you've been hesitant in the past! The order closes on October 15th, and the kits will be delivered to you in mid-November. Please note that because this is a custom order, there is no returns. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.  KIT ORDER LINK: [url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I'm an incoming international freshman at UofM, and I'm desperately in need of help with some stuff regarding my arrival at the university. Some background info: I'll be arriving at the States and doing my immigration thingy at Chicago O' Hare International Airport at 10 AM, and then I'll have to catch a flight to Detroit International Airport (transit time is 3 hours) which will land at around 3 PM. 1. Will the immigration procedure take much time? 3 hours doesn't seem like much, and I'm afraid of the possibility of missing my next flight to Detroit. What can I do then? 2. When I arrive at DTW (assuming at 3 PM), where exactly on campus do I need to get to? (I'm probably planning to take the MichiganFlyer, but if there's a better option, please please please let me know. If it's too much of a hassle, I can just take a taxi instead.) 3. I'm going to order a lot of stuff from Amazon, and I want them shipped preferably right before I get to the university. I've put the shipping address as my dorm address (Bursley Hall). Is this okay? Thank you so much for your help! <eos> \n",

I'm a little scared if one of them ever gets stolen. I really want my PS4 for video games, Netflix, and blu Ray, and am bringing my Wii U primarily for Super Smash Bro's. Leaving my PS3 and Wii at home in NY.  Also, when I travel back to NY for the holidays, how safe is it leaving my consoles in my dorm? Is there a place I can lock it in storage on campus?

I would do almost anything just to get in I love this college that much. So I was wondering if you guys can help me out. Right now after one semester I have a 3.5. I will be signing up for classes soon and I think I want to transfer this year. the reason why is that way I have two chances to get in instead of one. I would like to know what I should do to get in. If anyone can help me by telling me what I have to do that would be great. Thank you! :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi everyone, I'm a Dutch ME master student from TU Delft. I'll be spending six months (begin feb to end of july) at the University of Michigan doing research at the aerospace dept. I've never moved outside of the Netherlands, let alone to another continent. Does anyone have any recommendations about housing for that period? From what I've read visiting researchers have the lowest priority in university housing, are there any options besides craigslist? What are areas to avoid while looking for housing? Anything else I should know? I've got Dutch-US dual citizenship in case that matters. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm currently a high school student (sorry if I'm posting in the wrong subreddit!), and I'm planning to take a U of M math class next year, as I completed Calc BC this year. I'm struggling to decide what math course I should take; I think that I'm going to take 285, but I'm not sure. Does anyone have recommendations for certain classes, and if so, professors (side note: I'm planning to take classes above 215, and apparently we are discouraged from taking 215 or below)?

            "<bos> A friend and I are renting a house on Miller Ave about half a mile from Main and are looking for a 3rd roommate for the 2014-2015 school year (Aug to Aug). It is a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house with lots of parking and a storage shed (I'm going to keep a motorcycle in there, but it's big enough for a lot more). We're going for 3 roommates because one of the rooms is a bit small, and we'd rather that be an office/workroom/music room.  About us: My friend and I are both 4th year engineering PhD students. We'll be driving/biking/riding/busing into North Campus pretty much every day. He has a cat, is relatively quiet, vegetarian, French, and he is a joy to be around. I'm a big movie person, techie, gamer, absolutely not a vegetarian, and beer drinker. We're both very considerate about noise, cleanliness, and house rules. Neither of us are huge party people, but might have people over every once in a while. I go between hosting board game nights, LANs, beer tastings, and movie nights at my current place.  The rent is $800/month/person, and I'm guessing utilities(gas, electric, water)and internet will be no more than 50-80 over that per person.  What we're looking for in a roommate: clean, fun, and considerate. Gender doesn't matter. If you have a pet, you'll split the landlord's pet fee with my friend (it's 240/year if you have any pets). When we signed the lease, we added a clause to add a 3rd roommate at a later date. If you're interested, PM me and I can send you some pictures of the place. We can also arrange for you to go see the place with the landlord. Lastly, we can meet up for a beer to make sure we're all compatible as people.  Cheers! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everybody, My friend and I are both going to be on campus this summer and we brought our cars. We've also both bought Orange passes and park on North campus. ________________________________________ However, there's a few stupid rules that I'm wondering about. The first of which being that you cannot park on North campus Orange lots for more than 48 hours.  My roommate actually just emailed parking services about this, because we are storing our cars on these lots overnight, and they said that yes, every 48 hours you must move to a different Orange lot.. ________________________________________ There are two Orange lots right near each other on North, so technically we can just move from lot to lot.. but it takes honestly about an hour and a half just to do this, we live pretty far away on South, but we HAVE to park on North because you're not allowed to store your cars overnight on the South lots. ________________________________________ Does anybody have experience with this? How does the parking police check to see if your car has been on a specific lot longer than 48 hours? We both have to have our cars on campus, and we use them about once a week. So having to run over to North campus to drive our cars 100 feet to the other lot seems a little stupid. ________________________________________ Do the parking police honestly check this? Or do they just check to see if you have an Orange pass in your windshield? Any insight to parking with these orange student passes would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys, I have the opportunity to visit the UofM from April-May. I live in London, UK, so this would mean quite a lot to me and would be a great opportunity to meet academics in a different continent. Unfortunately at the moment I'm seeing a nurse several times per week in the UK, and this would need to continue in the USA. Obviously this would require some form of health insurance, but having never lived abroad this is a concept quite foreign to me. Is there a facility for this at the University of Michigan, and if so do you know how I'd access it as a foreign temporary student? I'm a UK national currently enrolled in a PhD programme in London, UK. Cheers, thanks for your help. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently finishing my freshman year at a mid-size private university on the east coast and have already been accepted to LSA. Umich is the better option for me financially but I'm still undecided because of a few concerns. If you guys could answer a few questions or just provide me with some advice as a transfer, I would really appreciate it! Concerns: -Are large classes really competitive? Is it hard to do well? -I'm looking at majoring in poli sci and doubling it with either a communications or economics degree. Is that hard to do at umich as a transfer? How hard is it to get into the Ross Minor? -Is the large size of the school ever overwhelming? -I'm from Michigan so I'm familiar with Ann Arbor, but now that I go to school near a large East coast city, I'm concerned that A2 would be boring. Does it ever feel like a bubble? -Is it hard to integrate into the student body as a transfer? -What are some housing options now that it's so close to the next year? Any info on Umich greek life? I'm currently involved at my school. I know a lot of these questions might be better for an advisor, but they couldn't really answer these because I don't have a personal advisor yet. I have to decide soon so I thought I'd try to get a student perspective too. Edit: Also, how's the networking at u of m? I know the network is large, but how involved are alumni in the network? Is it easy to get some person-to-person networking with alumni? <eos> \n",

I'm currently in LSA, and I'll be taking Calc III, FYWR, and 3 credits of humanities, and 4 credits of a language. I'd like to give myself a first semester that eases me into college life, but I also want to prevent from shutting myself out of the opportunity to transfer to CoE. If I'm comfortable with my first semester in LSA and want to transfer, in order to meet transfer requirements, I'd have to take CHEM 130/125/126, Physics 140/141, and ENGR 101 together in the Winter term. If it matters, I have AP credit for Calc 115, Calc 116, and PHYSICS 240, so maybe that gives me a little padding when making my decisions. Is that Winter term schedule do-able? Thanks!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey, I'm currently a Math major at UT Austin, wanting to be a Computer Science major. I have a 3.97 GPA, but I didn't get in this semester at a transfer to the CS department at UT. I'm planning on applying again next semester, but just in case, I'm looking at other schools. Currently, I'm looking at UIUC, UMich, UCLA, UWashington, Berkeley, Cornell, Columbia, and UPenn. Anyway my point is, how difficult is it to transfer from UT to UMich as a computer science major with a 3.97 GPA? I have about 46 credit hours here, and I'm done with Calculus and a semester of physics with AP credit for statistics, non Calc based physics, and computer science. I'll be taking Linear Algebra and Probability this summer and Physics Electricity and Magnetism in the fall along with differential equations. The rest of my classes are just core classes. I also have an internship at Microsoft, a smaller web development company, and I'm working on a tech startup with a grad student and professor here at UT. It'll break my heart to leave Austin, but I need a computer science degree, and I think UMich is a fantastic school and a great opportunity for me to do that. So, what do you think? Do I have a good shot? <eos> \n",

I'm part of an Ann Arbor based concert planning group called New Beat Happening, and we are organizing a battle of the bands event for local bands to take place in January. Right now we are accepting recordings of bands playing. The idea is to review these recordings and choose the top few to perform live at the event.  The winner of the battle gets to open for a larger concert we are holding in April.  New Beat Happening is funded by UUAP. In the past, we've brought to Ann Arbor bands like Broken Social Scene, and we helped put up the Lupe Fiasco concert last semester. I'm trying to get the word out. If you are in a band (or you know a local band) and are interested in this, please upload a recording of your stuff somewhere and mail it to nbh.battle@aol.com  **TL;DR** [Here's our promotional poster]([url link] [We also have a tumblr!]([url link] <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a rising sophomore and I'm debating between CS and EE. I've tried eecs 270 and absolutely hated it cause of how it messed with my extracurriculars at night, seeing that you were only able to work on labs only at the eecs building and when there was someone supervising. I did well in engr 101 but thought it was okay in terms of enjoyment. I'm now considering electrical engineering because I always enjoyed physics in high school and math and thought that would transfer well to 215.  What are your inputs on this? Do you like EE? How was the workload?How did the workload compare to that of eecs 280? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey I decided to try the UofM community before I try the Ann Arbor community at large seeing as I'm still a student here (going to be a 5th year senior though). So I used to be a pretty avid rock climber and I want to get it going again with a membership over at planet rock, only issue is I'm out a consistent partner and a consistent ride... I haven't been climbing in over a year but I have about 4 solid years under my belt, lead, trad, indoors, outdoors all that good stuff, AND I have lead certification at planet rock (assuming its still valid, that was two years ago) which means I can totally belay anyone on lead or top-rope and I have all my own gear (which can be shared although its really only useful outdoors).  A little more about myself in case you need to know - I'm about to be a 5th year senior in Computer Science Engineering, I work full-time at a local tech startup here in Ann Arbor, I'm super chill, and like to have a good time so a refreshing drink at a bar after the gym is totally an option.  **Please pm me if you're interested in climbing at planet rock at all! Skill level doesn't matter!** I'm extremely rusty myself and will probably be top-roping for a while anyway plus climbing is one of those things people tend to get good at fast (i.e if you've never done it before but want to I'm still down with having you as a partner).  I want to go regularly but if you think you'd be down to go every once in a while I'd still like the opportunity (a car is probably necessary however)  Good luck on exams everyone - my last one is Thursday so I'm going to be busy myself for a while.  Edit: I'm totally willing to pay for gas btw. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Sorry for yet another housing thread. Just wanted to get some real feedback from current and past students. So I'll start out with the things I've heard. From what I've heard, West Quad is one of the best, and I've stayed in South Quad before and I really liked it. I've also heard that East Quad is pretty nice as well. I know that housing assignments are random and that having Freshmen living in these dorms is extremely rare, but is there any specific set of criteria in my housing application that could maybe give better chances of being placed there? That being said, I got into MRADS and I'm very likely to accept my spot so I'll most likely be living in MoJo, which has just been renovated and I've also heard good things about. tl;dr - Feel free to share any thoughts, tips, or experiences regarding housing at UMich. <eos> \n",

As far as I know, most rents have a 12 month lease so they do not suit me. I am an EECS student but I have been told to look for housing in Central Campus.  What are good options for housing between September and April? Both 9 month lease and month-to-month are ok. Thanks <eos> \n",

I don't have a specific person that I'd like to room with, but I also really don't want to be paired with another cismale. I'd hate to deny someone the opportunity to have a nonconforming roommate, though--has anyone been in GILE? Should I apply, or is it best to stick with normal housing? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> 5th year (well 5 1/2) in EE, doing my MDE this semester (EECS 452 plus the techcomm497+EECS496) and 461 to fulfill upper-level flex-tech. I found out, based on being a transfer and studying abroad, I still need 1 more 300-level or higher tech class to fulfill some CTP taken at UM-AA requirement that my transfer credits don't cover.  Most likely alley now (to not bump myself from 12 to 16 eecs credits) is doing a directed study for one credit; anyone have experience or advice on how to go about this? As a transfer (and a struggling student at the beginning) I don't have a ton of faculty relationships, but I do have a professor who has had me twice as a student (not strong...but definitely present) as well as one who knows me outside the classroom. Both do research in areas I'm interested in working; should I look into current research and have a project idea in mind to ask them about their assistance, or go blind and ask if they're working on anything? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi Guys.  I am a current freshman engineering student who is looking to transfer to lsa next semester.  I am still exploring majors, and am curious as to how the economics major is. I went to a technical academy for engineering in high school , but also took classes in other subjects. I really enjoyed economics and biology, and those are the fields I am currently interested in.  So to those econ students, how are you liking the major? I know it is hard, everything is here.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi! I got accepted into University of Michigan and am highly considering going there. I understand how the semester system works (very simple which is good :)), but I was wondering, how accurate is the credit hour number in terms of workload (i.e. are all 4.0 cred classes similar workload to each other, same with 3.0 and 2.0)? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm in my 300 level humanities class through the college of engineering. Unfortunately, the class has turned out to be more time-consuming than I originally thought due to my heavy courseload. Does anyone know if the pass/fail deadline has not passed yet? Also, is it possible to take the 300 level humanities pass/fail and still have it count towards the requirement? Thank you! <eos> \n",

Can anyone point me in the right direction as to how I can find out over the next semester if it's a right path for me? I've looked up various clubs on Maize Pages, but I'm not sure which of them still exist/which have faded out of existence. Thank you so much! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I am an undergrad engineering student. I have lived in university housing for the past three years with the same roommate that I know really well. My roommate is graduating at the end of the winter semester, and I need to find housing--and a roommate--for next year. I am worried about continuing with university housing because I'm extremely nervous about roomming with a stranger in a one-bedroom Northwood apartment. I'm thinking about living in off-campus housing for the 4th year, but there's a chance that I may graduate early at the end of Fall 2016...unless I want to do grad school in Winter 2017...really not sure. My question is: If I looked into an apartment for next year on North campus like at Willowtree, what are the complications of roomming for Fall only...and finding a somebody to take my spot in the Winter? How hard is it to find other people who are looking for Winter-only sublets--if there are any? Is there a way I can live off campus for just the Fall semester if I wanted to...? Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm looking for graduate programs, and it seems that University of Michigan has the best research in my area (EE), but I'm curious about how much fun I would have outside of work here. I'm used to the undergraduate social life where you get thrown in to a dorm with a bunch of other people studying the same things, and friendships just form out of thin air with no effort whatsoever. I'm aware it probably won't be that easy at graduate school, but how drastic is the change here? Will I have to resign to going out once a week to meet with acquaintances, or is it common to develop a strong friend circle here? Do graduate students usually end up living together or close to each other? Also, this may be a long shot, but is there any sort of hustle dancing group around the university? I've heard that Detroit also has a strong techno scene, although I don't know how realistic it is to get there and back on a frequent basis. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm a prospective Econ Major attending U of M next year. I took AP econ in HS and it was a breeze (got A's and 5's on the tests without trying too hard), but my AP credit doesn't let me place out of the course according to the website. 1) Is there any way to place out of the course without IB HL Econ? Like a placement test? or just badgering the department? 2) How bored will I be if I end up taking the 101/102 course? Does it go significantly beyond AP? Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a high school student, currently enrolled in a dual enrollment program where I take classes at Oakland Community College in Michigan while I'm high school. Basically the program is designed so that I'll get my associates degree and my high school diploma (for free) at the same time, technically a year after my senior year but it's designed a certain way to make it work out the right credits I'll need for high school as well being able to around 62 credits with me to a different college I choose to go to. Now I won't be doing applying until next fall, and I mention this since I'll have an abundance of credits (44-62 depends on what schools accept what) I'll only need to do about 2 years of school after I have finished this program. One of the schools I was considering was U of M Dearborn, I have a decent chance of getting accepted (little to no chance of getting into Ann Arbor) but I have heard from other seniors that if you go to Dearborn or Flint campuses, after two years you're able to go to Ann Arbor for your remaining years. I wasn't sure how exactly it works, if it's an automatic optional thing or you have to reach a certain GPA at flint or Dearborn or depending on your major. Two majors I'm considering are Computer Science (Programming in particular) or Nursing. Would I have a chance at transferring from Dearborn to Ann Arbor even with the additional credits? Should I maybe call the Dearborn or Ann Arbor campus to get more information?  tl;dr I will attend a university with 50-62 college credits, I wanna be able to attend Dearborn and possibly transferring Ann Arbor, how does it work and does it work for my situation?  <eos> \n",

I figure if I have to do a work study I might as well do one that'll benefit me academically and career wise. Since I'm a new student I was going to apply to the UROP Changing Gears program.  nbsp; My question was about one of the questions they ask on the application. The question is, \"What kind(s) of research opportunities are you looking for and why? Give at least 1-2 examples.\"  nbsp; I just wanted some clarification. Is the question asking me to like make up a research project like say \"I'd like to do research on changing voting demographics.\" That's obviously a very simplified example but is that the kind of thing they're asking? Or are they looking more for something like \"I'm looking for research in the field of economics\"  nbsp; Also if anyone who has been in the program before has any advice or suggestions I'd love to hear from them. Thanks ahead of time.   <eos> \n",

I really want to take 381 first semester of Senior Year, as well as 477. If this is, what recommendations do you have?  If I take 370, I have 19 remaining upper level CS courses to take(as well as 16 Upper Level Technical Electives, but I think they overlap). Does this seem like a good plan? Should I hold off on 481 and make it my MDE? If so, what should I replace it with? Thanks! <eos> \n",

The Kitchen has hardwood floors, plenty of counter top space, a dishwasher and waste disposal. The bedroom is a good size and I will be keeping my bunk bed there so you will not need to provide your own. Dresser and some closet space are also available. My room mate will be staying in Ann Arbor for the summer, so you will not have the apartment to yourself. No parking available. It's a great location between Main and S. State, right next to Seva and less than a block from Mani. You'll be close to campus and walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants. Please message me if you're interested, I'll give you the address and we'll arrange a time you can come see the place. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Here's a link to the [article]([url link] on mlive. I know NeglectedWalrus already posted it but I found the acceptance rate particularly interesting. Going from a 50% acceptance rate to under 25% in just eight years seems absolutely crazy. It's understandable that admissions are getting more competitive since more and more students go to college each year, but the change is far greater than I would have guessed.  This got me wondering how this compared to other universities' experiences.  * MSU: Fall 2017 is 71.5% and Fall 2010 was 70.0% ([souce]([url link] * OSU: Fall 2017 is 43.8% and Fall 2010 was 61.9% ((2017 [source]([url link] and 2010 [source]([url link] * USC: Fall 2018 is 12.9% and Fall 2010 was 24.3% (2018 [source]([url link] and 2010 [source]([url link] * UVA: Fall 2018 is 27.3% and Fall 2010 was 32.6% ([source]([url link] * UCLA: Fall 2017 is 16.1% and Fall 2010 was 22.7% (2017 [source]([url link] and 2010 [source]([url link] The comparison doesn't directly mean much, but I'd argue it shows Michigan's administration has done an excellent job continuing to improve the universities image and continuing to make it competitive. And MSU appears as a bit of an outlier but it can be explained by their enrollment numbers. They've started accepting far more people each year to increase their enrollment size. I'm guessing they're trying to grow their class size quicker than they're trying to become more selective (something some would debate Michigan should do).

You'll put up a post on University Of Michigan Class of 2016 Facebook page saying \"Selling Econ 101 - Message me for price\" and if you're lucky, someone will see your post and message you back. But if you're like most people, your post will be buried by other similar posts within minutes. And BOOM. There goes your hope of getting rid of your 50 pound chem textbook that you paid $200 for. Now, it's probably going to chill in your dorm until you throw it out half-way through the semester. \" As a result, couple of friends and I developed this: [Website]([url link] [iOS]([url link] [Android]([url link]  We got a lot of awesome feedback last time I posted on here and we used it to completely redo the website.

My entire backpack was pulled from the car. This included the following contents: (i) 13\" Macbook pro registered to UMPD. (ii) assorted zippered bags with lightning cables + other electronic miscellany. (iii) yellow klean kanteen with sport top. (iv) notebooks with handwritten contents, including a small red hardcover notebook. (v) paperwork in yellow campus mail envelopes. Naturally, as a grad student, the stolen Macbook with its dissertation contents and the handwritten work I had in the pack are the most devastating losses. I would really appreciate any help at all on this: leads that might result in partial recovery of the pack's contents, advice on what you've done in such situations, etc. Thank you so all much. I didn't think I could ever feel like simultaneously puking AND weeping. The whole thing's put me through the wringer. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Greetings. I have posted in this sub a couple of times before as to my academic situation. I have been reinstated to the College of Engineering to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering. I will be taking Chem 230, Math 215, and one intellectual breadth course. Unfortunately, despite passing Calc III with a B+ in community college, the course was just evaluated by Michigan and will not transfer. I am required to earn a 3.3 this semester to regain good standing in the College of Engineering, as well as fulfill a bevy of other requirements. 1. Besides spending hours (many, many hours) per week studying, a skill I have been cultivating and improving, what other steps should I take to learn the material? I have incorporated office hours and group study sessions into my repertoire in the last couple semesters, and I imagine these will continue to be useful. Any specific study strategies? Study locations? 2. Any suggestions for intellectual breadth? Honestly, I want to find an interesting class, but one perhaps not as intensive if possible. I hate to use the term \"GPA booster\", but I would not mind having a slightly easier class as insurance in case I struggle in Chem or Math. 3. What resources can I avail myself of in the college of engineering? I am looking for professors, other students that perhaps could help me, or even tutors. I am confident in myself, but I want to do everything possible to achieve success with my second (and last!) chance. 4. I hope this does not sound needy, but would anyone here be willing to help me as I transition back into Michigan? Seriously, even just someone to talk to. I know a few people still at Michigan, but I will not have a massive circle of friends. So, I would appreciate anyone that might be willing to help. Thank you to any and all that may offer advice. Cliche alert! I look forward to working extremely hard so I may become the outstanding Wolverine I know I can be. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I just received an email that the university saw my senior year grades and that I must submit an explanation of why they shouldn't revoke my admission, as well as my counselor/principal/adult who can vouch for me of some sort Senior year I became shift manager and worked 30 hours a week to be able to pay for the incredibly high OOS tuiton and took 6 AP classes. I've been so overwhelmed. I received a C in Calculus first semester and a C in Calculus and AP Chem second semester.  I can't stop crying and I just want an ease of mind. Does anyone know if my reasons are good enough to not be revoked? Since work is the main reason why my grades declined, would it be better to have my boss write the letter or should I ask my counselor? Or both? There's nothing more I want than to attend Michigan and I would be so so beyond devastated if my admission got revoked. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi! I got into the MRADS (previously MRC) program and now I'm a bit scared. Maybe it's just cause the contract is all written out, but has anyone heard or have experienced the program? Do I have time to do other activities? Is it difficult to balance with school work? Thank you! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm in the process of applying for an exchange semester at U of M as a mechanical engineer! I'm wondering if you guys have any reasons what makes your school stand out for a mechanical engineer like me. Are there any famous professors in these fields? So far I did find out that U of M ranks in the top 5 nationally for that major which is awesome but I'm wondering what other arguments i could put in my application. The campus is really big i read and it's easy to navigate around thanks to the public bus system. I'm also definitely putting down a fact about your awesome sports. Thanks so much for the help and maybe I'll see some of you next year! <eos> \n",

I can't find much info on what they look for on these applications beside meeting the 3.2 GPA requirement. I satisfy that requirement, although my GPA isn't great. Do they care much about GPA so long as it satisfies this requirement? Anyone with any experience or incite on any of the accelerated masters programs would be greatly appreciated.  <eos> \n",

I got section 21 row 37, but wasn't sure if they are any good. Wouldn't matter though if they're GA seating. <eos> \n",

I'm a big pirates fan and want to go to their game Wednesday night in Detroit. Is there a better way to get there besides taking a cab? I figured there has to be some kind of a campus system that won't just drop me off on some random street corner in a foreign city. Thanks.  <eos> \n",

I'd like to find a relatively affordable (under $50) frame which includes (ideally) a tassel holder and room for some pictures as well, but this diploma is so large that the usual places don't have a lot of options to accommodate my preferences. Any advice on where to look? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

Sorry for the low amount of info when I posted; I was stressed. I went to office hours and tutoring. Got As on the homeworks and quizzes. It's math 115, my first dealing with the math department here (stats 250 was nothing like this...). I thought I understood the concepts really well. In fact, I helped my friend attending a CC sometimes.  I did 7 past exams.  UPDATE: got a B-. Not great, but didn't fail.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I heard there was a joint MSW / Education degree. Which school is harder to get admitted to? I heard if you did IGR in undergrad (the classes, or commonground, or both?), you get preferential admissions to the MSW program. How hard is it once you're in the MSW program, is it much harder than undergrad, or no? I see the MSW doesn't require a GRE, but the Education school requires a GRE, so is the school or ed harder to get into, or not necessarily, or are these about equal and are not as hard to get into as Umich professional schools such as medical, or law, or MBA? How hard is this to get into vs the MBA, or the Master of Management if you're a Umich undergrad, or is the MSW and School of Ed not terribly had to get into for a masters, and do either of these programs require an interview, or no?  I see there's an MSW/Law joint option, but no Education/Law joint degree. Speaking of joint degrees, if you complete your first masters at Umich, and you go on to professional school such as an MBA or Law, can some credits from your masters transfer over, so you have less time/requirements for your professional degree, as would be the case if you're doing a joint degree, like the joint law programs, or no, the credits from your masters dont' count, since you did it seperately? Thanks.  For those in the masters of ed or msw, how is it, and is it much harder than undergrad, or not necessarily? Is it curved, and how hard is it to get a 3.5+ GPA? How much reading/writing is it?  <eos> \n",

These are the sandwiches/salads that come in little plastic boxes and sell for $5.39. I purchased one of these before and wondered why the bread was soggy. :/ I overheard two employees discussing this today. A food prep employee was asking if he/she needed to make more sandwiches for the display case. The response was – No, not unless we sell out. We'll toss the current stock (which was made Monday) Wednesday night. It's not a health concern, but it's getting there. I wouldn't eat a sub that'd been in the fridge that long, and these items shouldn't be sold. <eos> \n",

Needless to say, it has a lot of stuff in it, not much cash, but a lot of other things. Wondering what the best way to go about finding it is? We've checked the Michigan Union, Walgreens, Starbucks, and plan on going to the post office, library, and police station. Are there any other places we should be calling or going into look? Sorry if this is kind of thing gets posted a lot, but everyone here always seems super helpful and kind and it's the first place I thought to ask when she told me she couldn't find it. Cheers. Edit: FOUND IT! thanks for all the suggestions. However, nothing beats the luck of a good samaritan happening upon your wallet!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> We were residents of Michigan until about 2.5 years ago when my wife and I split and I took a job out of state. I left behind a son who is currently a senior at UofM and brought my younger 2 with me to North Carolina. Fast forward to now. Son #2 is now going through the college selection/application process. He applied EA to both UofM and UNC Chapel Hill, and was admitted to both, hence the quandary.  Some facts: * Kid bleeds Maize and Blue since elementary school. Michigan was always his dream. * He left MI after his freshman year at Grand Blanc High School, and is therefore not eligible for in-state tuition. * It takes him a long time to make friends. He had lived in Grand Blanc since pre-school. The first year after moving, he ate alone in the cafeteria of Ardrey Kell HS for the entire year. * None of his Michigan friends were accepted to UofM. * His Charlotte friends were accepted to either NC Chapel Hill, or NC State, which is close by. * Chapel Hill guarantees 100% of unmet need for in-state students, while Michigan does not do so for out of state enrollees. * USNWR rankings have the two institutions basically equivalent, but the QS World University Rankings have Michigan ahead by a mile. * No one asked me about my college or GPA after my first year in the labor market. * This will probably not be his terminal degree. He is interested in Medicine or Biostatistics going forward. Admission to a good graduate program is important. I guess that I am looking for some points of view to allow me to present the pros and cons to my son in a fair fashion. My personal preference is keep him closer to home and spend less money. My youngest son is currently a sophomore in high school, and I'll have to go through this decision again quite soon.  <eos> \n",

Do they look at your overall GPA or just the last two years like some other schools? I fucked up a bunch in the beginning but finally got my shit together in the last two years of undergrad so depending on how they look at the GPA it could be a factor for me. I also heard if you work a bit before applying your GPA doesn't matter a whole lot and recommendations/work experience count for more. <eos> \n",

I took online classes from a community college this semester, and am 95% sure I'll be returning to campus this fall, again in the RC. I'll be taking Intensive Spanish both semesters, which is 8 credits each. I just got an email today saying I've been accepted into the UROP program as a Sophomore. I was very excited, especially since I would like to take it as work-study rather than having to get another job for laundry money and such (I worked for Dining and did not enjoy it). I was wondering what your experience was with UROP. I want to do psychology research, I think, but am pretty open-minded. How was the work load? Did you find it valuable? Any tips/advice? If you took it for work-study, how was the pay? I know the paychecks probably won't be all that much, but did it seem worth it to take it for work-study rather than for credit? Any information you have on UROP would be appreciated! <eos> \n",

We've submitted our registration and we're hoping to finish our constitution by this weekend. In the meantime, we've made a Facebook page. If you're interesting in cubing (meaning, solving Rubik's and related cubes, or learning how to solve cubes, or simply meeting with awesome people and making friends), please consider joining the club once we get it off its feet. In the meantime, we'll be keeping people updated using the Facebook page: [url link] If you have any questions about the club, please feel free to ask!  Update (12/9): We finished our constitution last weekend and we have our first (informal) meeting tonight from 6-7 pm on the 10th floor of 411 Lofts on East Washington Street (near North Quad). We'll have food and drink and we'll be discussing how we want to organize the club. If you're interested, please show up! Here's a map of where it is: [411 lofts]([url link] <eos> \n",

I don't plan on using it daily, but I would probably need it 1 to 3 times a week.

I'm not sure if I was nervous or if it's because the test was based on precalc and it's been a year since that class or what. Either way, I was expecting to go into calc 1 and instead I was \"tentatively recommended\" for precalc.  The math advisor said I was right on the edge, and he didn't want to try to tell me what class to take. He did tell me about math 110, which I guess is like a condensed version of precalc I could do if end up doing calc 1? Idk. I'm leaning towards calc 1, especially if I do choose to do physics, and I'm hoping it'll be a little better considering I just took calc in high school. I know they won't be the same, but I'm hoping it'll help a little bit. Does my thinking make since? Any advice? <eos> \n",

Obviously there are no hills or mountains or anything within walking distance of UM but I am interested to hear where I can go take a nice walk in nature. For reference I have never visited the campus.  I do see that there is an arboretum on campus which I am really excited about. I'll be in Mosher-Jordan hall, because I'm going to be in WISE. I will not have a car and while I know UM shuttles exist I know nothing about where they go or anything. Thanks!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I put in my application, but I was not actually expecting to get accepted as a transfer with only 22 credits completed. Some background: I am 23, getting out of the Marine Corps in July from California, married with two dogs. Wife is a Registered Dental Assistant. We had been planning on moving farther east toward Macomb so that I could work and go to community college in order to transfer next year, so all of our house hunting and planning has been for that area. Some questions I have:  Best cost/quality areas around or just outside of Ann Arbor to live? I had planned to work more full time when I was looking at CC, but now that I will be going to UoM I would like to make that my primary focus. So money will be a bigger factor.  How is the traffic around Ann Arbor? Since we will be looking more outside of the city to save on costs I will be commuting in for school. My car is great on gas, so that isn't a worry. I would just like to get a rough idea on what the commute will be like. How is working while going to school? Are there decent jobs in the area for students? I will be getting the GI bill, which will pay for full tuition and $1600 a month for housing, as well as my wife will be working. I would like to continue working to just to supplement our income, at least for the first bit so that we can make sure we are solid. I'm used to doing school and working more than full time with the military, so I don't think that would be too big of an issue for me. I'm extremely excited to be accepted and can't wait to start! Thanks in advance, and GO BLUE! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone, I was thinking about my course schedule for next year's fall semester (I'll be a junior). This was the course schedule I was thinking about. Before you tell me I'm crazy for taking 3 EECS classes (especially with 281 and 370) and Linear Algebra, you should know that I've already taken Math 217, and I'm currently taking EECS 281.  Unfortunately, I received a C- in Math 217 and based on my performance in 281 so far, I'll likely not pass that either. That's why I'm taking 214 and 281 again. So given that, how feasible is this schedule? Edit: I just checked my Project 2 grade today (March 5th) and mid term grade and did a lot better than expected. I'll probably pass the class now. Thanks for the help though! <eos> \n",

I was wondering what suggestions you guys had for a 2-3 credit easy/less intense intellectual breadth class.  Is Ling 111 an interesting class that is fairly easy to do well in? Also for these classes, do professors require that I attend every class? If not, is this schedule fine for my first semester. Thanks  <eos> \n",

Myself and my friends started the club just for fun, but we've kinda wanted to start playing against other schools in competitions. I guess what I'm asking is, does Michigan have any sort of croquet club or be willing to start one up so we can set up a sort of pseudo-Big Ten croquet league? I just think it would be kind of badass to work something like that out. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Well, I'm an undergraduate senior and my parents are moving out of the country for about a year and I have to find a home for my cat and dog. I'm currently living in NQ, but since dorms have a zero-tolerance policy on cats and dogs, I was wondering if you guys were aware of quality off-campus housing that are pet friendly.  It's very important for me to bring the cat, but not so much the dog. Dog is very friendly and gets along with everyone, so in worst-case scenario she can go to my sister's. But as for the cat, she's very shy and reclusive, so it would be best for her to stay with me. It took her about a year to fully get used to me, so I don't think she'll be too happy being in a new surrounding without me.  My guess is that pets are usually not allowed in off-campus housings either since college students aren't well-known for keeping things tidy, but if you guys know any place that allows at least cats, please do share.  edit: I should mention that I'm not planning on having a car, so a place within a walkable distance to central would be best.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello all, I would really like some help from current and former college students, and I figured why not go to the Reddit community for my own college. I entered into college with the dream that many students have, an undergraduate career on a pre-health track, specifically pre-pharmacy. After half a semester, I don't believe this is what I want to do anymore, I'm just not passionate about the aspects of the profession of pharmacy, the pre-requisites for entry into Pharmacy School just don't engage me like my other classes do. I've always had a passion for history and politics, and am heavily considering a switch towards a degree focused towards that... Why does it feel like I'm failing my parents because I want to switch to something I'm more passionate about though? I'm an 18 year old, legal adult, and I'm literally fearful of telling my mother I don't want a STEM degree, that I'd rather pursue a career elsewhere. Any guidance or help you can offer would be fantastic, this is really troubling for me, and I'm not sure what the right path is anymore, so any help would be very appreciated! EDIT: The basis for my \"engagement\" statement are the liberal arts classes I'm taking now. I absolutely love my English and History classes that I have. I enjoy the writing in these classes, crafting arguments, and the in-class discussion that we have. It really bothers me that I don't feel the same way about my current Pre-Pharmacy classes, and this had really been a driver of the thoughts I've been having. <eos> \n",

I always see tons of apartment buildings around, but it's difficult to find the rent, floor plans, and information for those places.

Can you help me with which topics I should study and which topics will come first in the class? I can access the past syllabi through the course guide, but it only says the chapter names for which topics will be covered first and I don't have the textbook. Is there a PDF, or should I just buy the textbook? I didn't really want to buy it because I didn't use the textbook for Orgo 1 and I did fine. <eos> \n",

I have been playing since the last five years and I do not want to stop playing. It would be great if anyone would provide information about the squash facilities on the campus and if there any clubs or competitions for the sport. I have gone through all information provided by the university about this, but it was quite vague and confusing as there have been reports of squash courts being converted into gym equipment rooms. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently a freshmen engineering student. Next semester I'm taking Physics 140, Engr 101, Math 215 or 216 (I've heard they're non-sequential, not sure if people prefer taking one before the other). That puts my at 13 credits. Ideally I'd like to take another class to go towards the required intellectual breadth classes for engineers that wasn't overly time consuming or difficult. I was curious if anyone who has been in a similar suggestion had any class ideas? In addition, I've been looking at the course guide and found a few I was interested in, and I'd really appreciate if anyone who has taken one of them to give any input if they have any: Astro - 101,102,106,115,127 Clarch - 221,350 Earth - 103,108,109,153,262,277 Econ - 101 History - 201 Spanish - 231 Thanks! <eos> \n",

No matter what browser I use (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) the video is still very choppy. I know it isn't my network speed because my computer is hardwired to the wall which gives me very fast speeds.

It states, \"The College requires a fourth-semester proficiency in a foreign language for all [baccalaureate] programs.\"  So, in other words, I'm going to have to take a foreign language each semester during my two remaining college years (barring a miraculous score on a placement exam)?  With that, what are your thoughts and experiences regarding LSA's foreign language courses? Have any of you had enjoyable experiences abroad?  Much thanks and, of course, Go Blue!!

            "<bos> **tl;dr - Interested in front-end development, graphic design, and HCI but worried the BSI is weak on programming skills. Any current students/recent graduates care to weigh in?** Hey all. Question for those in the School of Information. I left the University ~7 years ago after being disappointed with the academic culture within the social sciences as well as piss-poor employment opportunities for History majors. 2008 and debts from a major reconstructive surgery didn't help, either.  I'm seriously considering re-enrolling post-Go Blue Guarantee and am really interested in software development. That being said, an applied maths degree and intensive algorithmic design aren't my interest nor my strong suit, so CS would be something of a gambit. I've spent my time away from UMich as a hobbyist programmer, media production and graphic designer, and consummate front-end monkeyer who's picked up some back-end knowledge along the way and the BSI looks very appealing, especially the UX Design and Information Analytics concentrations.  Back when I was attending, Informatics (which I guess isn't a thing anymore?) was still a relatively young major and all my friends in the program were required to take only one programming course: EECS 182, which I guess is now SI106 and taught entirely in Python instead of C++. In that respect, the BSI seems to have far more programming options geared towards data analytics and web development than Informatics did, which are my primary interests. However, scanning the employment outcomes for BSI grads, I found that while there are a number of people in UI/UX Design and a handful of Front-End Developers, the vast majority seem to become consultants of some sort for large institutions like Deloitte or IBM - cogs in the corporate machine and paper pushers, from what it seems. (No offense to anyone who wants that, it's just not for me.)  Moreover, when comparing U of M's curriculum with other iSchools (University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon, etc.) I'm left with the impression that similar programs across the country are far stronger in their \"technical\" curriculum with UMich aiming more for the research/theory/social sciences angle. Perhaps the BSI curriculum could be supplemented with EECS courses/a CS minor? Any current/recent BSI students care to weigh in? Sorry for the lengthy post and thanks for reading - going back to school would be a major commitment of time and energy so I thought I'd get some input before proceeding. <eos> \n",

For people who have declared data science, what do you like/not like about it, and is it a degree worth getting? It seems really interesting, but I'm very hesitant about it because it's not one of the \"classic\" engineering branches that people recommend (e.g. Chemical, computers, mechanical, etc.) While I've heard that data science is going to be high in demand in following years, I'd love to know people's opinions on it, specifically about the umich program as well.

            "<bos> Hello Wolverines, I'm considering transferring to Michigan next year from Northeastern University and I'm wondering if there are any transfer students out there that I could ask about the experience. Also, to the non-transfers out there: is anyone in the Economics or Sociology program? I would be concentrating in one of those two and I know Michigan is ranked very highly for both, but what is the quality of the actual professors in the classroom? Are they willing to engage with you personally? The main reason I decided not to go to Michigan in my freshman year was because I wanted a slightly smaller school.  I'm also wondering about the general attitude toward transfer students there- is it something like \"oh, you didn't get in freshman year, you must be stupid\"? If it helps, I will be entering as a sophmore, not a junior as many transfer students to.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello all.  I just wanted to take some time to point out a wholly embarrassing occurrence on the diag going on right now. We have a man and his mission team, promoting their Christian faith, while a much larger group of students crowd around with the express intent to bring down his image of himself and his church, and are doing everything in their power to mock and intimidate him. They are standing as close as they can to him, yelling in his ears, and getting in his way.  Though I no longer subscribe to a faith, I believe that this is appalling. We in this country are entitled to free expression of faith and right now a large group of our leaders and best are intently using infantile and aggressive methods to communicate with this man instead of perhaps speaking to him, or better yet abstaining from interacting with him at all. Most frustrating is the fact that when the Palestine/Israel conflict flares up here, we allow the Palestinians to have vast protests free of combat. Their grief stems from religion, yet we selectively allow them to go harassment free.  Is the opportunity to attack a small group of Christians instead of a big one the reason you all are doing this today? If so you are cowards. Is it because you believe Islam has more legitimacy than Christianity? If so you are bias and spiteful. Either way you cut it, these are not the actions of the kinds of people we want in this school.  If you saw, took part, or have questions, feel free to post. We are adults here, we all need to act like it.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm an Earth major, and was told by quite a few people at the alumni panel recently that knowing Python and some data science makes you a much more competitive job applicant for industry jobs. So, I'd like to do that! But... I have zero programming experience, and I'm not sure where the best place to start would be - SI 106, or EECS 183? How are the difficulty of each as a complete beginner, and how do the grade averages look? I need my GPA to stay pretty high for my concurrent undergrad/grad degree thing, so I really can't afford to walk away with anything below a B+. Also, any ideas on the data science front? What would be the best way to gain experience in something like that? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

My advisor said it was feasible and with some pre reqs finished through ap credits I feel I won't be any further behind. I'm still up in the air at this point and this is just my current plan.  I'm wondering if anyone has done something similar and could offer any advice?  Is it also possible to have a minor in LSA while in Ross?  Thank you in advance!  <eos> \n",

He did cognitive behavioral therapy and had free ocd support groups. I have UM Premier Health Insurance here and I need to choose one psychiatrist from a specific network of doctors. Can anyone recommend one regardless of the network limitation? I got the insurance yesterday so I'm a bit lost. Also I signed up for the NAMI - WC support group.

The Michigan Cycling team is a Club Sport who competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference. Other teams in our conference include MSU, OSU, Notre Dame, Indiana, Wisconsin, Purdue, Illinois, Case Western, Louisville, Northwestern, Cincinatti, Marquette, Miami (NTM), and a bevy of other small schools. Our conference also features a few schools that consider cycling a varsity sport including Marian and Lindenwood. The kit order is once again live and this year they're added a couple more options. These are the same exact uniforms that the team is currently racing in. More information about the team can be found here: [url link] Prices do tend to run a bit high, but such is the nature of being a small fish in the big pond of paying university royalties and the like. Any proceeds go towards helping get team member's to races and most importantly nationals. The order closes on April 11th, and the kits will be delivered to you in mid May.  Please note that because this is a custom order, there is no returns. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.  KIT ORDER LINK: [url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm registering for housing tomorrow morning and I'm basically set on either West Quad or North Quad. Both sounded solid to me for a variety of reasons, but (in my mind) one hasn't really made its case over the other; I'm mainly hoping for a solid social environment and decent rooms for someone who wants a single. Anyone have any insight? Obviously there's a lot to West Quad that's still up in the air (and it seems like rooms are filling fast - Cambridge House rooms are the old Union hotel, right?), but any thoughts would be appreciated. Many, many thanks in advance. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello! I was just wondering if engineering majors (after freshman year) tend to live more on North or Central Campus. I thought the answer was obviously North but some people I've talked to said either is honestly fine. Which area is more popular for people to get an apartment after freshman year? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I feel a little uneasy trying to find/decide on a place to live on such short notice (especially given that most leases are often for the full year, so I'll be there to stay for a bit despite what my thoughts may be).  I thought this would be a good place to start in regards to searching for another place, or at least ideas on where else I could search. *** Is there anyone that wants/needs a roommate?  Any good resources that you've seen/used to find affordable housing?  Advice? ^(Thanks for the help, I appreciate it~) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Who thought this was a good idea? The old long tables provided a ton of workspace and a ton of seats. The \"renovation\" just involved them taking those tables out and replacing them with the awkwardly shaped pentagonal tables from the 1st floor. Except the new furniture seats about a third of the amount of people the old furniture did. The basement used to be a pretty good low-noise study spot, but now it just looks empty with a couple clumps of tables pushed together. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> If anyone is interested in joining a new student org focused on 3d printing, CAD deign, and building rep-rap style printers then please shoot me a message! I have received support from 3D-Hubs, so even if you have no design experience you can still get things printed. Currently looking for anyone with a passion or interest regarding this fast-growing technology. Personally, I own 1 printer that I built. From the sponsorship with 3D-hubs, they will be able to provide 15% off for the entire club. So if you need parts printed for a prototype, to build your own printer (yes they can print themselves!), or just to try it out we will be starting off strong.  If you have any questions or interest please message me.  Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi, I am a current sophomore who will be studying abroad in the fall. I'd rather not get stuck with freshman seats for my senior year of football by getting no points, so I'd like to buy season tickets for this year and then sell them to someone (presumably just for the same price but if you want a little discount I'm fine with that). I have 21 priority points for this year, so if you have fewer than that and don't care about next year (say, because you'll be a graduating senior), this might be a good deal for the both of us. PM me if you're interested. <eos> \n",

I'm not someone that picked whatever major because they knew they were going to graduate school or picked what seemed like it could be the most interesting.  With that being said, I was told that Ross' Econ majors have access to significantly better employment resources than LSA econ majors. Would you say this to be fact? I also read several threads on CollegeConfidential that said the Econ program as a whole at Umich was much weaker than one would think. This has me really worried now. Are there any Econ or LSA majors that can concur/refute?  Lastly, what does everyone think of the LSA Opportunity Hub? <eos> \n",

I'm from Texas and everyone here is telling me not to go to U of M because of the terrible winters. So I was wondering, how bad can it be? If I buy a good winter jacket and gloves, will I be able to survive? I've also heard that it's not as much the cold/snow that's bad but the lack of sunshine. I'd appreciate some input on the matter from actual students. Thanks a lot! <eos> \n",

I know that ECON 101 is a prerequisite for the application, but I've already set up my classes for this semester. I know most kids take it in fall but I don't want to have to drop a class and return books I've already ordered. Does it matter if I take it in the winter semester vs the fall? If I take the class in winter I should still be fine for the application, right? <eos> \n",

Have they posed a real issue to the people who are taking the pre-med route? I have no doubt in my mind that the academics are stellar, and I just want to make sure I'll be able to reliably pursue my passion. Thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I know research has been done that shows the physics of the stadium doesn’t reflect and keep noise in effectively, but the crowd at our games aren’t very rowdy either. The Big House is notorious for being quiet and non-intimidating. I think the student section does somewhat of a good job of staying engaged but it seems the rest of the crowd could care less. I went to undergrad at another school and have brought friends from other schools like Washington, Penn State, FSU and then OSU and they all thought their crowds were orders of magnitude louder and more engaged. Even their student sections are much louder. Imagine if we could get loud enough to actually force offensive penalties on other teams and disrupt their offense, that would actually give meaning to home-field advantage. Maybe this could give us that push to the next level we have been waiting on for the team. Thoughts? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, All. So, I'm living over in the Oxford houses on the far east side of campus and my job is near the Michigan Union. Parking over there, as you all likely know, is miserable. Walking across campus in 70 degree weather is equally miserable. So, I was considering perhaps finding a place to shower and change near my job. Does anybody have any suggestions? are there any locations on campus that have locker rooms other than the CCRB? Specifically, near the union? Thanks in advance, All--I very much appreciate it. <eos> \n",

Also, what do y'all wear to tailgates? I'm a guy, btw. I think I have an idea based off seeing tailgate/gameday posts on IG. Are oversized football jerseys the go-to? Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi UM! A friend of a friend at UM said that a lot of students here don't like chinese international students very much. Just wondering - is this true, and if so, what may be the reason(s) for this? Or is the dislike of chinese international students just prevalent in most US universities? And are attitudes towards Chinese Americans different to that of Chinese internationals students? I'm not trying to offend anyone, just genuinely curious, as a Hong Kong student who is very interested in UM. edit: english is my first language, and i attend an english-speaking high school where many of my friends aren't chinese. i was initially worried about my place in US colleges as a chinese international but after reading this thread i guess there isn't too much to worry about. thank you all for your responses!!  <eos> \n",

FA for me will be a pretty big part of whether or not I'll attending UMich, so if I hear back too late will I end up with bad choices for housing (I'd like to not end up on north campus as I've heard it's the least social)? 3. I'm not expecting a full-ride, but how much could aid could I expect as an OOS applicant? I did do the FA calculator, but I'd like to hear first-hand accounts. Thanks, and Go Blue!! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi, I'm a freshman going into my second semester here. This semester I'm taking 13 credits: Spanish, Chemistry 130, Bio 173 (Bio lab), and a first year writing seminar. I also worked on average 11 hours a week in the dining hall and I think I managed well, though it was a bit rough around midterm time. Next semester, I'm taking 18 credits: psych 111, chem 125/126 (chem lab), Arabic 102, stats 250, and English 298 (intro to literary studies). Because freshmen register last, my schedule basically goes from 8-4 everyday (with some breaks in between). I've never been good at math and I'm scared for the chem lab because I've heard it can be really tough. My question is: should I quit my job? I don't need the money or anything, but my concern is that employers will look down on me for quitting. Also, I feel bad saying this when others are taking 20+ credits and working full time but never complain. <eos> \n",

They mention $8 a day at one point, but then say students parking during daytime hours pay $1.20 an hour. If I'm parking on Day 1 and not leaving until Day 3, what's my rate?

The award is presented annually the top player in NCAA Division I men's hockey. Hunwick has appeared in a career-high 37 games this season, posting a 23-10-3 record with five shutouts, a 1.97 goals-against average and a .934 save percentage and setting new single-season career highs in wins and shutouts. He is tied for second nationally in wins, shares third in shutouts, ranks fourth in save percentage and games played and is seventh in goals-against average. Since a 1-0 win on Dec. 3 at Alaska, Hunwick has posted a 16-3-1 record with four shutouts, a 1.48 goals-against average and a .950 save percentage. During that span, he helped Michigan to the 2011 Great Lakes Invitational championship, stopped a career-high 46 shots in a 4-0 win at Ohio State on Jan. 13, and led the Wolverines to a two-game sweep of Notre Dame in the CCHA Quarterfinals, allowing just two goals in two games. A former third-string walk-on, Hunwick has appeared in 84 career games for the Maize and Blue, earning a 53-22-7 record with 10 shutouts, a 2.05 goals-against average and a .928 save percentage. He is Michigan's all-time leader in goals-against average and save percentage, ranks fourth in shutouts, is seventh in wins and ranks ninth in games played. The top 10 finalists will now be voted on by a 23-member selection committee and through a second round of fan balloting to determine the Hobey Hat Trick of three finalists, which will be announced on Thursday, March 29. The 2012 Hobey Baker Memorial Award will be presented on Friday, April 6 at 6 p.m. in Tampa, Fla.\" EDIT: Voting link [url link]  <eos> \n",

I've been to games in the past as a non-student, and obviously those tickets were reserved seating.  When I picked up my tickets the other day, a lady from the ticket office told me I had an assigned seat. I often hear other law students requesting tickets for friends coming into town, and I will be wanting to do the same eventually. Is my \"assigned seat\" actually assigned or is this just a formality? <eos> \n",

I will be an international student, in case that influences anything. 1. What type of city is Ann Arbor? What are the choices for entertainment or recreation? I particularly like hiking and being around nature. What are the viable opportunities? 2. Does the EECS department host an open-house for graduate fellowship students? 3. What is the cost of living/housing? How hard is it to find housing? I have a fellowship offer, but I'm not sure how much that pays yet. Can anyone enlighten me? 4. Some dept-specific questions:  a) What is the state of research funding available to the EECS dept?  b) How many students does the dept. fund per professor?  c) How common is it for professors to fund conference visits?  d) What are the internship and future job opportunities like compared to other research universities (eg. Washington/UIUC/Stanford)?  Any other random info or comments are welcome too <eos> \n",

I am working on a few applications and am looking for a really good front-end dev to help with UI/UX and graphics.  I am interested in finding a front-end developer to work with to create html  css templates for 3 different web and mobile apps.  I only need the front-end html  css pages developed and I will connect up all the backend services. I have laid out all the features I need into a rough design but I need a really good designer (who can also write front end code) to help me make these apps look and work really really well.  The apps categories are: 1) Cloud Note taking / Bookmarking Application With Collaboration features and public sharing options. demo: [url link] Basically need help with UI/UX and graphics here.  2) Photobook app to create realtime cloud photobooks.  3) Flashcard Quiz App  This is a chance to work on a fun creative product that is also very useful. These app will have powerful modern features including single page (no page reloads), and realtime (all data pushed to each client). I am using the Meteor.js framework to create the app.  If you are interested please PM me with your information and links to some previous work you've done. Then we can chat in more detail about each project and you can quote me a price for each project. I prefer fixed price contract for these. The front-end code needs to be completely responsive and work on desktop and mobile.  Look forward to hearing from some really good local designers.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I didn't really have any other plans set for this summer, so I figured I could take a class or two at my local college to get them out of the way. However, I'm just not sure which to take, so I would appreciate some advice!  After this semester I'll be done with chem 130, and physics 140 and 240. I usually hear 240 is the one to take over the summer if you can but I'll be done with it by then, oops. As for math I'm currently taking 215, so 214 was what I was considering taking over the summer. Besides those I'll also be done with Engineering 100 and 101 by the time summer rolls around.  tl;dr: what cs-eng reqs would be good to get out of the way elsewhere?  thanks! <eos> \n",

I’ve ALWAYS wanted to learn how to play and I was wondering if there’s any place where students can learn how to play (ideally for free, but if there are payed lessons that are cheap I’d still be interested) Thanks! <eos> \n",

Not quite Ann Arbor (I got a 26) but still comfortably above average, and I was wondering, if I went to Flint for the first two years or so, and maintained a 3.5+ GPA, would it be feasible to transfer to ann arbor? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So my parents are divorced and I live with my mother. The financial aid office requested that I submit a tax transcript and a \"non-custodial parent profile\". After a lot of pain and suffering, we finally got the second CSS profile submitted, and I am now waiting on my financial aid package. I am not expecting my father to contribute anything to my tuition, and the financial aid package was supposed to be calculated from my mother's financial information. Does anyone know if the added information about my father could negatively affect my eligibility? <eos> \n",

I have been frantically checking my phone for an email for the past days and I still haven't gotten my decision. My father was a wolverine and all I wan't is to be able to say the same and I am getting worried that something may be wrong with my App at admissions, is there anything I can do even though the offices for admissions is closed? Thanks and Happy Holidays! <eos> \n",

Is there some resource for students? Usually I just pick up another bottle at the Costco pharmacy when I go home, but I'll be on campus for a while longer and I have no idea where/how I can get my meds. I have insurance too, so at Costco I get a bottle of this medication for like 3 dollars.  If anybody knows where I can get my meds, and if there is a cheap resource for students, let me know.

Ideally, they would be fairly large (3'x2' or greater), painted on a canvas (i.e: not just a flat piece of paper), and less than $100.

I know I want to declare my major in SAC once the time comes, but I'm wondering how I should best take advantage of my summer term. Should I try to knock off my prerequisites for SAC?

I know they check if a student has an M card at games, but do they check what kind of M Card it is? Like via scanning it or something.  I have an M card, but it says Temp instead of Student the bottom. I’m just not tryna drop $40 to validate a student ticket. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone ! I'm a Frenchman who is working as an intern at the University of Toledo until the end of July (I arrived last week in the States). I want to visit the nice areas close to Toledo, and Ann Arbor may be one of them. I really want to watch a Football Game in the US but I've heard that the season only started next August :/ However, I saw that there was something called Spring Game on the 14th and I think it might be one of my only opportunities to go to a stadium watch some football. So, my question is, is it worth it to spend a week end in Ann Arbor ? What is there to do/see besides the game ? I basically don't know anyone except for my lab's colleague in Toledo, how could I blend in and meet people to have fun there and not be alone ? I guess I'll be coming by Greyhound and stay in an Airbnb on Friday and Saturday. If you have any advice for me or thoughts about this plan, feel free to tell me ! Thanks a lot :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm a freshman in engineering right now, and I'm taking eng 101, physics 240, calc 4, and musicology 346, but I'm kinda worried about the course load. Should I maybe drop calc 4 and take it over the summer or next year, or will I regret that in the future? I'm kind of ahead of schedule so I thought it'd be a good idea to space my classes out a little. Sorry if this is a stupid question. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Going to risk sounding dumb, but I emailed the school two days ago and haven't gotten a reply. Bills were posted today, due 8/31. When I do the math to see what is being charged (excluding a purchase from Computer Showcase), I see it's more than what was posted on the official aid award letter/document I can look at through Wolverine Access. I'm pretty confused as to how using loans given through financial aid work when paying a bill. For anyone that has experience paying their bill, how does it work? Is this bill the total cost not accounting x amount of dollars that I got in financial aid (which are then applied when paying, or?  Sorry if it sounds dumb, but like I said, I emailed the school two days ago and didn't get a reply so I'm somewhat worried and confused. Thanks <eos> \n",

Can someone give me a little insight into how big the closets generally are and how much storage space is available in the room. I don't know what hall I'll be rooming in, but I'll be in a double.

            "<bos> I am currently signed up for a humanities class that I have no interest in taking but have to fill requirements for. I am on the waitlist for classes that I would much rather take and am much more interested in (CLCIV 392) but I don't know how many people will drop. I think there are around 10 people on the waitlist and I just joined it recently. To take 392, I have to reschedule a lab where attendance is required. The only good time I can take the lab and have the rest of my schedule work semi-nicely would be overlapping with the humanities class that I did make it in and am not that interested in taking. I'm wondering if I should go ahead and reschedule it if a lot of people will drop.  I've never dealt with the waitlist for humanities classes so I don't know if I should worry about it too much or not... Any advice appreciated :) Edit: Also one more question. How do the waitlists work in general regarding discussions? Say there were 6 people in the waitlist for discussion A and 4 people in discussion B. Should I join Waitlist B for maximum chance of getting in the class, or is it on a completely first come first serve basis? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> LSA 2015 here. I live in the LP and am (likely) majoring in either Econ or Psych and working towards a minor in Political Science or Complex Systems. I'm hoping to end up in consulting-style work or in research after graduation, but I'm behind when it comes to technical skills. As far as I can tell EECS 183 and ACCOUNTING 271 and 272 are going to come in handy, but if I can get them out of the way cheaply I'll be a happy man. Has anybody taken equivalent classes from a school other than UMich and tried getting the credits transferred? Would you recommend the effort? And if the credits don't transfer, will it be an issue? I'm guessing it's less of a problem if you're taking the classes for the skills, but I'd like to hear your opinions. <eos> \n",

Looking &lt; 2 other roommates besides myself, male roommates preferred but honestly whoever is available will be fine. Cheap, and as close to campus as I can get. Down to drink/party is a plus. Also, has anyone ever lived in Chabad house before? I'm not Jewish, but it looks cheap as hell and is literally on top of campus.

This semester all the stuff I've done has been on or related to my studies (MySQL, a little team-hack style programming) and exercise. With my studies in good shape, I'd like to get to know more people and be more social than I have been so far. For next semester I've already signed up for parliamentary debate (or MUN), wolverine cuizine and Michigan Muscle club. Do any of you have any suggestions for clubs to join or things to get involved in to meet more people and make more friends? I'm not much of a party person, but would definitely be willing to try that kind of stuff out as well if there are some good/easy to join ways to do it. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I was at the door of one place next to south quad when the guy guarding the door got to me and asked who and what year I was. I told the truth because I have no reason to lie, and they initially tried to send me away. One of the guys there asked me if I knew about certain areas/streets (where parties are most commonly found) and eventually just asked what made me walk up. I sort of told him that I saw an open door and thought 'fuck it,' and I guess he liked that because he let me in -- much to the dismay of the people with him. I didn't end up staying because I really didn't feel like partying, but I was wondering what that was all about. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I recently got invited to both of these honors societies and I'm trying to figure out which one to join. I found a few threads about this topic on google, but they were all old and the chapters seem to vary greatly between different campuses (as expected). I heard that TBP is more selective (top 1/8 of CoE students) than HKN (top 1/4 of EECS students), but since HKN is more specific to my major, they are equally appealing to me. Depending on the mass meetings and responses here, I may decide to join both. The only issue is that I'm taking some relatively rough classes this semester and don't have very much time..but we'll see what happens. Does anyone have any experience with these honors societies? <eos> \n",

Does this mean that most off-campus houses do not have internet all together? Or that most houses have internet but just don't include it in the rent?  I would really appreciate it if anyone with off-campus housing experience could give me some input on whether or not most houses come with internet, and on how to find out if a house has internet prior to taking a tour.

            "<bos> Here's the story. Michigan resident (East Coast transplant) who wants to get a graduate degree in something outside of business for a variety of personal reasons. Unlike NYU/Columbia, etc., where plenty of people will go to night/weekend courses to do this (think Wall Street guy who wants to learn about art history), Ann Arbor graduate programs appear to be only towards those who want to do research, teach, or become a PHD. So I looked on the Rackham website and they do offer a Master of Liberal Studies at UM Flint, which I could probably commute to without a huge problem. The issue is, the degree is from Rackham but the diploma would say UM-Flint. Now, I am mid-career so not looking to make some gigantic life change, but would like a degree of the caliber of NYU/Columbia/UCLA-level, which Ann Arbor certainly is. I said to Rackham, \"when you get an MBA from Ann Arbor, it is from Ross, but an MBA from UM Flint is not. Is \"Rackham, Rackham\", no matter where it comes from\". And they were not able to give be a conclusive answer.  Again, I am not looking to get on a road where I am going to get a masters degree/PHD so I can teach philosophy to the world, it's more a learning for the desire to learn that is driving me. So if anyone has any insight, would a Rackham degree from UM Flint be a UM degree with an \"asterisk\"? Or, maybe there are some UM Ann Arbor graduate programs that can be done on weekend/nights. I do know the School of Education has a digital media program that includes communications, etc. that can be done part time, but not sure of all the requirements.  Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide. Sincerely, Had One Two Many Business Courses During My Life <eos> \n",

I have EECS 203 and 280 with a 300 level humanities in the schedule.  I understand that no one would've taken both of them, so essentially *any* experience and advice is welcome.

Is there supposed to be a difference between the 2 rooms? We're both in MoJo for MRADS if that makes any difference. My economy double is cheaper than my roommate's double by about a $1,000. Would my roommate or I be able to change our room type so we can match each other's at this point with the contracts already out?

I know I could just find some random course that fits with my schedule but I was wondering if there was one that you enjoyed. I'm trying to be an IA next semester so work load is a consideration but not the only one. This is not a 'how can I work as little as possible' post edit: I actually need SS, RE, ULW, and HU. Anything you liked that covers at least two would be super helpful <eos> \n",

Also I am interested in the u of m's history department, so if anyone had opinions about the programs offered that would be great. Any insight about the school would be great as I have not been able to see the college. Thank you in advance, all help is appreciated. GO BLUE! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I got deferred to LSA in December with 3.94 GPA and 30 ACT. I only had one rec letter. I was in a couple of clubs and I've had the same job for two and a half years. I've also taken community college classes at night for the last two year(16 credits). I'm really confused at why I got deferred because I know people who get in that were less qualified then me. Edit: AP's: US History (5) Micro-econ (4) Macro-econ(5) Physics B (taking now) Psychology (taking now) Calculus AB (taking now) Government (taking now). Edit: By less qualified I mean people who had no extra curriculars, a 28 and a 3.8 gpa.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm scheduled for 15 credits: EECS 381 (4) EECS 492 (4) PSYCH 242 (4): Language and Human Mind PHIL 482 (3): Philosophy of Mind Does anyone have experience with 381 or 492 that can evaluate this situation and give me an honest assessment of whether it is a really bad idea? Ideally, I'd be taking 381, 242, and 482 for sure, but this only leaves me with 11 credits, which doesn't count as full time. I scheduled 492 because I do need to fulfill requirements (I'm actually going to take an additional semester to graduate). I'd be open to suggestions for easy flex tech or EECS classes too, so please share any info you think that can help. Other ULCS classes I'm interested in (in case someone wants to talk me out of 381): 487 (graphics), 482 (OS), 445 (machine learning), 485 (web info systems). One last request: I'd love to hear from someone who's taken 482. What's it like, workload, difficulty, stress level, etc. Thank you all! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone. I am a rising sophomore, and a couple days out from going back to Michigan for my sophomore year, I must say, while I am excited to go back, I am also really nervous. I can't really put my finger on why I am nervous, because I had a great Freshman year. But, for some reason, I am super nervous. Perhaps it is because I got so used to being at home again because Michigan's summers are so long, and thus subconsciously feel like I am going to school for the first time? I'm not sure. Anyways, is it unusual to be really nervous for Sophomore year? <eos> \n",

I'm a new transfer student from one of the other campuses and I am taking 401 this fall. I've heard the math is not to difficult but there are a lot of topics covered each week. I'm worried because since I'm transferring if tutoring will help ensure a smooth transition grade wise. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi guys, I was just admitted to UMich LSA and I was wondering if anyone here was an Economics major so I could possibly get some more information. Coming from a tiny high school out of state, I'm pretty concerned with class size and feel like I'd be completely overwhelmed. Not to mention, at a lot of schools, it's hard to get into all the necessary courses for an Economics major, so people have to stay for a 5th year. Is this an issue at Michigan? Really any information would be helpful. Looking forward to seeing you guys on campus! Go Blue! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> My friend and I are looking for a 2 or 3 person apartment (or house) to live in off campus next year. The two most important parts for us are proximity to central campus and price (we'd both like to spend in the $400-600 range each). Good management is also a must. Any recommendations? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm very interested in biomedical engineering but I know that's not the best undergrad degree. I'm interested in developing medical devices that people have to use with on a daily basis(not necessarily hospital equipment). I've heard MechE is good for this but otherwise I've never been to interested in that. I like chemistry and could see myself doing ChemE possibly but also MatSci interests me, and I don't know what would be the best of the two. I'm indifferent towards EE but I feel like that would be super helpful so I'm considering doing that or just an EE minor. Any tips? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So I'm a freshman in the college of Engineering and have been a part of MRacing throughout this first semester. Honestly while the project is really cool, I've been finding it really difficult to get involved simply because my major is CE and none of the electronics work starts on the car really until next semester and every time I go into the Wilson centre to work, it seems like there isn't a significant amount for me to do because most people already have projects going on. Also, the team keeps saying that I should be spending close to 5 hours a day in the shop if I really want to benefit from being part of the team which is just time I really can't commit. Anyway, I was wondering what Design-Build-Test teams have a decent number of projects an EECS major could get involved in, which also have a bit more of a structured design and build process (i.e. fixed build times to work on the parts) and would be useful for my resumé and for finding internships later? My passion is still with cars and vehicles, and I would really look forward to working with autonomous vehicles in the future. I'd be willing to commit about 5 to 7 hours a week to the team. Tl;dr EECS major looking for a switch from MRacing to a team with more structured hours (looking to participate maybe 5-7 hours a week) that is enjoyable but is career beneficial as well. <eos> \n",

However, it's a little hard for me to tell how I'm doing in the class since its curved only at the end of the semester and they aren't releasing averages for any of the assignments or anything that we're doing. Would anyone know what constitutes a good grade for assignments/exams/labs in this class? <eos> \n",

Or requires plenty of work for the extracurricular(planning events, etc..etc..) I'm just looking for people to hang with.  Greek life is out of the equation. I'm considered a sophomore/junior in terms of credits. Plus, it's not really my thing. Btw, I live off-campus with one flatmate I met recently, who is a decent guy but seems quite introverted.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm debating if I should take EECS 381 this upcoming fall, as it's really hard to get a sense of just how heavy the workload is. How does it compare to 482? In a past semester I took 482 with a 16-credit semester (including eecs 388, stats 250, and history 101). This semester i was pretty busy, mostly with 482, but it wasn't horrible. Is 381 significantly more time consuming than 482 or is it comparable? I could take it next fall with a 12-credit semester and make my other 8 credits really easy humanities courses, but from what I hear i'd still be swamped and have a miserable semester. So realistically, how bad is this course? Would taking it with a 12-credit semester during tailgate season and during recruiting season with interviews and all be a bad idea, or would it be fine if the rest of my schedule is super light? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> tldr: the liquor store next to Ashley's rings you up for one price then charges your card more without giving you a receipt.  A couple days ago, I went into this store to buy two 40s (I normally get alcohol from Meijer, but this was going to be a small purchase and I didn't want to drive). None of the 40s had prices, so I just picked two that I knew to be cheap (Olde English), and brought them to the counter. He rang them up at $4.50 each, which is a huge mark-up over normal price but whatever I was in a hurry. I gave the cashier my card, he quickly scanned it and gave it back, then waited for my receipt. After about 10 seconds of talking to his friend who was there with him, he looks back at me clearly annoyed that I'm still there and says \"you can go now.\" Figuring that it's a small purchase anyway, I don't bother to demand a receipt. However, when I checked my charge history the next day, I found out that he had actually charged me $11.00, $2 more than what he'd shown me when he rang me up. Now, I'm out two bucks and have no receipt to show that I was actually supposed to be charged $9, so I can't contest it. The combination of the facts that they don't have the price anywhere until they ring you up, don't give you a receipt, and overcharged me leads believe to believe this was not accidental. I suspect they're deliberately upcharging certain customers believing the customer won't bother to contest a $1.00 or $2.00 mischarge. I just wanted to put this here as a warning to anybody who may consider shopping there. If you do go there, avoid paying with a card so they can't pull this same scam on you. Given how bad their prices are, I don't see why anybody would go there in the first place (except maybe if you're under 21; they didn't card me even though I look really young), but just be careful.  <eos> \n",

Currently I am in a drawn out legal case involving two alcohol related misdemeanors. One being an MIP. Which is also my second to be painfully honest. I am not sure what my sentencing is going to look like, but hypothetically if I were not to serve jail time, would the admissions office still find out? Or would they only find out if I reported it to them. If any of y'all know anybody witha similar situation or advise please comment below. <eos> \n",

My preference is a nice room, with nice bathrooms and kinda close to the parties and classes. Doesn't have to be next door but 10-15min is about the max I'd be happy with.

I tried to drop the class from Wolverine Access but it keeps coming up as an error. Digging a little further I see that I have to fill out a form and have both the teacher and my instructor sign it to drop. However I'm not an LSA student, (Education). Everyone I've talked to said dropping was easy, but I'm not seeing it. Any help would be great.  FYI- I realize it getting late in the semester, but my GSI never mentioned any trouble with dropping at this point. <eos> \n",

Everyone has a constitutional right to their point of view and the ability to freely speak it, it seems as though today that if you have an opinion that does not align with the current viewpoints of the most spoken group that your opinion is suppressed rather than having an open discussion of the issues.

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm a sophomore studying electrical engineering and I've really been struggling with a lack of friends the past three semesters. The loneliness has really been taking a toll on my emotional health, and hard EE classes certainly don't help as well. I had a decent group of acquaintances freshman year in the dorms, but since I've moved to an apartment, our group has sort of fallen apart and I only see them once a while. Also I joined a student design team, but people seemed to never want to pursue a friendship outside the club, only wanting to do their club work. I'm too old to rush a social fraternity and my financial situation isn't all that great so I would have a problem paying dues. What sorts of clubs allow you to meet a good group of people that would hopefully turn into a friend group? I don't want to spend my junior and senior year Friday and Saturday nights alone in my apartment like I currently am doing. I'm not really athletic or musically talented, but I enjoy history and the humanities. I don't really want to join a student design team as well, but I want a club where people are really open and accepting and want to hang out outside of the club. I really appreciate any responses. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm an incoming freshman math/comp sci double major for next Fall. I am very passionate about mathematics, and I hope to someday be a research mathematician. The 295-396 intro sequence in particular was a big reason why I wanted to come to Michigan. I have a few questions for those who have taken it, though. 1. For the first year, at least, they call it \"Honors Math I/II\" rather than naming the classes after a specific topic. Also, I've read/heard varying things about what the specific content of the classes contains - some say it's strictly theoretical calc first semester, linear algebra second semester, etc. Others say that they mix in different topics and give more of a broad introduction to mathematics. Which of these would you say is more accurate? 2. Assuming one works hard both in and outside of class, how soon can undergraduates get involved in research? I guess this applies to the math major in general, but I'm specifically wondering wondering how well this sequence would prepare me to do something such as an REU. Is it realistic to try and get one after freshman year? 3. Besides research, is it common for professors to supervise independent study courses with undergraduates over the summer?  4. How many people are generally in the class? Not that I mind large class sizes, necessarily - I'm just curious.  Also, I would appreciate any general advice/thoughts from current or former math majors at Michigan on how to get the most out of their time at the university. Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

I'll be a senior this fall and obviously applying to schools across the country. I think I have what it takes to be a part of the University - I have a good GPA and scored well on standardized tests. Originally from Michigan (I lived in Farmington Hills until I was 10), I'm a huge Wolverines fan. The business school and Law programs are top-notch on paper - but I want to hear it from you. Convince me; convince me to want to go to this prestigious school. I could go to CU-Boulder in my backyard - just a 40 minute drive away - but the lure of being a part of the Maize and Blue is too great for me not to explore it. Let's hear it, convince me as to why Michigan is the best school in the country.  <eos> \n",

Out of 9 classes, I'll probably end up with 2 B+'s and one B. The main issue I have with this is that it's worse than my last semester, where I had 2 B+'s for 8 classes. All of my classes are IB classes, so they're very difficult, but I know it my grades and GPA still aren't really good enough. I'm in-state, and my ACT is 34, but I know that Michigan values GPA above all else. How badly did I hurt my chances? <eos> \n",

I emailed Engineering Career Center, but all they did was reference ECRC Annual Report for all majors but that didn't tell me anything about the Ann Arbor salaries.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I got placed in a fairly anti-social hall for this year, and I'm not a fan. The reason being I think is because I marked a form somewhere along the application process saying my intended major is Computer Science. While this is true, I have an inkling that it put me with my RA (also majoring in CS) along with everybody else in my hall. Don't get me wrong - they're good people, I like them, I've made friends with a few, but the vibe just isn't for me. So before I apply for housing for next year, is there any way I can remove this interest from the info they have on me? Is it in Wolverine Access somewhere, or is it something I select when I apply for housing itself? Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Junior here as a transfer. I have a job in one of the dining halls. I could just be freaking out because it's the first week and a lot of new stuff is being thrown at me but I started classes Tuesday and have classes Mon-Fri (16 credits) and work 12 hours a week.  I'm really overwhelmed and have had a lot of bad anxiety as a result of not 100% grasping the material in my classes yet and not really having the time to study because so far all of my days have been spent all day at work or school with periodic 1-2 hour breaks that are either spent working out or eating.  With that being said I don't want to make this just about me; hence, I put a title that is non specific to my situation. I can't be the only one that feels extremely overwhelmed at the moment so I was hoping some wonderful Umich students could share their wisdom. Thanks in advance!! <eos> \n",

I did some light programming in python last year. I also have a moderate course load next semester. Would EECS 183 or 280 be a better choice? Thanks <eos> \n",

If you or someone you know is looking for a subletter, please post here! Also, if anyone knows of a Facebook group and/or other website with UMich sublets, that would be helpful as well.

            "<bos> I'm starting grad school at UMich this fall. When I visited last month, a handful of current students indicated that I should begin looking for housing right about now. I'm looking for an apartment, preferably near central campus (being within walking distance of the North Quad would be awesome), with a move-in date sometime in August. Unfortunately, none of the online listings I've found are for that far in the future, and I really don't want to be paying rent for months before I'm able to move. So, I'm hoping some of you might be able to give me a few pointers about how to best secure housing for the fall. In particular, I have a few questions: 1. Is it really the case that I should be looking this early? 2. Are online listing sites my best bet, or would I be better off using a realtor or trying to find something through word of mouth? 3. I need to find something that I'll able to afford on a modest stipend from the University. Given my desire to be relatively close to campus, what are some relatively affordable neighborhoods I should consider? <eos> \n",

I know that it will be newly renovated for next year, so there are a lot of aspects about it that everyone is probably unfamiliar with, but does anyone have any pointers about living there? Which houses are the best? Is there a big difference between Cambridge House and the rest of WQuad? What's the social aspect usually like? <eos> \n",

In 1988, World News and Report had begun using some stats, but it was still mostly perception-based. It was then slowly transformed into the statistical nightmare it is today. [url link] <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey,  I am currently a senior in high school seeking answers regarding Michigan's admissions, and more specifically their GPA calculation. I've heard a lot of things about how UMich calculates their GPA. For one, I know that they recalculate their GPA where every A+, A, and A- = 4. I also heard from some that they disregard Freshman year for all applicants, but for this I could not find a 100% confirmation. Does anybody know for sure or have an updated answer? I am asking because Michigan is my extremely high reach school and I am trying to assess my chances. If they consider Freshman year, my cumulative is 3.1. If they disregard my Freshman year, my GPA is 3.79 (lol yeah my Freshman year was literally THAT bad). My extracurriculars are great, I wrote very good essays, and my test scores are decent so GPA is my only concern. Anybody have an answer? Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm gonna be a sophomore in the fall and was wondering which would be better for me: (I'm a CoE student but roughly half my classes will be on central) A 2 room 1 bath apt. at Sterling 411 Lofts or a 4 room 4 bath at the courtyards? I mostly like privacy and would prefer a single but none were available, so I'm not sure which of these choices is more private... Also both of these options have me rooming with either 1 or 3 other complete strangers... It's a toss up because courtyards seem more calm and out of the way but I have to take the 11 min bus every time I wanna go to central and I'll have to be with 3 others, but I'll get my own room/bath. And 411 lofts has a great location but I'll have to share almost everything w/ a stranger. I've also read very positive and very negative reviews for both places. What place do you guys think is better? Thanks <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey everyone, I'm an incoming freshman who is planning his first move to campus in the next couple of weeks. Today, I signed up for a move-in slot and noticed that the Sunday/Monday options had significantly more time and were much more available. Are these options for people who are not able to attend welcome weekend? If I pick a move-in of either the Sunday or Monday before classes, will I miss out on the experience? Thanks for the help, and go blue!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello,  I am looking to find a graphic design student who can create a landing page for a new SAAS app digital notebook.  This is a one time project, but if the work goes well it will lead to ongoing work. Pay is commensurate based upon experience but I can tell you that I value good work and will pay well. My overall budget for the entire landing page is anywhere from 300 - 1000. Depends on how difficult the job is, but I would definitely be willing to pay for a difficult but amazing idea. We can discuss this.   It would be great if you also have an interest in business and marketing because I would love to hear your ideas about creating the best landing page for this product. The current landing page is a problem and does not make it easy for a new person to easily see the advantages of the product, or attract them to it within the first few seconds. If a user is not attracted, curious, or interested in the product in the first 10 seconds they usually move on. So the landing page needs to get straight to the point and attract the user to dig in more. You can view the app and current landing page here: [www.memrey.com]([url link]   Just message me if you are interested. Tell me about your experience and maybe send some sample work. If you have little experience I would still be open to working with you if you have a passion for design. I value simple, modern, beautiful designs.   Thanks! Look forward to hearing from you   <eos> \n",

I found 'PHIL 154', the philosophy of science fiction, and thought it looked interesting but I was looking for some first hand experience. Anyone who has taken the class, what's the work like? Is it a tough class? Also, if anyone has any other suggestions for 3 credit humanities or just non math/science classes I'd greatly appreciate your input. Thanks for any suggestions! <eos> \n",

I want to take a combination of two of the following classes: 485, 482, 388 and 376. Which of these classes are most likely to open up?  Waitlist: 485: 30 482: 100+ 388: ~7 376: ~3  I wanted to take 482 really badly because I heard it helps with recruiting and just looks incredible on a resume. I also really don't want to take 376 bc fuck 203.  Any help is appreciated. Thank you.  Edit: Random, but if anyone has any feedback on HISTART 272, that'd be greatly appreciated. <eos> \n",

In High School I was very used to having the textbook in my hands before entering class, and only 1 out of 5 of my classes have textbooks listed. Do I purchase textbooks as they are released on Wolverine Access? Is there an expectation to have textbooks the first day of class and I'm not looking in the right location?

Such as UT Dallas, UT San Antonio, etc.  So I am doing a study on school rankings in the U.S. and I am really confused when I see all the different universities in Michigan. I know there is Univ. of Michigan which probably the main one. But there are also Central Michigan Univ, West Michigan Univ, and East Michigan Univ?  So just wondering if they are related in any way so I could group them together.  Thanks,  EDIT: thank you all for the speedy response!   <eos> \n",

I have had horrible roommates in the past and thus I’m also stuck with the reality of living alone this year. I would really appreciate if people don’t comment here telling me to go get therapy or judge my post history. I know I’m struggling and I’m working on it.

I’m looking for girls as friends not because I have anything against guys it’s just the friendship I need right now. Please message me if you are interested  <eos> \n",

I'm not that great at math(I'm good, but compared to ppl who are like REALLY good I'm not very good) so I'm wondering if it would make sense to take it at Washtenaw instead?  One question I have is how to get to Washtenaw, I know that a lot of UMich students take classes at Washtenaw, how do they get there? I'm out of state so I don't have a car. Are there shuttles that go from U of M to Washtenaw?  <eos> \n",

I know I'll have my questions answered at orientation, but I was just wondering if anyone here has done it. Thanks! <eos> \n",

How the hell do you all afford it? Out of state tuition is around 52,000 a year, so is Michigan really generous with scholarships or something?  2. What's the social scene like? Is it mostly greek, or is it a lot of house parties and stuff? Are people usually pretty open? 3. Is there a lot of school spirit? Do people get excited for football/basketball games?  4. How challenging is it, academically? I've taken some pretty boring/easy classes in high school, and I'm hoping to avoid those in college. I'm LSA, undecided major.  5. What's the living situation? Do most people live on or off campus?  6. Are the classes huge? I come from a small high school (200 kids) and I've had classes with as few as 3 people. I'm not expecting anything like that in college, but will every class be a 500 person lecture? 7. What's the intramural scene like? I played a lot of sports in high school, but wasn't good enough to play D1. Is there a strong intramural/club sports scene? Particularly soccer and lacrosse. 8. I haven't visited, but from what I read online the campus seems huge. How do you get around? Do people bring cars, or is it more walking? Do a lot of students have bikes? Are there buses?  9. How easy is it to double major or add a minor or something? I'm not sure I want to tie myself down to just one major.  10. How easy/hard is it to switch colleges? I applied to LSA, but what if I find out I really want to go into Athletic training, or education, or pharmacy? 11. Last question. Do you, personally, like going to Michigan? If you had to pick again, is this where you would want to go to college?  Thank you so much!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm a senior EECS major but I haven't had any job or internship experience. My path to CS was definitely a bit fragmented, had to retake a couple courses after getting it together, changed majors twice, etc. I now have two semesters left to graduation (Dec '17) and am looking for an internship for the summer. Basically, I haven't felt like I was in a position to apply anywhere until now. So, I've got a semester of EECS upper levels under my belt (381 and 388 last semester), and I'm taking 482/484 at the moment. I'm wondering how I'll get on with applying places and talking to people if I have limited experience outside of my classes. Hoping that the experience in courses can be leveraged, but I know nowadays what you do outside of school is very important. Would you all happen to have any advice for this situation?

Is parking available or is it faster to just get around on foot/bike?  Are calc 2  3 as hard as I've heard? I'm in AP calc right now and I want to take the BC exam but I've heard that most people fail calc 2 or 3 if they go into either as a freshman. If so, is there anything I can do to prepare? Should I do my enrollment deposit as soon as possible? When should I apply for financial aid? Do I need a laptop? Will paper notes and a desktop suffice?  Is there a sibling discount or something similar? My sister also attends the university, does that benefit me in any way? <eos> \n",

I've already finished most of my prereqs, so next semester I was looking to take EECS 281, EECS 376 (or 370, though I heard 376 was easier), Math 214, and some 4 credit class to finish up my intellectual breadth reqs (prob SI 110). Is this too difficult? All of my semesters so far had low workloads, and while I've had the occasional difficult class (fuck you Physics 240), I feel like this would be a difficult transition. I haven't had much trouble with the previous CS courses though, so maybe it could be manageable? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello! So as the title says I was hoping someone who has lived in a similar arrangement (5+ people) could tell me a little bit about what it was like?  I've got a group of people who are all going to be attending the Ford School and we're looking at a 6 person house. I'm not excited about the prospect of living with 5 other people, as the house only comes with two bathrooms and a single kitchen. The rent is expected to be $583 per person, and its a short walk to the Ford School. I also have a dog, and with 5 people there it means someone is likely to be home at all times which is a good thing. However, I've been looking at other locations, and saw someone leasing a room for about $400 per month in an apartment about 10 minutes drive from the main campus, which doesn't seem to bad. This is for a 2 bedroom apartment. Is the ~$200 extra to live ON campus worthwhile? Are the parking passes expensive (haven't been able to locate a price for the year). And would being only 10 minutes away create difficulties driving to school if there is snow? Am I missing out on some sort of awesome experience by not being directly on campus?  Please let me know what you think! <eos> \n",

I was wondering if because of that I should elect to do the North Campus tour vs the standard Central Campus walking tour. Any thoughts? I can not be making both because I will be coming from my home state, Illinois, that day and the five hour drive is not conducive to the 10am start time of the morning tours. Thanks <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Vibration was far from what I could understand... I was bad even at calc4 which deals with similar thing. I feel like I got zero even though I wrote something, I don't think it is worth for partial credit. I got 50 on midterm1, 94 on midterm2, and did pretty well on homeworks and also received 2percent extra credit by answering survey. Do you think I can get C- in this course? Or something even worse like E? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am an incoming graduate student, starting in the fall. About three days ago I signed a housing contract for Northwood V (two bedroom+study, shared, unfurnished, $617 per month). Turns out that was really bad timing, as the very next day a friend of mine, who is already at UMich, told me that he needs an off campus roommate. Apparently the housing people are pretty strict about not cancelling contracts (being a legally binding document and all, sheesh), but they told me it would be possible to reassign it, provided that I find someone willing to take it. The portion of the contract I need to reassign is from August 15, 2013 to June 30, 2014, so roughly 11 months. I have already posted on the Contract Reassignment forum, but I thought a reddit post would also be a good idea. Message me if you are interested! TL;DR Need someone to reassign my Northwood V contract to. Edit: Changed the start/end dates of the contract reassignment. <eos> \n",

Also looking for some personal experiences with these classes. Was the class enjoyable? Workload? Beneficial to go to lecture? Would it possible to take all four of these classes and still enjoy my existence? My preference is 388, 376 and 475. Is taking 388 with 475 helpful/a bad idea? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I'm remedying the situation tomorrow for both minor releases, but I'm worried that I will not be able to walk since it's so late. Anyone have any words of advice? Who to talk to to get it pushed through on time? Did anyone else apply late like this? How did it work? <eos> \n",

I have been trying to get my subjects for the Fall Term and since I am not from UMich I am not sure if the workload would be appropriate. (I have already checked Rate My Proffesors and the contents of the courses). As of now I would take: * **EECS 477** Intro to Algorithms * **EECS 475** Intro to Cryptography * **EECS 494** Computer Game Design  Development * **EECS 573** Microarchitecture I was also considering **EECS 351** (Digital Signal Processing), **EECS 482** (Intro to Operating Systems) and **EECS 587** (Parallel Computing) if the waitlists for some of the previous do not turn out well. I would be in my senior year and I have a good basis in the majority of the topics related to EECS. So what are your thoughts, not humanly possible, feasible or walk in the park? Any info related to the subjects would be a great help Thanks for your time EDIT: I am taking EECS 494 as an upper-elective not as my MDE <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey everyone! A little background:  I took eecs 183 last semester. I am enrolled in eecs 280, math 295 this fall. I also wanted to enroll in eecs 203 because not doing so would push back me taking eecs 281 another semester *to next fall*.  I am confident that I am ready for enrollment in eecs 203. I put in a permission request stating that but it was denied. I then decided to take a Math 115 class this upcoming summer half-term. But that comes with its own problem: 1. All the sublets I have seen till now have the move out date as August 18-19. I won't have a place to live for 10 days. As of now I see my only options as- 1. Taking 203 this winter, and then 280 the next fall.  2. Taking Math 115 this upcoming summer term, and live in a hotel or something for the next 10 days. Any advice is appreciated. It's 3 weeks to the start of classes and I could really use some help figuring this out. Thank you :)  <eos> \n",

Hopefully I made the right choice. I’m excited but I’m also really nervous that I won’t be able to make friends and stuff although I do know a lot of people already at Umich. Living off campus with some close friends, and I’m planning on rushing frats but I hope that not living in the dorms my freshman year in AA will put me in a spot where I won’t be able to meet as many people and stuff. Idk I’m kinda over analyzing tbh but yeah. Just feeling really anxious about the social life especially knowing how many friends I had at MSU  Edit: I’m only taking EECS 280, and 8 other credits that are easy this semester  <eos> \n",

Most of my friends are out of state and I haven’t had the chance to make good friends with my new co-workers yet. I'm a software engineer at a start-up.  I love going to bars, playing tennis, racquet ball, going to concerts, cooking, and playing the guitar. I’m not weird or an asshole (Check my profile history if you want lol).  If you’re at a similar point in life feel free to PM me or just comment below.  Thanks, Yanni <eos> \n",

If I were to talk to my teacher and admit to wrong doing, is it possible they would just dock my grade for that project and not go to the honor council? I don't want to bring down other students for a mistake I had made when I was feeling low. Does anyone have good advice? Thanks. <eos> \n",

I currently have a 65% in the class. I understand the web hw, but the TA teaching the class is a little all over the place. I've heard other people complain about him and apparently the class average on the last quiz we had was a 25%, which makes me think maybe its more the teacher and less the content of the class? Idk, maybe I'm just bad at calc. I'm scared for this exam. I really don't want to start my freshman year out by failing the first test I have. What can I do to prepare? Also, on the first day of class we were told that we would not be taught everything that was going to be on the test. What type of questions should I expect? <eos> \n",

I am very talented at econ and got an A in econ 101, and I am considering switching to that. Would it be better to switch to my passions or is the financial difference of a CS major and an Econ major that different, even if my CS GPA sucks ass?

There is never gym space at the CCRB on weekdays after 5pm or over the weekends, and Rec sports closes the IM building whenever undergrads are on break. There’s a lot of students that live in A2 year round. It would be nice if they had better hours at the IM building. It’s the best gym on campus. /rant <eos> \n",

Have any of you guys taken it or heard anything about these classes in terms of workload and material difficulty? pecifically 389, because the course description seems extremely broad.

However, if I stay at my current school, I will graduate next year.

I've already met with Student Legal Services and figured out generally what's going to happen. However, I was told that my court documents and other information on the case may end up going to my home address which is troublesome because: 1) I won't be there to pick them up and 2) My parents don't deserve the stress of finding out. Don't get me wrong, I'll tell them eventually, but I'd rather work this all out first so they don't have to worry about my future being endangered in any way. Is there anything I can do to make sure things go to my temporary address here on campus? <eos> \n",

I am considering transferring to your school for a couple of reasons and was wondering if you guys could give me an insight on whether or not I have a chance at being accepted. I want to apply for Fall of '15 since I will finish my pre-reqs (Calc III, Diff Eq, Programming (MatLab)) this Fall and want to finish the year at ASU.  **Academics** * 3.8 Cumulative GPA (both in college and in HS) * 1880 SAT (~1300 without the writing section) * 28 ACT * Dean's List twice at ASU **Extracurriculars** * Co-Founder/Vice President of a music and live performance group (pretty much a rock band) * Member of SAE Baja team for a semester. I plan on joining the SAE Formula team this upcoming year. * Coached a Pop Warner football team for a summer. * I play in my Church's band. **Misc.** * I already have an internship set up for next summer at home (California. I know, why would I leave California haha) but it's not official yet so I don't think I can add that anywhere. * I have a good relationship with one of my math professors and could ask him to write an evaluation/recommendation if that would help.  **Reasons** * The main reason is to hopefully be accepted into the SUGS program for the Master's of Automotive Engineering. But even if I don't get into the SUGS program, I would still attempt to apply for the Master's after getting my BSE. * UofM has a better reputation than ASU. Currently, I would love to work internationally, and I believe that UofM is more internationally renown than ASU. I'm not saying anything bad about ASU, but it's a fact that UofM is higher ranked for engineering. * I have a lot of family in Michigan that I have only met once, and it would be nice to be close to them for a couple of years. I'm already planning out my Spring semester so that I only take courses that will transfer (I'm supposed to take thermofluids in the spring, but it won't transfer over) so my schedule doesn't rely on me getting accepted. I can't find a date for when Fall '15 applications open, so should I apply after my Fall semester, or after my Spring semester? Thanks for taking the time to read through this, and let me know if I missed any information. Have a good day!   <eos> \n",

I am currently signed up for four science classes totaling 13 credits and was not originally planning on taking a fifth class. I've realized, though, that taking a fifth easier class might be helpful in buffering my GPA before I graduate this spring.  I would only be willing to take a fifth class if it is quite easy. I'm looking for something that I can spend almost no time on outside of class (~1 hour per week maybe). I'm open to classes from all departments. Does anyone know of any classes like this? <eos> \n",

I plugged my cable into my TV, and all I get is the Michigan channel. It's an older TV (about 2007) but I see no reason it shouldn't work. Also, I am trying to watch Netfix and use other internet applications on my PS3, but it won't let me use MWireless and when I try to hook up my ethernet cord and run a setup of my network on the PS3, it obtains the ip address but then the internet connection test fails.

The problem: I want to become an investment banker, an unfeasible goal coming from my university. I currently have a 3.8 overall GPA and completed 39 credits BEFORE my sophomore year. (with an upward trend in grades) notable classes: Macroecon (4.0), Calculus (4.0), Comp II (4.0) and my lowest grade: Microecon (3.5 first semester) I consistently volunteer as an IT consultant (over 100 hours and counting) at Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit (I extracted mass amounts of data from the food bank's Outlook calendars and organized it into Excel spreadsheets along with other IT tasks) I currently work at my school's Bloomberg Terminal computer lab and have a good understanding of its functions. I generally have a better understanding of finance than most students my age (i.e. DCF, EBITDA, and other comps). I also run a small car-customization service, tutor students, and mentor a student with Asperger's syndrome. I know the Ross School of Business has a low acceptance rate even for students coming from Umich undergrad.  What can I do to enhance my application? What are my chances of making the cut? Can anyone give me tips/advice to improve? Any response would help. please hear me out; It is my dream to attend Ross and become an Investment Banker, and I'm not some kid who decided this after watching \"the Wolf of Wallstreet\"  <eos> \n"

Studied my ass off for the exam, completely bombed the 215 exam. 100% know that I'm not going to pass the exam, and possibly even the course. As for 270, I'm not sure how I did, but I still bombed the second midterm. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of interest, or because I don't study enough (even though I studied my ass off).

When I entered college, I planned on doing IOE, since I always heard it was more business based. I'm not trying to switch to IOE just cus it's easier, but because it seems to be more business-like. Currently, I wish I was a business major, not an engineering major, but it's too late for that.

I plan on taking the MCAT after my Winter semester of my junior year and need to plan my schedule for the Fall.

It looks like Chez Betty is going to stay open! Here's the email: Dear all, This morning, representatives from the Chez Betty Team, CSE, CoE, and the Provost’s Office, including Provost Paul Courant, met to discuss the future of Chez Betty. We came together with the same goal, “How do we enable Betty to continue while meeting appropriate state and federal requirements?” We are thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement that gives Betty a path to continue operating and addresses the administration’s concerns. Betty will close temporarily at the end of the term in order to incorporate, obtain insurance and a state retail food establishment license, and handle various other compliance needs. We plan to reopen as soon as possible after that, once we have all of these things in place--hopefully by Betty’s next birthday in early July. This outstanding resolution happened because so many of you--students, alumni, staff, faculty, and deans--reached out and made your voices heard. We are grateful for your support as well as the partnership of the Provost’s Office for responding in such a timely and positive manner. This solution reaffirms Michigan’s support for student-driven problem solving and entrepreneurship. It’s also a reflection of what the North Campus community (and the central administration) can accomplish when we come together. We wish everyone the best of luck with the end of the term. Forever Go Blue (and Go Betty!), -Brad, Pat,  Zakir and Frances Mueller (Provost’s Office) Edit: For those out of the loop, check out the [first post]([url link] and the [second post]([url link] about Chez Betty. <eos> \", '<bos> Thanks! <eos> ', '<bos> I’m a freshman and I would like to take both winter semester but I’ve been told that this isn’t a good idea since they’re two very different types of thinking, 116 is a weeder, both have heavy workloads, etc.  I just want to get some more perspectives on this so I don’t make the wrong choice.

I get the sentiment and the idea of a big thread for all these questions seems good in theory, but in reality no one is going through those threads (or at least not nearly as many people as the front page). It’s not like this subreddit gets spammed with posts, there’s only ever a few posts a day, so I don’t think it’s a huge problem to have a couple more. I personally have no issue with people coming to the subreddit and posting their own questions as a separate post, and I think that’d be a lot more helpful to them than the megathread approach.  <eos> ', \"<bos> I've heard people mention matlab, python, and c++.

We purposefully leased a house on South Campus this year because we were a house of eight active guys who enjoy playing pick-up sports and wanted to be close to field space. The University ended up fencing off the whole park and closed everything down until the summer because they didn't want to pay people to staff the field. Now I can't play soccer or anything when I get off work because they lease the space to look youth organizations. Does this piss anyone else off? Maybe this is being fueled by my preexisting hatred for Rec Sports (another issue entirely) but I feel that a part of my tuition should be reimbursed for them taking back some of the resources to which I was expecting access. **TL,DR - I want access to Elbel Field and feel that the University is cutting corners to make a quick buck.** <eos> \", \"<bos> If you left your phone in Med Sci 2 on december 8th I have it and am going to carry it on me til the end of my shift here at 130am.

However recently, my immune system has gotten really weak so my body is really susceptible to infections I could get from others around me. My physician recommended I get a single instead of the economy double since it would help protect me a little better.

And even with the other clubs I have applied for, such as a dance team I've auditioned for, I've heard nothing.

My parents have been wanting me to try and transfer to U of M since its generally a better school and closer to home. My sister transferred there from depaul university her sophmore year with a 26 on her ACT and a 4.0 cumilative gpa in high school. I on the other hand am halfway through my freshmen year and got a 1170 on the sat and graduated high school with a 3.5. My question is basically is it worth applying to u of m even though im more than likely not gonna get in? I know that it can't hurt to apply but I really dont want to write multiple essays and pay an application fee just to end up getting denied. I do know that after you get a certain amount of college credits universities dont look at your high school scores/gpa I currently have 43 credits and I do have a pretty good personal statement that can back up why my grades/test scores arent up to standard during high school and my sister is willing to help me with the application process.

The Michigan Cycling team is a Club Sport who competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference. Other teams in our conference include MSU, OSU, Notre Dame, Indiana, Wisconsin, Purdue, Illinois, Case Western, Louisville, Northwestern, Cincinatti, Marquette, Miami (NTM), and a bevy of other small schools. Our conference also features a few schools that consider cycling a varsity sport including Marian and Lindenwood. The kit order is once again live and this year they're added a couple more options. These are the same exact uniforms that the team will be racing in next spring.  More information about the team can be found here: [url link] Prices do tend to run a bit high, but such is the nature of being a small fish in the big pond of paying university royalties and the like. Any proceeds go towards helping get team member's to races and most importantly nationals. Also, we have switched vendors this year, and expect a massive step up in quality, as well as slightly reduced prices, so this is the year to order if you've been hesitant in the past! The order closes on October 15th, and the kits will be delivered to you in mid-November. Please note that because this is a custom order, there is no returns. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Some background info: I'll be arriving at the States and doing my immigration thingy at Chicago O' Hare International Airport at 10 AM, and then I'll have to catch a flight to Detroit International Airport (transit time is 3 hours) which will land at around 3 PM. 1. Will the immigration procedure take much time? 3 hours doesn't seem like much, and I'm afraid of the possibility of missing my next flight to Detroit. What can I do then? 2.

It is a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house with lots of parking and a storage shed (I'm going to keep a motorcycle in there, but it's big enough for a lot more). We're going for 3 roommates because one of the rooms is a bit small, and we'd rather that be an office/workroom/music room.  About us: My friend and I are both 4th year engineering PhD students. We'll be driving/biking/riding/busing into North Campus pretty much every day. He has a cat, is relatively quiet, vegetarian, French, and he is a joy to be around. I'm a big movie person, techie, gamer, absolutely not a vegetarian, and beer drinker. We're both very considerate about noise, cleanliness, and house rules. Neither of us are huge party people, but might have people over every once in a while. I go between hosting board game nights, LANs, beer tastings, and movie nights at my current place.  The rent is $800/month/person, and I'm guessing utilities(gas, electric, water)and internet will be no more than 50-80 over that per person.  What we're looking for in a roommate: clean, fun, and considerate. Gender doesn't matter. If you have a pet, you'll split the landlord's pet fee with my friend (it's 240/year if you have any pets). When we signed the lease, we added a clause to add a 3rd roommate at a later date. If you're interested, PM me and I can send you some pictures of the place. We can also arrange for you to go see the place with the landlord. Lastly, we can meet up for a beer to make sure we're all compatible as people.

We've also both bought Orange passes and park on North campus. ________________________________________ However, there's a few stupid rules that I'm wondering about. The first of which being that you cannot park on North campus Orange lots for more than 48 hours.  My roommate actually just emailed parking services about this, because we are storing our cars on these lots overnight, and they said that yes, every 48 hours you must move to a different Orange lot.. ________________________________________ There are two Orange lots right near each other on North, so technically we can just move from lot to lot.. but it takes honestly about an hour and a half just to do this, we live pretty far away on South, but we HAVE to park on North because you're not allowed to store your cars overnight on the South lots. ________________________________________ Does anybody have experience with this? How does the parking police check to see if your car has been on a specific lot longer than 48 hours? We both have to have our cars on campus, and we use them about once a week. So having to run over to North campus to drive our cars 100 feet to the other lot seems a little stupid. ________________________________________ Do the parking police honestly check this? Or do they just check to see if you have an Orange pass in your windshield? Any insight to parking with these orange student passes would be greatly appreciated.

I live in London, UK, so this would mean quite a lot to me and would be a great opportunity to meet academics in a different continent. Unfortunately at the moment I'm seeing a nurse several times per week in the UK, and this would need to continue in the USA.

Umich is the better option for me financially but I'm still undecided because of a few concerns.

Is it hard to do well? -I'm looking at majoring in poli sci and doubling it with either a communications or economics degree. Is that hard to do at umich as a transfer? How hard is it to get into the Ross Minor? -Is the large size of the school ever overwhelming? -I'm from Michigan so I'm familiar with Ann Arbor, but now that I go to school near a large East coast city, I'm concerned that A2 would be boring.

Most likely alley now (to not bump myself from 12 to 16 eecs credits) is doing a directed study for one credit; anyone have experience or advice on how to go about this? As a transfer (and a struggling student at the beginning) I don't have a ton of faculty relationships, but I do have a professor who has had me twice as a student (not strong...but definitely present) as well as one who knows me outside the classroom. Both do research in areas I'm interested in working; should I look into current research and have a project idea in mind to ask them about their assistance, or go blind and ask if they're working on anything? <eos> \", '<bos> Anyone ever joined or heard about the Michigan Research Community?

I am a current freshman engineering student who is looking to transfer to lsa next semester.  I am still exploring majors, and am curious as to how the economics major is. I went to a technical academy for engineering in high school , but also took classes in other subjects. I really enjoyed economics and biology, and those are the fields I am currently interested in.  So to those econ students, how are you liking the major? I know it is hard, everything is here.  <eos> ', '<bos> Hi! I got accepted into University of Michigan and am highly considering going there. I understand how the semester system works (very simple which is good :)), but I was wondering, how accurate is the credit hour number in terms of workload (i.e. are all 4.0 cred classes similar workload to each other, same with 3.0 and 2.0)?

Unfortunately, the class has turned out to be more time-consuming than I originally thought due to my heavy courseload. Does anyone know if the pass/fail deadline has not passed yet?

I have lived in university housing for the past three years with the same roommate that I know really well. My roommate is graduating at the end of the winter semester, and I need to find housing--and a roommate--for next year. I am worried about continuing with university housing because I'm extremely nervous about roomming with a stranger in a one-bedroom Northwood apartment. I'm thinking about living in off-campus housing for the 4th year, but there's a chance that I may graduate early at the end of Fall 2016...unless I want to do grad school in Winter 2017...really not sure. My question is: If I looked into an apartment for next year on North campus like at Willowtree, what are the complications of roomming for Fall only...and finding a somebody to take my spot in the Winter? How hard is it to find other people who are looking for Winter-only sublets--if there are any? Is there a way I can live off campus for just the Fall semester if I wanted to...?

I'm used to the undergraduate social life where you get thrown in to a dorm with a bunch of other people studying the same things, and friendships just form out of thin air with no effort whatsoever. I'm aware it probably won't be that easy at graduate school, but how drastic is the change here? Will I have to resign to going out once a week to meet with acquaintances, or is it common to develop a strong friend circle here? Do graduate students usually end up living together or close to each other? Also, this may be a long shot, but is there any sort of hustle dancing group around the university?

I took AP econ in HS and it was a breeze (got A's and 5's on the tests without trying too hard), but my AP credit doesn't let me place out of the course according to the website. 1) Is there any way to place out of the course without IB HL Econ? Like a placement test? or just badgering the department? 2) How bored will I be if I end up taking the 101/102 course? Does it go significantly beyond AP?

Basically the program is designed so that I'll get my associates degree and my high school diploma (for free) at the same time, technically a year after my senior year but it's designed a certain way to make it work out the right credits I'll need for high school as well being able to around 62 credits with me to a different college I choose to go to. Now I won't be doing applying until next fall, and I mention this since I'll have an abundance of credits (44-62 depends on what schools accept what) I'll only need to do about 2 years of school after I have finished this program. One of the schools I was considering was U of M Dearborn, I have a decent chance of getting accepted (little to no chance of getting into Ann Arbor) but I have heard from other seniors that if you go to Dearborn or Flint campuses, after two years you're able to go to Ann Arbor for your remaining years. I wasn't sure how exactly it works, if it's an automatic optional thing or you have to reach a certain GPA at flint or Dearborn or depending on your major. Two majors I'm considering are Computer Science (Programming in particular) or Nursing. Would I have a chance at transferring from Dearborn to Ann Arbor even with the additional credits? Should I maybe call the Dearborn or Ann Arbor campus to get more information?  tl;dr I will attend a university with 50-62 college credits, I wanna be able to attend Dearborn and possibly transferring Ann Arbor, how does it work and does it work for my situation?  <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm from CoE and I'm thinking to take linear algebra next semester.

Going from a 50% acceptance rate to under 25% in just eight years seems absolutely crazy. It's understandable that admissions are getting more competitive since more and more students go to college each year, but the change is far greater than I would have guessed.

And MSU appears as a bit of an outlier but it can be explained by their enrollment numbers. They've started accepting far more people each year to increase their enrollment size. I'm guessing they're trying to grow their class size quicker than they're trying to become more selective (something some would debate Michigan should do).

I have been reinstated to the College of Engineering to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering. I will be taking Chem 230, Math 215, and one intellectual breadth course. Unfortunately, despite passing Calc III with a B+ in community college, the course was just evaluated by Michigan and will not transfer. I am required to earn a 3.3 this semester to regain good standing in the College of Engineering, as well as fulfill a bevy of other requirements. 1. Besides spending hours (many, many hours) per week studying, a skill I have been cultivating and improving, what other steps should I take to learn the material? I have incorporated office hours and group study sessions into my repertoire in the last couple semesters, and I imagine these will continue to be useful. Any specific study strategies? Study locations? 2. Any suggestions for intellectual breadth? Honestly, I want to find an interesting class, but one perhaps not as intensive if possible. I hate to use the term \"GPA booster\", but I would not mind having a slightly easier class as insurance in case I struggle in Chem or Math. 3. What resources can I avail myself of in the college of engineering? I am looking for professors, other students that perhaps could help me, or even tutors. I am confident in myself, but I want to do everything possible to achieve success with my second (and last!) chance. 4. I hope this does not sound needy, but would anyone here be willing to help me as I transition back into Michigan? Seriously, even just someone to talk to. I know a few people still at Michigan, but I will not have a massive circle of friends. So, I would appreciate anyone that might be willing to help. Thank you to any and all that may offer advice.

Which school is harder to get admitted to? I heard if you did IGR in undergrad (the classes, or commonground, or both?), you get preferential admissions to the MSW program. How hard is it once you're in the MSW program, is it much harder than undergrad, or no? I see the MSW doesn't require a GRE, but the Education school requires a GRE, so is the school or ed harder to get into, or not necessarily, or are these about equal and are not as hard to get into as Umich professional schools such as medical, or law, or MBA? How hard is this to get into vs the MBA, or the Master of Management if you're a Umich undergrad, or is the MSW and School of Ed not terribly had to get into for a masters, and do either of these programs require an interview, or no?  I see there's an MSW/Law joint option, but no Education/Law joint degree. Speaking of joint degrees, if you complete your first masters at Umich, and you go on to professional school such as an MBA or Law, can some credits from your masters transfer over, so you have less time/requirements for your professional degree, as would be the case if you're doing a joint degree, like the joint law programs, or no, the credits from your masters dont' count, since you did it seperately?

A food prep employee was asking if he/she needed to make more sandwiches for the display case. The response was – No, not unless we sell out.

I left behind a son who is currently a senior at UofM and brought my younger 2 with me to North Carolina. Fast forward to now. Son #2 is now going through the college selection/application process. He applied EA to both UofM and UNC Chapel Hill, and was admitted to both, hence the quandary.  Some facts: * Kid bleeds Maize and Blue since elementary school. Michigan was always his dream. * He left MI after his freshman year at Grand Blanc High School, and is therefore not eligible for in-state tuition. * It takes him a long time to make friends. He had lived in Grand Blanc since pre-school. The first year after moving, he ate alone in the cafeteria of Ardrey Kell HS for the entire year. * None of his Michigan friends were accepted to UofM. * His Charlotte friends were accepted to either NC Chapel Hill, or NC State, which is close by. * Chapel Hill guarantees 100% of unmet need for in-state students, while Michigan does not do so for out of state enrollees. * USNWR rankings have the two institutions basically equivalent, but the QS World University Rankings have Michigan ahead by a mile. * No one asked me about my college or GPA after my first year in the labor market. * This will probably not be his terminal degree. He is interested in Medicine or Biostatistics going forward. Admission to a good graduate program is important. I guess that I am looking for some points of view to allow me to present the pros and cons to my son in a fair fashion. My personal preference is keep him closer to home and spend less money.

I came into UMich as a Freshman in the RC this fall, but left mid-semester in November due to a bunch of personal reasons. I took online classes from a community college this semester, and am 95% sure I'll be returning to campus this fall, again in the RC.

I was very excited, especially since I would like to take it as work-study rather than having to get another job for laundry money and such (I worked for Dining and did not enjoy it). I was wondering what your experience was with UROP. I want to do psychology research, I think, but am pretty open-minded. How was the work load? Did you find it valuable? Any tips/advice? If you took it for work-study, how was the pay? I know the paychecks probably won't be all that much, but did it seem worth it to take it for work-study rather than for credit?

I had planned to work more full time when I was looking at CC, but now that I will be going to UoM I would like to make that my primary focus. So money will be a bigger factor.  How is the traffic around Ann Arbor? Since we will be looking more outside of the city to save on costs I will be commuting in for school. My car is great on gas, so that isn't a worry. I would just like to get a rough idea on what the commute will be like. How is working while going to school? Are there decent jobs in the area for students?

This was the course schedule I was thinking about.

It's very important for me to bring the cat, but not so much the dog. Dog is very friendly and gets along with everyone, so in worst-case scenario she can go to my sister's.

It took her about a year to fully get used to me, so I don't think she'll be too happy being in a new surrounding without me.

I am admitted to LSA and intend to do CS. I am really keen on playing squash. I have been playing since the last five years and I do not want to stop playing. It would be great if anyone would provide information about the squash facilities on the campus and if there any clubs or competitions for the sport.

Any current students/recent graduates care to weigh in?** Hey all. Question for those in the School of Information. I left the University ~7 years ago after being disappointed with the academic culture within the social sciences as well as piss-poor employment opportunities for History majors. 2008 and debts from a major reconstructive surgery didn\\'t help, either.  I\\'m seriously considering re-enrolling post-Go Blue Guarantee and am really interested in software development. That being said, an applied maths degree and intensive algorithmic design aren\\'t my interest nor my strong suit, so CS would be something of a gambit. I\\'ve spent my time away from UMich as a hobbyist programmer, media production and graphic designer, and consummate front-end monkeyer who\\'s picked up some back-end knowledge along the way and the BSI looks very appealing, especially the UX Design and Information Analytics concentrations.  Back when I was attending, Informatics (which I guess isn\\'t a thing anymore?) was still a relatively young major and all my friends in the program were required to take only one programming course: EECS 182, which I guess is now SI106 and taught entirely in Python instead of C++. In that respect, the BSI seems to have far more programming options geared towards data analytics and web development than Informatics did, which are my primary interests. However, scanning the employment outcomes for BSI grads, I found that while there are a number of people in UI/UX Design and a handful of Front-End Developers, the vast majority seem to become consultants of some sort for large institutions like Deloitte or IBM - cogs in the corporate machine and paper pushers, from what it seems. (No offense to anyone who wants that, it\\'s just not for me.)  Moreover, when comparing U of M\\'s curriculum with other iSchools (University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon, etc.) I\\'m left with the impression that similar programs across the country are far stronger in their \"technical\" curriculum with UMich aiming more for the research/theory/social sciences angle. Perhaps the BSI curriculum could be supplemented with EECS courses/a CS minor? Any current/recent BSI students care to weigh in?

I would be concentrating in one of those two and I know Michigan is ranked very highly for both, but what is the quality of the actual professors in the classroom?

I just wanted to take some time to point out a wholly embarrassing occurrence on the diag going on right now. We have a man and his mission team, promoting their Christian faith, while a much larger group of students crowd around with the express intent to bring down his image of himself and his church, and are doing everything in their power to mock and intimidate him. They are standing as close as they can to him, yelling in his ears, and getting in his way.  Though I no longer subscribe to a faith, I believe that this is appalling. We in this country are entitled to free expression of faith and right now a large group of our leaders and best are intently using infantile and aggressive methods to communicate with this man instead of perhaps speaking to him, or better yet abstaining from interacting with him at all. Most frustrating is the fact that when the Palestine/Israel conflict flares up here, we allow the Palestinians to have vast protests free of combat. Their grief stems from religion, yet we selectively allow them to go harassment free.  Is the opportunity to attack a small group of Christians instead of a big one the reason you all are doing this today? If so you are cowards. Is it because you believe Islam has more legitimacy than Christianity? If so you are bias and spiteful. Either way you cut it, these are not the actions of the kinds of people we want in this school.  If you saw, took part, or have questions, feel free to post. We are adults here, we all need to act like it.  <eos> ', \"<bos> I'm not very comfortable with deep waters so was wondering about the depth of the pool before going for a swim.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Hi all, I'm an Earth major, and was told by quite a few people at the alumni panel recently that knowing Python and some data science makes you a much more competitive job applicant for industry jobs.

The Michigan Cycling team is a Club Sport who competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference. Other teams in our conference include MSU, OSU, Notre Dame, Indiana, Wisconsin, Purdue, Illinois, Case Western, Louisville, Northwestern, Cincinatti, Marquette, Miami (NTM), and a bevy of other small schools. Our conference also features a few schools that consider cycling a varsity sport including Marian and Lindenwood. The kit order is once again live and this year they're added a couple more options. These are the same exact uniforms that the team is currently racing in. More information about the team can be found here: [url link] Prices do tend to run a bit high, but such is the nature of being a small fish in the big pond of paying university royalties and the like. Any proceeds go towards helping get team member's to races and most importantly nationals. The order closes on April 11th, and the kits will be delivered to you in mid May.

Just wondering - is this true, and if so, what may be the reason(s) for this? Or is the dislike of chinese international students just prevalent in most US universities? And are attitudes towards Chinese Americans different to that of Chinese internationals students?

When did you hear back regarding financial aid and such? 2.

This semester I'm taking 13 credits: Spanish, Chemistry 130, Bio 173 (Bio lab), and a first year writing seminar. I also worked on average 11 hours a week in the dining hall and I think I managed well, though it was a bit rough around midterm time. Next semester, I'm taking 18 credits: psych 111, chem 125/126 (chem lab), Arabic 102, stats 250, and English 298 (intro to literary studies). Because freshmen register last, my schedule basically goes from 8-4 everyday (with some breaks in between). I've never been good at math and I'm scared for the chem lab because I've heard it can be really tough. My question is: should I quit my job? I don't need the money or anything, but my concern is that employers will look down on me for quitting.

Since a 1-0 win on Dec. 3 at Alaska, Hunwick has posted a 16-3-1 record with four shutouts, a 1.48 goals-against average and a .950 save percentage. During that span, he helped Michigan to the 2011 Great Lakes Invitational championship, stopped a career-high 46 shots in a 4-0 win at Ohio State on Jan. 13, and led the Wolverines to a two-game sweep of Notre Dame in the CCHA Quarterfinals, allowing just two goals in two games.

I have a few questions regarding life in general. I will be an international student, in case that influences anything. 1. What type of city is Ann Arbor? What are the choices for entertainment or recreation? I particularly like hiking and being around nature. What are the viable opportunities? 2. Does the EECS department host an open-house for graduate fellowship students? 3. What is the cost of living/housing? How hard is it to find housing? I have a fellowship offer, but I'm not sure how much that pays yet. Can anyone enlighten me? 4. Some dept-specific questions:  a) What is the state of research funding available to the EECS dept?  b) How many students does the dept. fund per professor?  c) How common is it for professors to fund conference visits?  d) What are the internship and future job opportunities like compared to other research universities (eg.

I am working on a few applications and am looking for a really good front-end dev to help with UI/UX and graphics.  I am interested in finding a front-end developer to work with to create html  css templates for 3 different web and mobile apps.  I only need the front-end html  css pages developed and I will connect up all the backend services. I have laid out all the features I need into a rough design but I need a really good designer (who can also write front end code) to help me make these apps look and work really really well.  The apps categories are: 1) Cloud Note taking / Bookmarking Application With Collaboration features and public sharing options. demo: [url link] Basically need help with UI/UX and graphics here.  2) Photobook app to create realtime cloud photobooks.  3) Flashcard Quiz App  This is a chance to work on a fun creative product that is also very useful. These app will have powerful modern features including single page (no page reloads), and realtime (all data pushed to each client). I am using the Meteor.js framework to create the app.  If you are interested please PM me with your information and links to some previous work you've done. Then we can chat in more detail about each project and you can quote me a price for each project. I prefer fixed price contract for these. The front-end code needs to be completely responsive and work on desktop and mobile.

I found a few threads about this topic on google, but they were all old and the chapters seem to vary greatly between different campuses (as expected). I heard that TBP is more selective (top 1/8 of CoE students) than HKN (top 1/4 of EECS students), but since HKN is more specific to my major, they are equally appealing to me. Depending on the mass meetings and responses here, I may decide to join both.

Michigan resident (East Coast transplant) who wants to get a graduate degree in something outside of business for a variety of personal reasons. Unlike NYU/Columbia, etc., where plenty of people will go to night/weekend courses to do this (think Wall Street guy who wants to learn about art history), Ann Arbor graduate programs appear to be only towards those who want to do research, teach, or become a PHD. So I looked on the Rackham website and they do offer a Master of Liberal Studies at UM Flint, which I could probably commute to without a huge problem. The issue is, the degree is from Rackham but the diploma would say UM-Flint. Now, I am mid-career so not looking to make some gigantic life change, but would like a degree of the caliber of NYU/Columbia/UCLA-level, which Ann Arbor certainly is. I said to Rackham, \"when you get an MBA from Ann Arbor, it is from Ross, but an MBA from UM Flint is not. Is \"Rackham, Rackham\", no matter where it comes from\". And they were not able to give be a conclusive answer.  Again, I am not looking to get on a road where I am going to get a masters degree/PHD so I can teach philosophy to the world, it\\'s more a learning for the desire to learn that is driving me. So if anyone has any insight, would a Rackham degree from UM Flint be a UM degree with an \"asterisk\"? Or, maybe there are some UM Ann Arbor graduate programs that can be done on weekend/nights. I do know the School of Education has a digital media program that includes communications, etc. that can be done part time, but not sure of all the requirements.

I am a rising sophomore, and a couple days out from going back to Michigan for my sophomore year, I must say, while I am excited to go back, I am also really nervous. I can't really put my finger on why I am nervous, because I had a great Freshman year. But, for some reason, I am super nervous. Perhaps it is because I got so used to being at home again because Michigan's summers are so long, and thus subconsciously feel like I am going to school for the first time? I'm not sure.

Honestly while the project is really cool, I've been finding it really difficult to get involved simply because my major is CE and none of the electronics work starts on the car really until next semester and every time I go into the Wilson centre to work, it seems like there isn't a significant amount for me to do because most people already have projects going on. Also, the team keeps saying that I should be spending close to 5 hours a day in the shop if I really want to benefit from being part of the team which is just time I really can't commit. Anyway, I was wondering what Design-Build-Test teams have a decent number of projects an EECS major could get involved in, which also have a bit more of a structured design and build process (i.e. fixed build times to work on the parts) and would be useful for my resumé and for finding internships later? My passion is still with cars and vehicles, and I would really look forward to working with autonomous vehicles in the future. I'd be willing to commit about 5 to 7 hours a week to the team.

How does it compare to 482? In a past semester I took 482 with a 16-credit semester (including eecs 388, stats 250, and history 101). This semester i was pretty busy, mostly with 482, but it wasn't horrible. Is 381 significantly more time consuming than 482 or is it comparable? I could take it next fall with a 12-credit semester and make my other 8 credits really easy humanities courses, but from what I hear i'd still be swamped and have a miserable semester.

A couple days ago, I went into this store to buy two 40s (I normally get alcohol from Meijer, but this was going to be a small purchase and I didn\\'t want to drive). None of the 40s had prices, so I just picked two that I knew to be cheap (Olde English), and brought them to the counter. He rang them up at $4.50 each, which is a huge mark-up over normal price but whatever I was in a hurry. I gave the cashier my card, he quickly scanned it and gave it back, then waited for my receipt. After about 10 seconds of talking to his friend who was there with him, he looks back at me clearly annoyed that I\\'m still there and says \"you can go now.\" Figuring that it\\'s a small purchase anyway, I don\\'t bother to demand a receipt. However, when I checked my charge history the next day, I found out that he had actually charged me $11.00, $2 more than what he\\'d shown me when he rang me up. Now, I\\'m out two bucks and have no receipt to show that I was actually supposed to be charged $9, so I can\\'t contest it. The combination of the facts that they don\\'t have the price anywhere until they ring you up, don\\'t give you a receipt, and overcharged me leads believe to believe this was not accidental. I suspect they\\'re deliberately upcharging certain customers believing the customer won\\'t bother to contest a $1.00 or $2.00 mischarge.

I am very passionate about mathematics, and I hope to someday be a research mathematician. The 295-396 intro sequence in particular was a big reason why I wanted to come to Michigan. I have a few questions for those who have taken it, though. 1. For the first year, at least, they call it \"Honors Math I/II\" rather than naming the classes after a specific topic. Also, I\\'ve read/heard varying things about what the specific content of the classes contains - some say it\\'s strictly theoretical calc first semester, linear algebra second semester, etc. Others say that they mix in different topics and give more of a broad introduction to mathematics. Which of these would you say is more accurate? 2. Assuming one works hard both in and outside of class, how soon can undergraduates get involved in research? I guess this applies to the math major in general, but I\\'m specifically wondering wondering how well this sequence would prepare me to do something such as an REU. Is it realistic to try and get one after freshman year? 3. Besides research, is it common for professors to supervise independent study courses with undergraduates over the summer?  4. How many people are generally in the class? Not that I mind large class sizes, necessarily - I\\'m just curious.  Also, I would appreciate any general advice/thoughts from current or former math majors at Michigan on how to get the most out of their time at the university.

I'll be a senior this fall and obviously applying to schools across the country. I think I have what it takes to be a part of the University - I have a good GPA and scored well on standardized tests. Originally from Michigan (I lived in Farmington Hills until I was 10), I'm a huge Wolverines fan. The business school and Law programs are top-notch on paper - but I want to hear it from you. Convince me; convince me to want to go to this prestigious school. I could go to CU-Boulder in my backyard - just a 40 minute drive away - but the lure of being a part of the Maize and Blue is too great for me not to explore it.

I was hoping to have a great 7th semester, but it's not looking good. Out of 9 classes, I'll probably end up with 2 B+'s and one B. The main issue I have with this is that it's worse than my last semester, where I had 2 B+'s for 8 classes. All of my classes are IB classes, so they're very difficult, but I know it my grades and GPA still aren't really good enough. I'm in-state, and my ACT is 34, but I know that Michigan values GPA above all else. How badly did I hurt my chances? <eos> \", \"<bos> This is for a Software Engineering role btw.

With that being said I don't want to make this just about me; hence, I put a title that is non specific to my situation.

When I visited last month, a handful of current students indicated that I should begin looking for housing right about now. I'm looking for an apartment, preferably near central campus (being within walking distance of the North Quad would be awesome), with a move-in date sometime in August. Unfortunately, none of the online listings I've found are for that far in the future, and I really don't want to be paying rent for months before I'm able to move. So, I'm hoping some of you might be able to give me a few pointers about how to best secure housing for the fall. In particular, I have a few questions: 1. Is it really the case that I should be looking this early? 2. Are online listing sites my best bet, or would I be better off using a realtor or trying to find something through word of mouth? 3. I need to find something that I'll able to afford on a modest stipend from the University.

In 1983, World News and Report based its findings entirely upon the perceptions of college deans. In 1988, World News and Report had begun using some stats, but it was still mostly perception-based.

I've heard a lot of things about how UMich calculates their GPA. For one, I know that they recalculate their GPA where every A+, A, and A- = 4. I also heard from some that they disregard Freshman year for all applicants, but for this I could not find a 100% confirmation. Does anybody know for sure or have an updated answer? I am asking because Michigan is my extremely high reach school and I am trying to assess my chances. If they consider Freshman year, my cumulative is 3.1. If they disregard my Freshman year, my GPA is 3.79 (lol yeah my Freshman year was literally THAT bad). My extracurriculars are great, I wrote very good essays, and my test scores are decent so GPA is my only concern. Anybody have an answer?

This is a one time project, but if the work goes well it will lead to ongoing work. Pay is commensurate based upon experience but I can tell you that I value good work and will pay well. My overall budget for the entire landing page is anywhere from 300 - 1000. Depends on how difficult the job is, but I would definitely be willing to pay for a difficult but amazing idea. We can discuss this.   It would be great if you also have an interest in business and marketing because I would love to hear your ideas about creating the best landing page for this product. The current landing page is a problem and does not make it easy for a new person to easily see the advantages of the product, or attract them to it within the first few seconds. If a user is not attracted, curious, or interested in the product in the first 10 seconds they usually move on. So the landing page needs to get straight to the point and attract the user to dig in more. You can view the app and current landing page here: [www.memrey.com]([url link]   Just message me if you are interested. Tell me about your experience and maybe send some sample work. If you have little experience I would still be open to working with you if you have a passion for design. I value simple, modern, beautiful designs.   Thanks!

How challenging is it, academically? I've taken some pretty boring/easy classes in high school, and I'm hoping to avoid those in college. I'm LSA, undecided major.  5. What's the living situation? Do most people live on or off campus?  6. Are the classes huge? I come from a small high school (200 kids) and I've had classes with as few as 3 people. I'm not expecting anything like that in college, but will every class be a 500 person lecture? 7. What's the intramural scene like? I played a lot of sports in high school, but wasn't good enough to play D1. Is there a strong intramural/club sports scene? Particularly soccer and lacrosse. 8. I haven't visited, but from what I read online the campus seems huge. How do you get around? Do people bring cars, or is it more walking? Do a lot of students have bikes? Are there buses?  9. How easy is it to double major or add a minor or something? I'm not sure I want to tie myself down to just one major.  10. How easy/hard is it to switch colleges?

So as the title says I was hoping someone who has lived in a similar arrangement (5+ people) could tell me a little bit about what it was like?  I've got a group of people who are all going to be attending the Ford School and we're looking at a 6 person house. I'm not excited about the prospect of living with 5 other people, as the house only comes with two bathrooms and a single kitchen. The rent is expected to be $583 per person, and its a short walk to the Ford School. I also have a dog, and with 5 people there it means someone is likely to be home at all times which is a good thing. However, I've been looking at other locations, and saw someone leasing a room for about $400 per month in an apartment about 10 minutes drive from the main campus, which doesn't seem to bad. This is for a 2 bedroom apartment. Is the ~$200 extra to live ON campus worthwhile? Are the parking passes expensive (haven't been able to locate a price for the year). And would being only 10 minutes away create difficulties driving to school if there is snow? Am I missing out on some sort of awesome experience by not being directly on campus?

About three days ago I signed a housing contract for Northwood V (two bedroom+study, shared, unfurnished, $617 per month). Turns out that was really bad timing, as the very next day a friend of mine, who is already at UMich, told me that he needs an off campus roommate. Apparently the housing people are pretty strict about not cancelling contracts (being a legally binding document and all, sheesh), but they told me it would be possible to reassign it, provided that I find someone willing to take it.

I have been trying to get my subjects for the Fall Term and since I am not from UMich I am not sure if the workload would be appropriate.

A little background:  I took eecs 183 last semester. I am enrolled in eecs 280, math 295 this fall. I also wanted to enroll in eecs 203 because not doing so would push back me taking eecs 281 another semester *to next fall*.  I am confident that I am ready for enrollment in eecs 203. I put in a permission request stating that but it was denied. I then decided to take a Math 115 class this upcoming summer half-term. But that comes with its own problem: 1. All the sublets I have seen till now have the move out date as August 18-19. I won't have a place to live for 10 days. As of now I see my only options as- 1. Taking 203 this winter, and then 280 the next fall.  2. Taking Math 115 this upcoming summer term, and live in a hotel or something for the next 10 days. Any advice is appreciated.

I know, why would I leave California haha) but it's not official yet so I don't think I can add that anywhere. * I have a good relationship with one of my math professors and could ask him to write an evaluation/recommendation if that would help.  **Reasons** * The main reason is to hopefully be accepted into the SUGS program for the Master's of Automotive Engineering. But even if I don't get into the SUGS program, I would still attempt to apply for the Master's after getting my BSE. * UofM has a better reputation than ASU.

I'm in Markley if that matters. <eos> \", '<bos> For those of you who have been there before,specifically the engineering career fair, is there a backpack check-in or place to put backpacks while talking to companies? Thanks! <eos> ', '<bos> If you have spare time and are looking to get extra cash, research studies pay pretty nicely for your time. Most are very simple and require minimal efforts. They are always looking for control subjects so you can apply to many of them.  **Edit**: Sorry about that! * [Here]([url link] is a link to UMClinical Studies. * [Here]( [url link] is the link to Business studies  <eos> ', '<bos> I am 19 and about to start my sophomore year at Oakland University, a school I chose to go to because of free tuition and room  board. The problem: I want to become an investment banker, an unfeasible goal coming from my university. I currently have a 3.8 overall GPA and completed 39 credits BEFORE my sophomore year. (with an upward trend in grades) notable classes: Macroecon (4.0), Calculus (4.0), Comp II (4.0) and my lowest grade: Microecon (3.5 first semester) I consistently volunteer as an IT consultant (over 100 hours and counting) at Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit (I extracted mass amounts of data from the food bank\\'s Outlook calendars and organized it into Excel spreadsheets along with other IT tasks) I currently work at my school\\'s Bloomberg Terminal computer lab and have a good understanding of its functions. I generally have a better understanding of finance than most students my age (i.e. DCF, EBITDA, and other comps). I also run a small car-customization service, tutor students, and mentor a student with Asperger\\'s syndrome. I know the Ross School of Business has a low acceptance rate even for students coming from Umich undergrad.  What can I do to enhance my application? What are my chances of making the cut? Can anyone give me tips/advice to improve? Any response would help. please hear me out; It is my dream to attend Ross and become an Investment Banker, and I\\'m not some kid who decided this after watching \"the Wolf of Wallstreet\"  <eos> ']\n"

Wondering if anyone is big into powerlifting and is willing to join or knows where anyone who is serious trains?     I would definitely look into a few of the gym's. They have a good variety of guys you might recognize. The only downside for the most part is if you're a guy who goes out on your own schedule, which might help you learn a few things for your next workout. Otherwise, it's hard to find a gym you like and keep yourself busy for most\n",

I'm usually not in the gym when he is but whenever I saw him he spent most of his time pacing back and forth and would occasionally put as much weight as possible on a machine and rep it out. The guy I'm thinking of has a beard, a ponytail and wears glasses. Every time he squats the entire gym stops what they're doing and watches haha.  \n"
