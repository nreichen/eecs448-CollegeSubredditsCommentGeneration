I am doing my math to estimate how much i will pay on top of rent but i am wondering how much everyone is paying for their electricity and gas. I used to live in upstate new york in a very poorly insulated house so in the winters it usually costs around $300 for heat and electricity.  Could you guys share how much u are paying for heat and electricity in east lansing? Especially in the winter time.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, I am looking to transfer to MSU for the fall 2016 semester. I have a question for people who are familiar with the transfer process. I have a 3.0 with roughly 40 credits at my current university. However, I have retaken a class or two and I wonder if that will impact my admissibility into MSU. I hear different things about how MSU calculates transfer GPA's. If they calculate all attempts, then this would put me under a 3.0, significantly harming my chances of being admitted. I also hear that MSU will look at both the GPA you have with retakes and the GPA you have after they recalculated it. So basically my question is, even though I have a 3.0, will retakes kill my chances? <eos> \n",

My idea is that if I decorate my room and it feels comfortable, it'll help me feel a little more at home. Plus I just want a cute room. I'm going to be in Snyder Phillips- what are some things that I should keep in mind while planning out decorations? What are some \"do\"s and \"don't\"s? All I have right now is a tiny mini humidifier shaped like a whale lol. Thank you! <eos> \n",

In 1998, when MSU banned alcohol at Munn, students rioted. Police had to bring out tear gas and riot teams to control students. But this transition seems to have gone smoothly.

For a while I've been toying with the idea of majoring in something more practical, i would love to study foreign relations at the James Madison college.

I don’t mind roommate matching but it would be cool to know someone a little before instead of just going in blind. So if anyone has room on their 4 bedroom lease and needs 1 or 2 more roommates, feel free to HMU and maybe we can live together in the fall!  <eos> \n",

I'm not sure whether my phone is going bonkers or the battery, so I'd really grateful if someone could lend me their battery to quickly test my phone. Or, if there's an electronics store, wherein I'd lend a battery to do the deed.  <eos> \n",

From past IM experiences, it's usually been a dick around time and I was wondering if this is the case at MSU IM Soccer. If so, are there any other places you could recommend to play competitive 11 vs 11 soccer? Thanks! <eos> \n",

I have heard of some people getting accepted and just taking requirements their first semester at MSU. Does anyone know if this is a thing or have any experience with it? On my application respond email there is a sidenote that says WRA 101 and College Algebra are \"strongly recommended\" but there is no indication that they are absolutely required. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Going into my third and final year at MSU (I'm a transfer student) and every year I've been here Financial Aid has been a huge hassle. Last school year they changed my aid a month before school started and I had to go back and forth with them all the way until the day before classes started so I'd be able to attend. Luckily last summer I got a good contact in the financial aid department who really helped me out. This summer I decided to start early and started emailing my contact back in May. I got my award notification and it was all Parent Plus loans (I pay for college all by myself, parents have never payed a cent) so I contacted my guy and he said he'd look into it. This was back in May, I've sent him two messages since then with no reply, but I had a friend stop by the office today to see if he still worked there and he does. Should I wait and see if he will reply or should I just try and tough it out through the on-phone support?  <eos> \n",

I did a search on here about McDonnel hall and found mixed opinions. I'm generally a pretty disciplined student, but I feel that I can get along with most people. I drink maybe 2-3 times a month. I'm half Chinese, and I can speak Mandarin, but I'd prefer to not be surrounded by the cliquey Asian internationals that I keep reading about. Is it all over for me, boyos? I'd appreciate any tips, as I'm not familiar with MSU or East Lansing. <eos> \n",

I thought it was at IM West but I was told it wasn't in their lost and found. Is there any other place, besides my hall's front desk, I can check for it? Also if by chance you found one in IM West, on an MSU lanyard, please let me know. I'm freaking out 'cause the 75 dollar charge can screw me if it's over something this stupid and this early. <eos> \n",

I plan on bringing a pretty decent sized flat screen. Anyone have any pictures they took of West Shaw's double rooms or any idea of what I could/couldn't bring/fit? Is space an issue?

            "<bos> Hey guys! I'm relocating and have some pretty peculiar housing needs. I don't know if many of you are familiar with Abbott place apartments but they were kind of my dream complex that fit my picky requisites pretty well.  So I go up to EL, do the tour fill out some paperwork and even interview for a position there all while waiting for my paycheck to snag one of at the time the 3 remaining 1 beds. Ring Them up within 48 hours later and they booked them all for other people. Which stunk out loud because they're still emailing me, and mailing me flyers after not holding an apartment for me (which I understand is policy it just blows chunks). They put me 1st on a wait list and said my chances are slim but really told me to essentially take matters into my own hands if it's that important to me.  In my undergrad apartment experience it was pretty common for folks to kinda hunt down potential lease breakers and get their units - all sorts of crazy tactics to get units. I came from a low supply high demand student apartment market. My question for y'all really pertains to the commonality of this approach up there. I know leases work different ways state to state and I even have a backup apartment all ready which will be okay, just far more expensive. I just want to make sure I've done everything in my power before giving up on Abbott place and signing a lease for somewhere else.  Any advice would be very appreciated. I'm just pretty confused relocating and looking for some local business tricks or advice for my situation. Or, though I doubt this would be the case - if you know anyone who's signed for a 1b at Abbott place for fall 2015 that doesn't want it or is on the fence Id be super willing to make an offer to take it off their hands!  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

First, are there any alternatives to park on campus if you're an off campus student besides the commuter lot? For example, a parking pass to another parking lot on campus.  Second, to anyone who goes to the gym regularly, how do you handle going and living off campus? I've gone to IM West the past two years and it's been nice because it's fairly close to my dorm. I feel like it'll be hard to go to IM West while living off campus.  Thanks! Hope it's been a great break for everyone.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> In 2010, two MSU basketball players raped a woman in the dorms. One of them admitted it. Their punishment: they had to move out of the dorms. MSU did nothing else about it. I learned about this story way before the Larry Nassar scandal emerged, the shame of MSU and MSUCOM. Apparently, the girls who waved an \"Expel rapists\" sign at an event got booed by over 10k people at the stadium and were escorted out by police. Lou Anna didn't do anything then. She defended inviting a rape apologist to speak at MSU years later, and she knew about Larry Nassar, as did Dean Strampel, a rapist himself, who \"stepped down\" only because of a stroke. Suffice it to say, I can't believe she had to be forced out. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So I was looking at the minimum requirements and saw that the 15” MacBook Pro was recommended. Also there might have been a typo because the form says “graphics table” potentially instead of graphics tablet? As an Media and Info major I have 2 questions. 1. Would you recommend the MacBook or have a different option that fit your tastes (I really don’t wanna fork over 2k for a laptop)? And do I need a graphics tablet or a graphics table? That last question was sorta a joke but the typo is really throwing me off  <eos> \n",

I transferred to MSU from comm. college with my econ, acc, mth, wra, and cse credits already done (got an A or B in each class).

I'm enrolled in CSE 231 in the fall, but for some reason schedule builder took a shit on me, and dropped my 232 class for the spring. Now, every single section is full. I thought about talking to my current advisors, but since they're not in the engineering department, I figured they would not be able to help.

I was upset I started off my academic career on the wrong foot and I wanted to right my wrongs. Everybody told me there was no chance I could 4.0 Calc 2 based on my Calc 1 grade. After a grueling semester and hours and hours of work, I was able to 4.0 the class. All I wanted to say is that if you put enough time and effort in a class and apply yourself, nothing can stop you. Also, having a good professor helps too! Cheers and good luck for the rest of your finals! <eos> \n",

Lately though, I've been contemplating switching my major to criminal justice. I intend to enter the law field but I know that's quite risky right now so I want something to fall back on.

Does that mean I can miss up to three classes and still get the full 20% for attendance?

I should mention that I am somewhat familiar with the campus (went to a few parties this past year as well as several games). My sister, a recent alumni, showed me around and told me about things like Rama, so I have an idea of where to drink haha. I am going to be a Junior transfer living in Cedar Village if that helps.

I did pretty well this summer and my GPA is going to go up pretty good, so I am considering applying for some after I get my grades back.

Doesn't matter if they are big or small. I just have never ever really tried to do it haha. Also, are engineering scholarships hard to get? <eos> \n",

I've heard many people say online math classes are a bad idea but I took an online math course outside of msu over the summer and I really enjoyed it. I liked how it was taught in video lectures because if I missed something, I could just replay it! I'm considering taking mth 124 online because of this reason. Let me know what you thought if you took any MSU online math classes in the past! <eos> \n",

I'm going to be majoring in computer science and was wondering what you guys would recommend learning before I get to MSU? I've been working through an introduction to algorithms books in my spare time and have been really enjoying it. I do have some programming experience and have a good base understanding in different areas of math. Is there certain topics that you would have wished you understood better before you started at MSU? Thanks in advance  <eos> \n",

The problem is the vast majority of my friends are seniors, so they'll all be graduating. My current room mates have all grown to hate each other, and my other friends are already booked. So I haven't figured shit out, and it's december. Am I fucked? What's a good way of finding like, 3 room mates who need a fourth? I could just live in the dorms.... I guess. Would it be weird for a senior to live in the dorms? Thanks. <eos> \n",

Idk why I'm being so anxious about this....it seems way to soon to accept a package, imagine how many people would be sending out packages? I'm just being afraid for no reason.

The other IAH classes for the semester are currently all full. I could just drop it, but that brings my credits pretty low. I might just do it anyway. I was hoping some of you guys could tell me about IAH's you took and how you liked them. Or what professors I should avoid/look for.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey guys, I'm posting this here to see if there are any magic players out there that want to come give FNM a shot at Liberty Coins. * Every Friday at 7 P.M. at Liberty Coins, 400 Frandor Ave. Next door to Trippers. * $5 entry * prizes based on participants, 1 pack taken home by each player minimum. * Small crowd of intelligent people, plenty of space. * Everyone is friendly. New player or have been playing for awhile, you're more than welcome to come. * Free parking (CATA also dumps you out literally right in front of the place) This past weekend you missed the Prerelease where the first place took home a box of Theros, 5 packs of Modern Masters, and that scaled downward. We had 2 events of that. Their store is a coins/gold/silver/collectibles, and they close at 6pm, but they are open for FNM. To get in, you just have to go through the automatic doors and Matt(the guy running it, who runs it without getting paid) will buzz you in, or someone will open the door for you. Please note, I'm not an employee or getting any sort of kick back at all, I'm just trying to drum up more people so we have a bigger group of people.  Here is their [Facebook]([url link] so you can ask questions or whatever directly to them. In addition, they have sealed product(booster boxes, fat packs, single packs), singles, sleeves and play mats, dice, and board games.  I'll also answer any questions that you have! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> After some thought, here is my response:  I don't particularly dislike football. I guess it boils down to the idea I dislike growth for the sake of growth without a plan. What is the purpose of a 'successful' athletic department if it comes at the same time as rising tuition costs. I see the purpose of a university as a place of higher education first. When our students accept the tuition hikes without protest (as is natural with any student I haven't been here forever, but I have yet to see anything substantial) while celebrating how great we are at sports it seems we implicitly accept this order of things. I don't.   Is my anger a bit misguided? Perhaps. But what if students stopped showing up at sporting events in protest of tuition hikes? What if we took a stand and said no new luxury add-ons until we address the systematic problems with higher education? I understand sports are extremely popular. To me, that is how students might be able to actually change something, by letting the university know we don't care if our football team is good if actually attending this university cripples us in debt.  I don't want to project blind anger, which I assuredly did in this post. I just wish there was a broader discussion within the student population about the direction of our university and what the plan is long-term to make this a place students can learn without fear of life-long debt.    <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi all, I'm hoping to transfer for Fall 2017 into MSU from a CC in Michigan. I struggled a bit this semester, as I took the previous Fall semester off to focus on work and making money, and had a hard time adjusting back to school life. This Spring semester I took 14 credits and this summer I will be taking another 15, altogether reaching/passing MSU's transfer requirement of 28 credits. They have only asked for spring grades on my decision letter, so I would appreciate someone to honestly chance my application: MTH 116 (4cr): C+ (2.3) | WRA 100 (3cr): A- (3.7) | HIS 1510 (4cr): A (4.0) | PSY 101 (3cr): B (3.0) |  MTH 116 is the last math course needed to transfer to MSU and that is the main source of my worry. Altogether, I meet their requirements for transfer by the time Fall 2017 starts, but I'm somewhat worried what decision might come Mid-May. Any opinions appreciated.

            "<bos> Hi guys. I have a question regarding housing contract cancellations for on-campus living if anyone has any experience.  Background information: I am an international student, and will be a junior this coming fall semester. I signed up to live on campus at Williams hall about a month ago, so I'm past the 14 day cancellation period.  Due to developments in my personal life, it is becoming apparent that living on will not be desirable nor practical.  Now, considering the billing process hasn't even begun yet, does anyone know how to possibly cancel the contract without any losses? I understand that they do offer a \"buyout\" option, but as far as I could gather they bill you 60% of the price of the dorm for the full year, which seems unreasonable considering the fact that the billing process hasn't even begun and neither has the semester.  I'd love to hear some opinions, thanks in advance guys. <eos> \n",

They haven't finished grading my 2nd quarter work yet which is partially why I haven't applied yet. I'm not exactly sure how much senior work is necessary to send on a transcript. My highest act score was 23, and my parents insisted that I take it again in Feb. What are your thoughts? Should I apply now? Is it too late :(?

I found a job posting for a Facilities Building Worker, and I'm wondering if anybody has had the job before or knows someone who has had it.

Since I'm coming in as a junior I want to know how my schedule will work with all of the 1-2 credit classes that most students take their freshmen and sophomore year. ie) EGR100, EGR102, CE273, and CE274. Are they going to load me up and require me to take all of these classes along with others like ME222? Even if I take all five of these it won't even make me a full time student since its only 10 credits, and would it be normal if they make me take like 7 classes at once?

            "<bos> Hey r/msu! Myself and three friends from Purdue are trying to get tickets to the Purdue vs. MSU game on October 19th. What I've found on Stubhub is a little above our price range. Here at Purdue, it's pretty easy to get a non-student through the gates with a student ticket; is that the case at MSU or would you recommend having a regular ticket. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Incoming freshman here, I use two 24\" monitors on my pc and usually just have them on the default stands next to eachother since my desk at home is big enough. However, I noticed when I visited for AOP, the desks in the Case Hall suites weren't quite big enough to fit two monitors so I'd have to get a monitor mount to be able to fit both on my deskspace. However, I wasn't paying attention to the actual design of the desks while I was there and I don't know if a monitor mount like this one: [url link] would work as I'm not sure if there's a protruding lip for it to clamp to. Is there anyone who's spent a little too much time inspecting their desk that can help me out? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hi all, I'm a student currently attending OCC this spring semester and hope to transfer for the fall semester at MSU. I am a freshman this year and will only have 14 transferable credits by the end of the semester, meaning I will have to send in high school transcripts. I had a rough time in high school but am doing much better in college. If all goes steady, I will have a good GPA at the end of the semester. If anyone with decent knowledge on the transfer process could chance me based on the following that would be great: 2.8 HS GPA 22 ACT - 3.4 College GPA w/ 14 out of the 28 recommended credits to transfer without HS transcripts. If I'm not able to transfer for the fall, I am taking summer classes which will bring me up to 29 college credits in total which I would then be able to apply for the spring semester instead without HS information. If anyone could chance me and maybe give me some pointers based on my situation please let me know. Any responses are appreciated. Thanks, and Go Green! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Anyone else feel like they have absolutely no sparkle dust of an idea of what they want to achieve in life?  Everyone always says, \"Do what makes you happy,\" ok fine, but I genuinely feel like I would stay at the same level of happiness (not fully happy, always searching for something \"more,\" but surprise there is no \"more!\") doing anything.  I'm a super senior so anyone with the \"Just wait, you have time, it will come to you\" advice can politely keep that thought to themselves, it will just depress me more.  Anyway, just wondering if there are others like me. Tell me your story. <eos> \n",

I went to a local store yesterday to get a few groceries, but they were pretty expensive... compared to Walmart, anyway.

            "<bos> Hey, so I am looking to room with one of my good friends next year in a dorm(both sophomores). And I have a question about the drug policy for MSU.  He wants to have weed on him in the dorm, I don't really care. I don't smoke but at the same time I just could care less about those who do. I am wondering if him having weed(a few ounces at times) in the room makes me in any way liable?. He has a med card if that means anything. I looked through MSU drug policies but couldn't find anything pertaining to this. Anyone have any idea? If possible could you link me a citation, just so I/he know(s) for sure? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello all, I was wondering if there was anyone that could give me some advice on cheap housing around MSU for the 2016/2017 school year. I'm not too aware of the different apartments so if anyone has any opinions on any or has heard things about any apartments, your input would be greatly appreciated. Right now my number one concern is price as I am trying to live as cheap as possible. My next concern would be the noise level as I plan to be very busy next year and I will need my sleep. So far the cheapest places I have found are Valley [Forge Apartments]([url link] and [Walden Woods Apartments]([url link] Their rents go from $357-$388 and $365-$418 respectively for a 2 room 1 bath apartment for 2 people. I'm not sure if utilities are included or not but I would assume not. These apartments are both operated by dtn which I've seen a lot of hate for although I'm not too sure how well founded that hate is. If anyone knows anything about these places or better places, please let me know! I've also seen posts about the student co-ops but I don't know much about those either. I looked on their website a little but I couldn't find a price range mentioned anywhere. If that is a cheaper option, however, I would be interested in learning more about it. Thanks for any and all input. tldr; cheapest place to live for an MSU undergrad student. <eos> \n",

I'm looking to start a club that can bring as many fighting game players together to create a MSU fighting game community. At this stage I'm looking to see if there is a real interest, the club would meet sometime during the week and consoles and games would be brought so that everyone could play together, the only thing required is that club members would have to bring their own controllers. If you have any interest please either message me or reply! Thank you for your time! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey /r/MSU, does anyone have experience with canceling a housing contract *after* their appeals have failed? The iLiveOn team told me that I'd have to pay the cancellation fee, but every indication I've looked into seems to show that people have gotten out without issue without having to do that -- more importantly, I really don't have the money to do it, so I'm stuck between a wall and a hard place. Any advice or anecdotes? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Does anyone have any experience using the Fox to go apps for watching live sports?  Typically I use ESPN and BTN2GO for games when I am not at my house but this one will be through Fox, which sucks anyways to be honest.  We will be at a family Christmas party that will be flooded with MSU fans wanting to watch the game. Only issue is the hosts do not have HD... And nobody wants to watch the game on a 55'' TV and have it be shitty standard.  I have no issues with streaming it via their WiFi or my data but I want to make sure this can happen.  Not looking for some illegal stream that isn't consistent. Trying to find out what f Fox Now for Fox sports go will have it available.  Thanks in advance  <eos> \n",

I'd be looking to add a different ISS course and then get refunded/pay for the new one, but I'm unfamiliar with what the process would entail as this is my first semester.

However, you can't officially sell student tickets to out of school students. We've done it before where we just borrowed someone's id, but with the newest changes, were not sure if that would work.  Does anyone know how closely they'll look at a borrowed id? Or will I have to get one that looks like him? I'd need to find the idea of someone who looks indian/middle eastern.  Thanks!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I currently go to Oakland Community College, by the end of this year I'll have 28 credits, only 24 of them are transferable thanks to my idiot counselor. But anyways I'll have 24 credits and I'm guessing around a 3.7 GPA, my coursework is intense. I understand that if I don't have 28 transferable credits I'll need to send my ACT and High School GPA which is shambolic. My High School GPA was like a 2.3 and I got a 21 on the ACT. I'm thinking about retaking the ACT which I know for sure I'll do better on now. Mostly I did bad because I was an idiot lazy teen but also a little bit because I have ADD and only began to start treating it starting college. Thank you in advanced! <eos> \n",

Looking dead tired because it was after work I took a quick selfie and sent it in. Two weeks later roll by and damn do I look ugly af in this picture. I must have been really tired at the moment and didn't realize how bad the pic was. So just curious, can I get a new picture of me on there? Or perhaps next semester or next year? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> As an incoming freshman, I have a question about how I should go about paying my bills. I have a MESP (MIsaves) account, and i'm wondering if I should pay the total cost of my first semester (\\~$12k), or just the minimum payment due (\\~$5k). I realize I need to pay the total cost eventually (obviously), but I was wondering if there were specific consequences for people who either pay all at once versus those who pay the minimum. If I were to pay anything at all, it would be under a mailed check. So, would there be a processing fee for paying once / double fee for paying twice? Also, there is a line-item in my mailing bill that mentions the total payment (\\~$12k) voiding a \"**To Avoid Pmt Plan**.\" I'm assuming that if you don't pay the total cost, you will be put on some sort of payment plan to make you pay the rest of the cost. Any help from those in the know would be appreciated. Go Green! <eos> \n",

Can someone lay everything out to me, in terms of the application, of how to be successful? I have my Case Study soon and I’m concerned I won’t do well. What should I be looking out for? How should I approach it? What can I expect? I do pretty well on essays generally in all my classes. Is that any indicator of how well I’ll do? The Case Study and Experiential Profile both have me concerned. Anyone have some tips? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I went to submit a new print job on WebPrint but the locations were very limited and general. For example, the location category for some of them just say \"East Lansing Campus.\" So I tried to see if I could just print from a lab (Specifically Case or Wilson) since I didn't know any of those WebPrint options. But when I got to the page that gives info on rhe computer labs and lounges where printers are located, it says I can use WebPrint in order to send print jobs to any MSU printers. Why don't I see any of those location options on WebPrint? Also, if I were to just go to the Case Lounge for example, could I just connect my laptop to the printer in there and print and just bypass the whole WebPrint thing? Would they have the USB cable necessary there already? Would it link to the print.msu.edu account where I already bought print credits so I can use those? Thanks for the help! <eos> \n",

It launches with ESPN 1/2, which is great, but we'll obviously be missing a lot of games relevant to our interest without the Big Ten Network. There is going to be a sports tier that can be added on, but no work on Big Ten Network (if I had to guess, I'd say it won't be there right now). Anyone want to see if we can start a grassroots campaign on Twitter to get the Big Ten Network's attention? Use #B1GonSling to see if we can get their attention.

The biggest reason I wanted to do this is because of studying abroad.  JC has a 2 year program for my degree (mathematics) that transfers to a 4 year university to finish the degree. My question is this- if I were to spend my first two years at a CC before transferring, would I still be able to study abroad? Does anyone have any experience with this?

            "<bos> Afternoon fellow spartans, I finished my freshman AOP and registered for classes yesterday and I wanted to take ECE 201 and CSE 231 in the fall, however my advisor told me that CSE 231 is a prereq for ECE 201 and advised me against taking them concurrently but I decided to go with it. Is there any problem with this? I'm only going to have 13 credits in the fall so I'm not going to be bogged down too bad by other course work. My other classes are EGR 100 (3) and MTH 234 (4) <eos> \n",

From what I've heard, this is most likely your room but some are subject to change between now and when we get the official \"this is your room/roommate\" email. I was really happy with where I was placed (Campbell) but two other guys posted online that they have the same room number as me which means I'd be a 3rd wheel transitional roommate.  My questions are: * Will I likely get my room changed or stay in the same one before the official email? * If I get switched will I still be in Campbell/West Circle? What about after being moved out of transitional? (should that be the case) * Is there any way I can influence this? Thanks for any help or thoughts. <eos> \n",

I have been admitted into Computer Science but my technical GPA just barely made it, skidded by with a 3.0 technical where 2.9 was required for admission. Now that I am admitted, what happens if my technical GPA slips below 2.9? Will I be kicked out of the school of engineering? Will I be placed on probation for a semester? I am always trying to do my best, but I just have been anxious about this possibility this semester because of how hard my classes have been (all three 3XX classes at once...)

I was wondering if someone would be willing to assist in my interpretation of the resume section in the online application: \"Resume: If more than one semester has elapsed between your last semester of enrollment in high school/college and your anticipated start date at MSU, please list the activities (e.g. employment, military service, travel) that you participated in during this time. List the most recent activity first. To indicate that you are currently employed by someone, please enter a Start Date and leave the End Date blank.\" My question is: is this only asking for the jobs/activities between graduation from undergrad and potential start date at MSU or asking for those activities and further back? I think it's the the former but I just wanted a second opinion! Thanks! <eos> \n",

Anyways, my loans this year go up to $16,000. This is SO much money. Is it too much? Should I just not go? My parents aren't doing parent plus so I have to go through Sallie Mae. I had to beg them to cosign and that still resulted in an argument. I love MSU, but this is killing me. <eos> \n",

My only problem is the donation clinic isn't very accessible from campus without a car.

            "<bos> Hello! So recently, I have been messing around with the idea of triple majoring in Criminal Justice, Psychology, and Social Work. I want to know how bad/good of an idea it is, as a lot of the courses overlap or can be used as electives. I want to be a Criminal Psychologist once I graduate but also find the idea of having a private group practice in a social work setting where I will be able to give counseling to those affected by the CJ system (incarcerated family, sexual assault, domestic violence, etc.). I feel as if these majors go very well together, but would like the a few opinions from others as my advisor has not been very helpful thus far and so want to know if what I am doing is even worth it (as I currently am a freshman and am not very educated on the topic). I know that I will likely not graduate in four years, and that is okay with me. I’m just really looking for opinions/advice. Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I can add classes, but when I click “enroll” it says I don’t meet the course requirements. Even if the course has *no pre-reqs* or I know I meet them.  EDIT: I think I figured out what’s wrong. Even if you’ve met the pre-requisites for courses, the site is currently unable to recognize that. Because if you click the course description to check on pre-reqs, it takes you to an error 404. So I think whatever it does to check on your pre-reqs is broken.  <eos> \n",

I'm starting to feel like it's not the right fit for me, and MSU's Media  Information degree looks really cool, so I was looking at transferring in Fall 2017. Can anybody speak to the quality of it?

I was hoping to sell this bike (in nice condition, for cash) and I was wondering if a situation like this has happened before. How does the local MSU community sell/buy used stuff?

I've got a friend and we've both been accepted, so if we both end up at MSU were thinking rooming together would be a good idea. Now the thing is, while he's set on going to MSU, I'm not sure yet. MSU is my #2 school, so I've gotta wait and see about financial aid for my #1 before I make a decision. Are dorms assigned on a first come first serve basis? Am I screwing us both over by not making my decision now, so we need to wait to apply for housing? How exactly does it all work. Thanks! <eos> \n",

But I am posting this to say I LOVE TOM IZZO. He is one of the classiest guys in all of sports, collegiate or professional. He is loyal to your program despite getting offers from NBA teams each year, his teams are clean, his recruiting is clean, and he is a stand up guy. I have always felt this way, but [this reaction]([url link] to Bruce Weber's firing sealed the deal for me. Izzo is a man, standing up for what he believes in, not afraid to call people out. And this is all in the middle of a championship run. I suppose the point of this post, and me wandering over to this unfamiliar territory, to to remind you to appreciate that you have one of the best coaches in all of sports. Enjoy that.

I think it'd be pretty cool to put together a a group of focused friends who can have good discussions, study, and keep each other motivated, plus I'll probably need the occasional asistance with math. I have a desktop which I could do some gaming on when I'm not busy, and am fitness geek, personally subscribing to Socrates quote about physical fitness. I like being well rounded in most subjects, and in particular love theology, politics, and science and think it'd be even cooler to find someone more educated or just as knowledgeable so that we can learn from one another. And before I forget, if your going to be involved in any sciences, I could use a CRISPR buddy as throughout my time here I want to get well acquainted with the technology and methods. Being a lover of plants and botany I'll probably make some attempts at glow in the dark chimera plants of sorts \\(and fail/create a abomination\\). That's about it, thanks for reading. Hope I didn't post this in the wrong place. But I really look forward to the rest of the year with you guys! :\\-\\) <eos> \n",

I am currently about to enter my second year at Oakland university. I tried to get into MSU both after high school and after my first year of college. didn't get accepted either times. Because OU has no Game Design program I currently am in my second choice for a career Secondary Education History with a Social Studies Endorsement. I have heard form someone that apparently the program is not very good. Some girl told me she went to MSU for the gaming program and she hated it so she is transferring elsewhere (I believe to the art building at Ferris State). Any truth in the matter that it is bad? Any info would be appreciated especially first hand experiences. Thanks! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Like [this]([url link] I'm trying to gauge interest in this club as it's an ongoing passion project of mine (and to be honest, I'd like to put this club on my resume). I think the ultimate goal is to recreate this video: [url link] So obviously it would work best if people could make their own long pants that they've dyed with glow-in-the-dark ink. Expose it to a light for like an hour and then take it outside at night and it'll really stand out. Of course we'd also need some ground rules. Currently I'm thinking bring your own long pants (don't expect to borrow) no talking once the group gathers. I'm debating if hushed whispers should be allowed but maybe that's something the group can decide walk slowly, no one wants to see these things run just have fun with it! I guess another thing is that the schedule for this club will probably be sporadic. The meetings will start likely between 10:30PM - 3:00AM, and usually last like 30 min. Dates will probably be every 9-20 days. We will meet right by the Union and walk to Grand River from there Let me know if you'd be interested in doing this, DM me and I can add you to the Slack group! I'd love to see this club finally take off. <eos> \n",

Now I've smoked my fair share of trees but I'm clean now, but my friends want to celebrate before I move away. So my question is for anybody that's worked at TSN before, do they administer a drug test before starting the job? If so which method do they use?  Edit: there's a lot of mixed views here but I'm thinking I might press my luck. Do you guys know anything about 89FM's policy? <eos> \n",

Looks like allmsu re-directs you to Koofers, which appears to suck for selling. You can kinda sell books through allmsu still, in a round-about way, through Classifieds, Course Materials, Other, but I'm not sure if people actually do that. Please advise! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I know I'm not going to get above a 2.0 GPA in one of my classes this semester and I am planning on retaking it in the summer. But the schedule builder isn't letting me sign up because I'm still currently taking the class. I don't want to drop the class because I told my parents I'm going to take a similar class in the summer, but I need to enroll soon to reserve my spot. Is dropping the only way I can enroll in the same class for the summer or is there another way? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I just applied to MSU for the fall 2017 semester. I have already been accepted to Oakland University and University of Michigan Dearborn. I would like to get into MSU, but I have not always been a great student, and have kept a consistent 3.0-3.2 GPA throughout high school. Sophomore year I took an AP class, and Junior and senior year I took/am taking three APs.  I got a 25 on my ACT and a 1190 on my SAT. I did three years of JV cross country and over 75 community service hours in a summer program for kindergarten kids.  I feel like I wrote a pretty good personal statement and talked about learning about work ethic and other people's lives from a high school job at a grocery store. I really nailed down the 'work ethic from the job will transfer to the classroom' thing.  But, I am worried I may not get in from my low GPA. anyone here with similar experiences?  <eos> \n",

I've noticed it has around 35-36k undergrads, and that is a lot. Can any current or former students comment on this? Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of people?

My idea is to create a late night waffle restaurant for downtown East Lansing. Think Coldstone Creamery, but waffles instead of ice cream. I have a more lengthy description and a possible menu on wordpress ( [url link] ). Is this a dumb idea? Would you consider going here instead of Conrad's or Menna's? If you guys could let me know what you think (good or bad) I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks! <eos> \n",

I have a hybrid section of WRA 101 next semester and IAH 207 (Michigan: The Life and Times of Where you Are) in the spring. I'll read it if I have to, but I am just an insanely slow reader.

            "<bos> Hi everyone! Potential MSU freshman here - in my state both flagship schools (University of Texas and Texas AM) are about 95--99% Texan. The result is that a lot of students from the same high school end up at the same college. It's fairly common for students from my high school (that go to these schools) go just hang out with their high school friends or friends they've already made in other high schools in my city. Coming from out of state, would this be an issue for me? Would I feel like the \"new kid\" as a lot of students would know eachother? (Sorry if this is a stupid question) - if it makes a difference I got accepted into the Honors College which I would assume would be a tighter community Thanks!  <eos> \n",

I'm really looking to get a job, hopefully paid but I'd do volunteer, in one of the labs assisting with research of some sort.

Things I should know and say going in? Any help would be greatly appreciated! <eos> \n",

In high school, when I did my stats and calc classes, I was allowed to use an N-Spire, and so that's the calculator that I'm most familiar with. My question is, for the classes I'll be taking, is that worth using there, or are N-Spires, or graphing calculators in general not used on tests and quizzes? If so, what calculator would you recommend getting? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I applied to MSU and found out today that I was rejected. I think I might have made a mistake while applying though. A quick summary of my educational background: Homeschooled, 24 on my ACT, and two community college courses. I graduated highschool in 2015, I pretty much took a year off and did two online community college courses in that time. I applied for fall semester of 2016 at MSU this past January. I thought I applied as a freshman and not a college transfer. They gave me a decision letter they gave me when they told me I was not accepted. In that letter they mention that I don't have enough college credits to transfer to MSU. So I guess I'm wondering if I reapply and not list my community college work, do you think that'll make a difference? Or is it too late at this point? <eos> \n",

I'm more into the brotherhood, philanthropy, and networking aspect as I'm not a huge partier or drinker. I really value connecting with people and I hate the typical \"douchey frat\" culture.

My PHY 183 class is Monday, and I've personally struggled incredibly hard with this class for whatever reason and am really trying to cram right now. I ran the numbers and I need to get a 60% at lowest. How are the finals usually? I have professor Iwasaki, I've heard rumor they grade the exam out of 20? Should I just go over the answers and explanations to the online homework? They posted a practice finals but it's useless as it only has an answer key with the letter out of the 8 choices as if that helps somebody who doesn't understand how to tackle the question. Really appreciate you guys help, pretty nervous for this and just curious how tough this final is and if you think someone who sort-of struggled with the class can get a 60% and tips of word of advice. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> As the title says, I suck and I failed a bunch of classes because I realized I hated my major during my 4th year. So I only have 4 more classes that are required but I need 14 more credits, apart from my required classes, throughout my 5th year to graduate. What are some really easy 2-4 credit electives I could take to fill that void? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> As I sit on my couch with finals week coming to a close, 3 am on the clock, and a huge unfinished project due in 7 hours.....I just want to express how awesome it is to have this subreddit on my feed. As I scroll through useless pictures and memes on the front page, feeling as though i'm wasting my life away, it always cheers me up to see such familiarity pop out at me every page or so. Whether it be about parking tickets, an a cappella show, the lovely princess lacey, or even the conversations about a tough sports loss, I know I can always count on feeling at home in this ever expanding website. So, from a fellow spartan, I hope your finals week hasn't been too stressful and thank you for always being here. GO GREEN! <eos> \n",

I'm coming from the muggy summer heat of New Orleans, so first how's the weather as in what to pack? 2. What is the booze situation? Here we have beer and liquor stores in every convenience and grocery store. Is there anywhere to buy package liquor on campus or do I need to have my Uber driver make a pit stop? 3. What are your favorite restaurants and bars? I'm not limited budget-wise like the days of undergrad. Thanks so much! <eos> \n",

Will most likely get a pass no matter the cost difference, but still would like to know. Thanks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So during the Engineering Career Gallery last Wednesday, down on the court floor, a guy that I was standing next to introduced himself and told me that he was here for Hitachi consulting, but he also ran a side business, and he was looking for students with entrepreneurial spirit. He said that there is going to be a conference this Tuesday in Southfield for motivated students, and I gave him my resume. Today, he called me and asked if I wanted to go to this conference, and I said that I didn't have transportation. He then offered to give me a ride and I texted him my campus address. Does this sound sketchy? <eos> \n",

I was about to sign the apartment lease today but I check LiveOn and it says I'm still signed up for a door and have been assigned a roommate?

Any piece of knowledge would be awesome, thanks. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> MSU recently sent out a rough list of things that I should bring onto campus on the very first day. However, I noticed that the missed a few things that I originally had in mind, such as a printer. In the case of a printer, is it really necessary? I heard that they set a limit on how many pages you can print and having your own printer is a lot more convenient because you can print however you want and you don't have to wait for any queues or lines. Besides a printer, what other \"necessary\" things should I bring but may not be included in their \"Things to Bring\" list. EDIT: Thank you to everyone who replied to this post. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm incoming freshman this fall and I'm still debating on a major to choose. After viewing all the majors offered, I have a few choices picked out and was wondering how the Media and Information major was, particularly with a concentration in Film and Media Production. I have no experience in this field, so I'm wondering if that could be an issue, or if this major is even worth the time and money. I'd love to hear from anyone who has this major or has knowledge of the major. Thanks for your help! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Haven’t been able to get my moped started since the beginning of the spring semester. Would’ve addressed sooner, however didn’t plan to use again until now. Think it may be an electrical issue.  TaoTao 50cc (Spare me the “shouldn’t buy a cheap scooter” comments lol) Symptoms and such: - One day, after having ridden for majority of fall semester, did not receive any response from scooter when turning the key and pressing starter. - When inserting and turning key, the gas and other gauges do not move, nor do lights come on as they normally would.  - No response/turnover whatsoever from my electric starter. Kick start never really worked, maybe because I only ever used the electric start, idk. - Have taken out battery, charged, and tested. This does not seem to be the issue. - Haven’t tested spark plug, although if that was the issue, I feel like the gauges and lights would activate upon turning the key. - Have always remembered to hold break while attempting to start, moped is “on”  Thanks  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm going into my senior year of high school with a 3.4 gpa, and an 1110 on the (new) SAT. I'm signed up to take the SAT again (October 1st), and my first ACT (September 10th). I'm not in any honors classes besides music, but I'm actively working to get AP Environmental Science into my schedule for the next school year. Extracurriculars that I can remember off the top of my head: Wind Ensemble (honors band), Honors Jazz Ensemble, Marching Band, Marching Band Trombone Section Leader, NYSSMA All-State Music Festival 97/100, Treasurer of Music Technology Clubñ Theatre Club, Tri-M Music Honor Society Inductee, If you couldn't tell, I'm a musician. I plan on majoring in whatever the fisheries/wildlife major is at MSU (forgot the name of it). I've wanted to be a music teacher for a while, but I've changed my mind as of about a month ago. I plan on joining my school's environmental club, and also plan on taking animal science and ecology courses in the next school year. I intend on continuing my musical career in MSU, primarily through the Spartan Marching Band. Do you guys think I can get into MSU with my current grades? I'm planning on studying much more within the time that I have left as a high school student; whether it be for school or the SAT/ACT. I'm just wondering if my current grades could possibly get me in (mainly as stress relief). EDIT: Had to change stuff since I'm bad at reddit formatting <eos> \n",

I am, however, an idiot that spilled milk all over her carpet and, due to the potential smell, need to vacuum that shit asap. Is there a place nearby where I can rent or borrow a vacuum?

I have met with the STT department and advisors, they all refuse to give me an override. Due to the fact that I would be graduating early, and it's not entirely necessary in their eyes. But for me, it would mean not taking out loans for another semester. Please PM me if you are in this class, perhaps we can work out a deal? I have been sitting on Schedule Builder for the past week and it's completely full. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Penn Stater here. I just want to offer my total support to MSU fans, those who had zero knowledge of what may or may not have been happening, and are equal parts outraged and depressed. I've always known MSU fans to be a solid group, and always enjoyed when they came to State College. For those alums and fans, you're in for a lousy year (for that portion of yourself), and you're going to find yourself questioning your commitment to MSU, the teams, the kids. As a secondary, uninvolved party, it can really wear on you. I'll say I was equally outraged and depressed at the Sandusky thing. You'll find that tailgates and games don't feel the same, they don't have that same happiness, emotion. I went a couple years just feeling dead and going through the motions at games. You're going to wear as much as a Sparty logo and have people say horrible stuff. It happened to me when I was traveling and had a tiny logo on a shirt months after. Usually drive-by, vicious stuff, and not from who you expect.  The news may or may not come out in waves. When you think it's done, it's probably not.  In the pile-on phase, there were the \"burn the stadium, salt the earth\" comments... in PSU case, we had the threat of being DECERTIFIED as a University, academically. There will be a lot of virtue signaling, and it will be a competition for who can feel more holy. Ignore it. 99.9999% of the University never knew of anything. There is going to be a tremendous amount of finger pointing and vicious gloating. DO NOT READ COMMENTS ON BLEACHER REPORT OR DEADSPIN OR WHATEVER. They will never be constructive or useful, ever. Don't bother posting there, ever, you're just feeding trolls. PLEASE PLEASE separate the good fans, the great people, and a wonderful institution from the acts of one or a very small handful of people. Michigan State is a wonderful institution, I don't need to tell you all that. Take time to get away from it, get outside, set it aside. It can seriously consume you and your time. Hang in there, represent all the good of MSU, that's all you can do. Hail Sparty, and I wish you guys the best.   <eos> \n",

Any ideas as to when I'll hear back about a decision?  I was just offered a spot in the MA program at my undergrad and have 15 days to accept. MSU is my first choice so if anyone has any experience in grad school at MSU in regards to decision letters, insight would be very appreciated!  I'm mostly interested in dates for the school of social sciences but any grad students are welcome to chime in on when they received their decision letter.  Thanks guys!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm currently building my schedule for my senior year, which will have 6 4xx level CSE courses in it. Looking through the offered course list, a lot of them grab my attention. I'm curious, which course was actually useful/interesting/not 100% theoretical? Some of the courses that caught my attention were:  * CSE 410 Operating Systems * CSE 435 Software Engineering * CSE 476 Mobile App Development * CSE 472 Computer Graphics * CSE 477 Web App Architecture  Development  I was also interested in CSE 425 (Intro to Computer Security), but it has a prereq of 422 (Computer Networks) as well. Are both of these courses useful? Lastly, will taking 4 CSE courses/semester kill me? I have 335 and 498 as a requirement, so it adds to 4 CSE courses / semester.  Thanks a bunch and Go Green! <eos> \n",

This summer I've been getting pretty into triathlons and climbing, and while on msu's campus I seriously doubt it will be hard to find beautiful running routes, I've been looking for some off-road trail biking. Also I've heard that lower peninsula climbing is really sparce except for a crag called grand ledge, anyone up to make a trip next year if that's what you're into? Aside from that, I'm really interested in any cool stuff that the standard orientation and tours don't really cover. Thanks! <eos> \n",

We've found a house that we really like, but the rent overlaps with our current apartment lease by 3 months over the summer. What I'm trying to get a feel for is how easy it is to find someone to sub lease, because that could make or break us being able to live in this house that we really like. Our apartment is in Cedar Village and the rent is very cheap ($380). <eos> \n",

I'm a social person who wants to go partying and stuff, but at the same time know I should focus on school(majoring in CSE). Does the dorm you get into really matter in terms of how social people are? Got any other freshman advice? I'm all ears!  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So this is something I heard awhile ago but I can't find any info on it, does it matter how many credits I've taken at MSU if I want to transfer a summer course? I've heard that once you hit junior standing you can no longer transfer outside credits, is this true or can I continue to take summer courses at a different university and transfer them back?  <eos> \n",

Are lectures posted online for repeated viewing or do I have to be present live for them. I have the same question about hw. Are problem sets just posted on one day and due another or is there more structure? I haven't been able to find this information anywhere on the schedule builder or other places. Any help would be greatly appreciated because I'm planning a trip to Colorado that will overlap partially with this course. I'll have Wi-Fi there (via dairy Queen and local libraries) but I just need specifics before I can rest easy. Thanks for reading! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey Spartans, I've started searching for the right college and I just toured MSU yesterday and was overall impressed by what I saw. One thing the tour guide said that surprised me was \"MSU is the #1 astrophysics school in the US\" (Astrophysics is what I want to study). Prior to my visit, I did some research on the internet to find which schools had the best astrophysics programs, and a particular list UM ranked above MSU (~20 to ~40 in the nation). Notably, MSU was far from #1. [Here's the list I'm referring to.]([url link] I talked to the tour guide personally after the tour and she said that MSU was #1 because undergrads had numerous opportunities to participate in graduate-level research. From what I have seen, it seems that UM has [very similar opportunities.]([url link] I was hoping to learn the opinions of some of MSU's astrophysics students. I thought that perhaps the tour guide said this as an attempt to further \"sell\" the university to us in the group (I wasn't the only prospective student there that was interested in astrophysics) or if the websites that I have found this list on is less than reputable or doesn't take everything into account.  Thank you <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I'm moving into an apartment in the 144 Highland Apartment Building next year. I was wondering if anyone knew about what options are available for an internet provider. I know that the DTN people I've spoken with have all mentioned Comcast, but given their reputation, I'd rather go with someone else if possible. I saw a post on here from a while back that mentioned GoLightSpeed fiber, and it appears that 144 Highland is within their service range. However, according to GoLightSpeed's FAQ I would have to get an installation cleared with DTN, since they may have some sort of exclusivity agreement. Does anyone here have experience with DTN on that issue? Do they allow other ISPs, or just Comcast? I'd also love to hear if anyone knows of any other alternatives I could look into. Edit: Added a bit more information.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I applied for Broad this fall like many others. In terms of the experiential profile and case study, I believe I did pretty well; however, my grades are what scares me more. At the end of Fall I believe I will have a 3.195 or 3.2-ish. This is due to my utter incompetence in economics. I got a 2.5 in EC-202 and EC-201 I feel as though I’ll do the same (I’m shooting for a 3.0). As for my pre-core GPA, I haven’t got my CSE-101 grade yet, but it’s likely 3.0, and my Calc grade is 4.0. My overall pre-core is then 3.5 (I took WRA at a community college). I’m worried that my Econ grades are really going to hamper me. They’re my only below 3.0 grades, and my GPA is less than stellar.  Is anyone able to give me an idea of my chances based on their experience? Any help would be great.  <eos> \n",

I'm wondering if I should send my transcript from this semester right now? Before this semester I had a 3.0 and a 1230 on the new SAT but this semester I had to withdraw from a class (for good reason) so I final grades this semester are a W, two B+, and a C+. Should I submit my grades now or try and wait longer to send them? Will these grades increase or decrease my chance of getting in to fall 2018? Thanks <eos> \n",

I don't know if East IM has actual lifting equipment, but if it doesn't, I wouldn't mind going to West IM. Would anyone be interested in joining me? If not, might anyone know of any other forum where I could find an MSU/local workout buddy? <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Pretty simple question: How many of you took more than two years of a foreign language in HS? I'm looking at MSU, BGSU, GVSU, OU, ISU, and a few others for when I graduate. Spanish is not my strongest subject, and at this point, all it does is drag my GPA down. I'd like to bring my GPA up and not have to worry about Spanish anymore. I don't know how big of a factor if at all it would be in the application process. I'm able to keep a B in the class, maybe a B+ if I'm lucky, but my school decided to use the IB curriculum for Spanish (which I did not sign up for) and it only seems to become more frustrating as time goes on. By the time I graduate, I'll have taken 6 or 7 APs and one honors course. <eos> \n",

I can sort of understand how college kids get BMW's, but I have seen Maseratis, Aston Martins and Lamborghinis on campus just to name a few. I am not trying to be racist, nor do I mean to lump all of Asia into one ethnicity, but it is predominately people of Asian (for a lack of better word) decent who are driving these cars. I am honestly curious how one comes by these cars? Are they bought? Leased? Parents buy them? Is there a secret MSU racing club? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, and sorry if I offended anyone.  EDIT: Because apparently Reddit takes everything seriously. No, I don't actually think there is an underground MSU racing club.....yet.  <eos> \n",

Patterns of individual and collective action. Violence and conflict resolution.\", so it's more like technical aspect, nah, seems boring now. So, which ISS class is the least boring? Nevermind the professors, just the class itself. Imagine if you had to read everything by yourself - which class would've been the most pleasurable?

            "<bos> I'm an incoming freshman, and I really can't decide if I should say I prefer a quiet floor or not. I can sleep through basically anything, and I'll probably always do homework with earbuds in or music on.  I'm gonna try to be as social as possible in college, as I wasn't really in high school, but I wish I was. That makes me think that I should go for a non-quiet floor. But, I don't want the floor to be filled with annoying future frat guys that blast music and scream back and forth. Would it be easier to find guys that care a little more about school and a little less about partying and football on a quiet floor? I'm gonna probably do both, but I don't want to be around guys who only care about that and couldn't give two shits about classes.  How quiet are the quiet floors? I don't want to be in a library-like environment for the entire year.  Also, it asks if I would prefer alcohol-free or not, or no preference. I would guess that most put no, that they don't mind alcohol, but it almost seems like a trick question, because I've seen things about people getting in trouble for alcohol in dorms.  Thanks for the advice in advance.  <eos> \n",

Now, I'm on my own with no extra furniture or person and I'm not having my bed lofted. What can I fit? I want a TV and a futon but realistically I probably can't fit those in there.

Now I believe I have the ability to do well on the LSAT, however my gpa is very low (2.6) and am trying to figure out how to negate such a low score. Would I be able to take 20 online credits (post graduation mind you) and ace them all thus raising my gpa? Could I proclaim I'm taking another major and simply \"drop out\" once I get my gpa at a certain number? Thanks everyone!  <eos> \n",

I usually work out at IM West 4-6 days a week for about an 1-1.5 hours each day. I do enjoy working out alone but I miss having a partner to talk to, maybe a couple of times a week. I usually go in the AM but I am very flexible. I started working out in high school and have been interested in really taking care of myself ever since. I really need to branch out to escape my routine.

This morning, however, when I logged into my stuinfo, I noticed that all of that was gone. I have a MSU assistance grant for much less than I originally did. No pell grant. And for some reason it says I have to accept my stafford loans again? Any ideas? Has this happened to anyone else? I'm planning on calling the office on monday.  <eos> \n",

Now this isn't a problem, I've already made the appointment, but for this semester, I have a really hard suite of classes, and I wanted to drop one to make time for the others.  The issue at hand is: that the class I wish to drop is a prerequisite for another class I'm enrolled in right now, and what I'm asking is: does anybody know if dropping the one would have any negative repercussions toward my status in the other? Would I have to see my professor in one/both of them, or make an advisor appointment?  Thanks in advance. <eos> \n",

Last year I was in McDonel with a single room so I know Mason-Abbot will be smaller with low ceilings but that’s about it. How much closet space is there? What are the floors like? I had carpet last year but if the floor is decent I don’t want to haul the carpet up three flights of stairs... I have a loveseat, fridge, and small desk/vanity I’m hoping will fit but not confident I can make it work 😬 <eos> \n",

I have only visited once, (snowboard trip to Steamboat), but I immediately fell in love with the laid back atmosphere. That, combined with the fact that it is the \"healthiest\" state in the US intriques me immensely. I am 27/f, optimistic, and ready to try (almost) anything. I have 6 years of Michigan State University under my belt because I toured every major in the business college, plus any classes that interested me. :) I would eventually like to finish my degree, but am unsure of whether it will be in my current marketing major. I have a lot of experience in apartment leasing, among other customer service based jobs. One of my new interests is integrative nutrition and overall wellness for the mind, body, and soul.  If anyone has suggestions as far as preparation, location, job opportunities, or living situations, I'd greatly appreciate it! I'm even open to splitting moving costs and/or rooming with someone from the area. Let's hear it! Thanks in advance! TL;DR Need advice, roomies, or job opportunities in Colorado. Even better, I would like to meet a fellow Spartan with similar dreams.  <eos> \n",

Obviously, getting the handwriting spot-on is immensely important to me, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any local parlors with a strong reputation for handwriting replication. And unless you know for sure Splash of Color has an amazing record of handwriting tattoos, please don't recommend them. I went there for a tattoo on the back of my neck and had a horrible experience with them, would prefer not to go back. <eos> \n",

The class that transfers is called CIS-1050 and I have the option of taking the class online or actually attending a weekly lecture for 3.75 hours. Should I take it online, or in an actual class setting? Also I've heard some people saying you have to take it at MSU to get into the business school. Is this the case even if the credit is transferable?  <eos> \n",

A lot of the trees in campus have little plaques attached that say the species and a little blurb about them. Many of these trees are from Asia or Europe. It would be cool if I could search a species, and it tells me where they are located. Or if I looked at a location, tell me all species of tree that is there. Doesn't have to be every single tree, just the noteworthy ones.  <eos> \n",

I'm already personally bummed since the few people I have met on the MSU Facebook page all have my previous dates! Real bummer but I'm trying to find positives. My main concern is being able to have a good schedule! Will having a later date cause me to have a sucky schedule now since everyone else got first dibs? Or is there a way to put in for classes before orientation time? Does it even effect class choices at all?  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi everyone! I am looking for some information about scholarships for MSU and I figured this might be a good place to ask. I am very worried and I would like some answers now so that I can relax over the holidays. I was accepted into MSU in October and invited to Honors College in November. Just recently I received an invitation for the ADS Competition. However, I am confused about receiving merit-based scholarships and other types of scholarships. I went back and looked at my Honors College invitation and the only scholarship thing they mention is the ADS Competiton. My offical acceptance letter did not mention scholarships at all. So, is my only chance at earning money at all through State beating out ~1300 of the school's top applicants? Here are some things about me: UW GPA: 3.98 W GPA: 4.3 SAT: 1490 10 AP Classes total, enrolled in 4 right now. I received 5's on all exams taken so far besides 2 of them (4's). Rank: #2 out of 365 I am in marching band as brass captain and lead trumpet, and I am in NHS as well. I live in Michigan. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I have not seen too many carpool apps executed well that work to connect students who drive to class. Parking can get very expensive if you drive alone, which I normally do. I think a good approach to lower parking costs per student is to create an app that verifies your identity as a msu student by each class you are enrolled in.  There would be several issues with this, such as security and confirming students' identities and that they are enrolled in the class (which would need university permission/data), determining how to split up the costs, marketing it to students who are indifferent to save money (maybe their parents pay for parking, or prefer to drive only alone or with friends), and ultimately creating an app that could handle that much data input from the payment to the confirmation of actually going to class on a given day. Winters are an advantage to this idea, because the CATA bus actually gets so full that they will literally stop picking up students at certain stops. Another advantage is obviously saving significant money over time. Say from now until the end of this semester, you pay $15 per week to park, so $60 in a month. Even if you only have 4 people who agree to carpool, thats only $15 per month.  An alternative to an expensive app which might make more sense is to have just a platform for students to find others who want to carpool for an entire month and be more long term focused rather than short term. I realize the issues with this idea, but that doesn't mean its impossible to accomplish. There are endless ways to approach this issue, so I was wondering what anybody's thoughts are on this whole idea or what you think is the best way to go about this? Also, if there any developers out there who may want to work towards this idea feel free to reach out.  <eos> \n",

Now what? I don't know what I should be doing to prepare for my first semester at MSU. I've received nothing from MSU as far as scholarships, which I was honestly expecting by now (30 ACT/3.9 GPA should get me something small at least, right?) Furthermore, I don't know what else I should be doing, be it online or in person, as far as paperwork or submitting forms or anything for classes or what. Am I getting ahead of myself, since it's only February? Or what else should I be doing at this point? If anyone could offer some pointers, it would be much appreciated!

I'm a sociology/public health student at another American public university, and I'm conducting a study about hookup subculture on college campuses.  If you answered yes both of the above, I'd be incredibly grateful for ~10 minutes of your time to share your experiences and perspectives via online survey.  A few things you might want to know off the bat: Responses are confidential—the information you provide is tied to a code number, not an email address, name, etc. Data will be compiled, then presented to the sociology department for academic credit. This data will not be published in an academic journal. Anyone who participates is invited to request a copy of the results. (I plan to post a copy on r/SampleSize as well.) If you have any other questions about the survey or how it will be used, I'd be more than happy to go into greater depth.  If you're down to help me out, thank you(!), and here's a link to the survey: [url link] Thanks so much! Cheers!  <eos> \n",

For those of you that play League of Legends, there's a club here at MSU that meets once a week and hosts tournaments and other events and such.

We've been here for about 3 months and no one noticed this writing before. It said, \"Nothing tastes as good as skinny.\" I know this is a Kate Moss quote, but still weird.

My account was incorrectly marked by the OFA as in \"Denial Due to SAP\" when I had, in fact, simply been selected for FAFSA verification. I'm taking classes after a long while and am just a bit worried that my aid may not be approved by the beginning of May. I know the semester doesn't start until the 16th or so, but I'm already getting anxious about the wait.  Thanks!  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I parked in the commuter lot today but I don't have my parking pass yet. I know in the fall they wait 1-2 weeks before they start handing out tickets, so I was wondering if anybody knew if the same was true for second semester? And if I do, can I prove that I bought a parking pass for that particular vehicle and get the fine waived? Really don't want to leave class to come back to a parking ticket for a lot I bought a pass for... <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So my AOP is tomorrow and I'm sort of worried about what to expect. I'm going into CS with little knowledge on the specific classes I want to take at MSU. I've even seen some people say the advisers will berate you for not researching classes... I guess my question is what exactly should we should know going into AOP in regards to schedules, especially for CS.  Also, we're allowed to take ID photos at AOP, right? I literally just took a selfie near a white wall in my house because they rejected my last one today (was a professional picture too...). It actually came out pretty good, but they're probably going to reject it like my last one. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hi I'm a freshman marketing student here at Michigan State. Its still early in the semester so I have time to make changes to my habits if needed. I am in the Residential Business Program which gives me people who are also business students to study with.   I just wanted to know if there were any business students (preferably ones who have been admitted into Broad) who had any advice for a freshman?  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> A little background: My high school GPA had, up until eighth semester, been totally fine, mostly an A/B student, took a lot of AP classes, 1420 on the SAT, etc. But this last semester of high school, I was failed in my Computer Science Principles class. (This class is a joke, btw, which might make the fact that I failed it look even worse). Long story short, somewhere along the line I got on bad terms with the teacher of the class, and to be honest, I'm not totally sure how; there were some extremely disrespectful kids in that class, openly screaming and cursing, that she didn't seem to have a problem with, but possibly the fact that I didn't take her class that seriously pissed her off. First semester I received an A, but by second semester she really seemed to have it in for me, and it was during this time I missed a lot of class, for a multitude of reasons, and therefore had a lot of late assignments. During the beginning of the school year she told the class she had a very relaxed policy for late assignments, and would practically accept any assignment at any time, as long as it was completed. However, when I came back after a long absence in second semester, she refused to grade any of my work, including the final exam for that class, and instead yelled at me for not doing my work (which I had). She pretended not to have received any of my work, even though I am 100% positive I emailed it to her multiple times, (the class is online), and through multiple different platforms. I highly suspect she was lying and simply wanted to fail me, which she did. And now today I received an email from MSU stating that my performance in my eighth semester was \"far below\" their expectations. My point of writing all of this here instead of in an email to MSU is that I'm not sure if I should just blame my teacher, even though realistically that was the entire problem. I don't know how MSU is, but during high school I could never get away with just blaming the teacher. My school would sooner believe it was my fault than any teacher's, especially under accusations as ridiculous as these. So, is it better to just tell the unfiltered truth, or should I just make something up and talk about how I had a bunch of AP classes and buckled under the pressure or something? <eos> \n",

His team is going to the Spartans game tomorrow night and he asked me if I wanted to come. They all have tickets but I don't. Should I buy a ticket off stubhub or am I just able to buy a ticket at the gate? Will it be sold out or something or am I good? I'm asking bc I don't have a printer thx 4 info <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hey, I'm admitted and planning on attending this uni and had some questions before making my final decision. Planning to visit soon. -Best dorm for freshman? I know Case, Shaw and Hubbard are pretty good, but how are they? Are the rooms big or small? -I heard the water tastes horrible. Since MSU gives water bottles so you can refill it, does the water taste like garbage? That's what I've heard. - How crowded does it get with 50000 kids on campus? Are the class sizes huge?  -Ive heard the food is good, is that true?  - Is air conditioning a big must? If I don't have an air conditioned room will I be sweaty all the time?  Thanks for answering! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Like the title says, I was wondering what people thought about people riding their bikes on campus. 99.9% of riders ride on the sidewalk, and I see occasional close calls between pedestrians and bikers because of it. I personally ride my bike to get around fast and try to be as safe and sensible about it as possible (keeping my head on a swivel, taking less busy paths, walking my bike in crowded areas, etc). So as I biker, I want to know your thoughts on how you see people on bikes, what can be improved on, and if bikers are even a blip on your radar at all. Thanks for reading! <eos> \n",

I'm heavily considering this, and I just wanted to know from some others who might have done this previously. Has it always been free during the summer? Also can you get a permanent single? I know they're available in Brody which is where they're offering this but I just really don't want a roommate at all for the rest of my time at MSU tbh. I emailed housing and asked if I could just pay the difference between a double and a single and they just said that \"more info would be available in the spring\" which is when enrollment starts for the summer housing.  I just want to get an early jump on this so I know what I'm doing and can snag a single if the opportunity presents itself. Any experience with this? Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

I would assume we can use combos at the others since there’s a replicate of the pizzeria in the union that you can use your combo at. Just wondering about panda and subway.

I am interested in a lot of stuff, and become interested very easy, but I want classes I won't have to put a ton of time into, and still get a good grade.  So, what are your class/professor recommendations? (Can be for any semester summer-next spring, and any subject, just easy, or fairly easy but super-awesome).  Edit: Online classes are awesome too. I love doing stuff on my own time, haha. <eos> \n",

I felt I understood everything when taking it and actually enjoyed the class.

My question is will the school know if I don't complete all of those? The guy at the agency in charge of my scheduling doesn't seem to like to give me my hours so for now I have been just bullshitting it on my journals where I record my hours I've worked. If I say that I have completed my hours, will they find out otherwise?  <eos> \n",

If yes, what would be a good day and time to arrange such a thing? I know finals are coming up and that may make things a bit difficult for some. EDIT/UPDATE: Current plan seems to be Zangzabar's suggestion: How about a coffee morning Saturday, April 28th? Grand Traverse Pie Company on Grand River. Lots of parking, and good atmosphere in the morning. Also... Pie. In the morning. The time proposal is around 9.30-10. Everyone has exams so this will add in study time. How many of you would be ok with this? EDIT/UPDATE: I completely missed the fact that the MACRAs are this weekend, and being on the crew team I may be in Grand Rapids at the time without a teleporter. :/ But that's my personal qualm.

            "<bos> Hey all,  I've been out of school for a couple years.  Partway through my junior year, a close friend of mine died unexpectedly. Rather than seeking out professional help, I drowned myself in alcohol for the following months. The results were somewhat predictable -- my academics went to bunk, I was put on probation, final probation, and eventually told to take a break.  I'm in my mid-twenties now and want to wrap up my last three or so semesters at Michigan State and move on with life. I've been taking online classes -- MOOCs -- to meet MSU's readmission requirements. Overall, I think I'm much more motivated to succeed than I was back in 2014 and 2015.  Does anyone have experience with the readmission process? Are they generally quite harsh in taking former flunks back, even if they've adhered to the readmission guidelines? Will getting financial aid back be very difficult (I can't afford to go to school without at least loans)?  Really looking forward to getting myself back on track and wrapping up my degree. Any advice or insight is very welcome.  Also -- do you need to interview for readmission, or is that for recess appeals only? I'm out of the country now.  edit: Figured I'd mention that I have been in touch with the designated academics counselor for my college. He's approved all my MOOCs to date but hasn't been very communicate otherwise, which is why I'm here.  <eos> \n",

I'm 24 and have come a long way in my career in a short time frame, without bitcoin being involved on my resume (so far) At a bitcoin conference in North Carolina, I became privy to the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), hung out with them for just about an entire day at the conference talking about bitcoin, politics, business and everything us millennials are into now a days lol Needless to say was an epic group, and a few of them were from MSU and mentioned there is already a CCN \"chapter\" (not sure what to call it, forgive me) here at MSU. I am talking at the College of Education IT Conference in November on bitcoin, and am trying to begin drumming up support/attention.

Living in north neighborhood where Landon (amazing) closes at 8, everyone goes to late night around 10 or 11, and now no late night on weekends because of “less traffic”.... just because a lot of people are going out doesn’t mean there are some of us wanna eat there still.  And not to mention my buddy who works at late night said the best option (quesadillas) will not be returning.... Clearly the majority is unhappy with these new changes and I think we should work on getting this changed. I already contacted them via email but they have to understand that it’s never going to be convieniet walking to a whole different neighborhood to get some food when we are hungry later at night. <eos> \n",

I’ve tried making friends on my floor but at least 70% of the floor is Chinese Gentleman that like to stick to video games and their friends from back home.

The content is still completely legible but the page ripped from the ring holding it in place.  Would the MSU Student Bookstore charge me for a replacement? I ask because I'm about to leave the country for the rest of the semester--I was planning to return my book Saturday morning, but would rather just pay the replacement fee when I come home if it's too \"damaged\" to be returned. Basically, I'd rather have the extra $100 to spend in India then here in East Lansing.  I'll probably just call the SBS and ask tomorrow but figured somebody here may have done the same before.

I have a 3.0 with roughly 40 credits at my current university. However, I have retaken a class or two and I wonder if that will impact my admissibility into MSU. I hear different things about how MSU calculates transfer GPA's. If they calculate all attempts, then this would put me under a 3.0, significantly harming my chances of being admitted. I also hear that MSU will look at both the GPA you have with retakes and the GPA you have after they recalculated it. So basically my question is, even though I have a 3.0, will retakes kill my chances? <eos> \", '<bos> I\\'m so excited about going to MSU this fall, but I\\'m a little worried about homesickness.

I don't know if many of you are familiar with Abbott place apartments but they were kind of my dream complex that fit my picky requisites pretty well.  So I go up to EL, do the tour fill out some paperwork and even interview for a position there all while waiting for my paycheck to snag one of at the time the 3 remaining 1 beds. Ring Them up within 48 hours later and they booked them all for other people. Which stunk out loud because they're still emailing me, and mailing me flyers after not holding an apartment for me (which I understand is policy it just blows chunks). They put me 1st on a wait list and said my chances are slim but really told me to essentially take matters into my own hands if it's that important to me.  In my undergrad apartment experience it was pretty common for folks to kinda hunt down potential lease breakers and get their units - all sorts of crazy tactics to get units. I came from a low supply high demand student apartment market. My question for y'all really pertains to the commonality of this approach up there. I know leases work different ways state to state and I even have a backup apartment all ready which will be okay, just far more expensive. I just want to make sure I've done everything in my power before giving up on Abbott place and signing a lease for somewhere else.  Any advice would be very appreciated. I'm just pretty confused relocating and looking for some local business tricks or advice for my situation.

Their punishment: they had to move out of the dorms. MSU did nothing else about it. I learned about this story way before the Larry Nassar scandal emerged, the shame of MSU and MSUCOM. Apparently, the girls who waved an \"Expel rapists\" sign at an event got booed by over 10k people at the stadium and were escorted out by police. Lou Anna didn\\'t do anything then. She defended inviting a rape apologist to speak at MSU years later, and she knew about Larry Nassar, as did Dean Strampel, a rapist himself, who \"stepped down\" only because of a stroke.

I guess it boils down to the idea I dislike growth for the sake of growth without a plan. What is the purpose of a 'successful' athletic department if it comes at the same time as rising tuition costs. I see the purpose of a university as a place of higher education first. When our students accept the tuition hikes without protest (as is natural with any student I haven't been here forever, but I have yet to see anything substantial) while celebrating how great we are at sports it seems we implicitly accept this order of things. I don't.   Is my anger a bit misguided? Perhaps. But what if students stopped showing up at sporting events in protest of tuition hikes? What if we took a stand and said no new luxury add-ons until we address the systematic problems with higher education? I understand sports are extremely popular. To me, that is how students might be able to actually change something, by letting the university know we don't care if our football team is good if actually attending this university cripples us in debt.  I don't want to project blind anger, which I assuredly did in this post. I just wish there was a broader discussion within the student population about the direction of our university and what the plan is long-term to make this a place students can learn without fear of life-long debt.    <eos> \", \"<bos> I'm a freshman, just moved in, hungry, but don't have my ID yet as my AOP is tomorrow Is it possible to eat at a caf without an id? <eos> \", \"<bos> I have my MSU mail account linked to my iPhone and it's set to fetch every 30 minutes the problem is I'll notice I'll have the badge notifications next to mail but it won't ring or send notifications when I get new mail.

I struggled a bit this semester, as I took the previous Fall semester off to focus on work and making money, and had a hard time adjusting back to school life. This Spring semester I took 14 credits and this summer I will be taking another 15, altogether reaching/passing MSU's transfer requirement of 28 credits. They have only asked for spring grades on my decision letter, so I would appreciate someone to honestly chance my application: MTH 116 (4cr): C+ (2.3) | WRA 100 (3cr): A- (3.7) | HIS 1510 (4cr): A (4.0) | PSY 101 (3cr): B (3.0) |  MTH 116 is the last math course needed to transfer to MSU and that is the main source of my worry.

I have a question regarding housing contract cancellations for on-campus living if anyone has any experience.  Background information: I am an international student, and will be a junior this coming fall semester. I signed up to live on campus at Williams hall about a month ago, so I\\'m past the 14 day cancellation period.  Due to developments in my personal life, it is becoming apparent that living on will not be desirable nor practical.  Now, considering the billing process hasn\\'t even begun yet, does anyone know how to possibly cancel the contract without any losses? I understand that they do offer a \"buyout\" option, but as far as I could gather they bill you 60% of the price of the dorm for the full year, which seems unreasonable considering the fact that the billing process hasn\\'t even begun and neither has the semester.

I have a MESP (MIsaves) account, and i\\'m wondering if I should pay the total cost of my first semester (\\\\~$12k), or just the minimum payment due (\\\\~$5k). I realize I need to pay the total cost eventually (obviously), but I was wondering if there were specific consequences for people who either pay all at once versus those who pay the minimum. If I were to pay anything at all, it would be under a mailed check. So, would there be a processing fee for paying once / double fee for paying twice? Also, there is a line-item in my mailing bill that mentions the total payment (\\\\~$12k) voiding a \"**To Avoid Pmt Plan**.\" I\\'m assuming that if you don\\'t pay the total cost, you will be put on some sort of payment plan to make you pay the rest of the cost.

I recently made the choice to go to Jackson College this fall to knock out my pre-reqs before going to MSU. My original plan was to go Fall 2018 for all four years.

I think I might have made a mistake while applying though. A quick summary of my educational background: Homeschooled, 24 on my ACT, and two community college courses. I graduated highschool in 2015, I pretty much took a year off and did two online community college courses in that time. I applied for fall semester of 2016 at MSU this past January. I thought I applied as a freshman and not a college transfer. They gave me a decision letter they gave me when they told me I was not accepted. In that letter they mention that I don't have enough college credits to transfer to MSU.

Would’ve addressed sooner, however didn’t plan to use again until now. Think it may be an electrical issue.  TaoTao 50cc (Spare me the “shouldn’t buy a cheap scooter” comments lol) Symptoms and such: - One day, after having ridden for majority of fall semester, did not receive any response from scooter when turning the key and pressing starter. - When inserting and turning key, the gas and other gauges do not move, nor do lights come on as they normally would.  - No response/turnover whatsoever from my electric starter. Kick start never really worked, maybe because I only ever used the electric start, idk. - Have taken out battery, charged, and tested. This does not seem to be the issue. - Haven’t tested spark plug, although if that was the issue, I feel like the gauges and lights would activate upon turning the key. - Have always remembered to hold break while attempting to start, moped is “on”  Thanks  <eos> ', \"<bos> I got in to BMB 401 without realizing that CEM 352 was a prereq for it.

In the pile-on phase, there were the \"burn the stadium, salt the earth\" comments... in PSU case, we had the threat of being DECERTIFIED as a University, academically.

One thing the tour guide said that surprised me was \"MSU is the #1 astrophysics school in the US\" (Astrophysics is what I want to study). Prior to my visit, I did some research on the internet to find which schools had the best astrophysics programs, and a particular list UM ranked above MSU (~20 to ~40 in the nation). Notably, MSU was far from #1. [Here\\'s the list I\\'m referring to.]([url link] I talked to the tour guide personally after the tour and she said that MSU was #1 because undergrads had numerous opportunities to participate in graduate-level research. From what I have seen, it seems that UM has [very similar opportunities.]([url link] I was hoping to learn the opinions of some of MSU\\'s astrophysics students. I thought that perhaps the tour guide said this as an attempt to further \"sell\" the university to us in the group (I wasn\\'t the only prospective student there that was interested in astrophysics) or if the websites that I have found this list on is less than reputable or doesn\\'t take everything into account.

I was wondering if anyone knew about what options are available for an internet provider. I know that the DTN people I've spoken with have all mentioned Comcast, but given their reputation, I'd rather go with someone else if possible. I saw a post on here from a while back that mentioned GoLightSpeed fiber, and it appears that 144 Highland is within their service range. However, according to GoLightSpeed's FAQ I would have to get an installation cleared with DTN, since they may have some sort of exclusivity agreement. Does anyone here have experience with DTN on that issue? Do they allow other ISPs, or just Comcast? I'd also love to hear if anyone knows of any other alternatives I could look into.

In terms of the experiential profile and case study, I believe I did pretty well; however, my grades are what scares me more. At the end of Fall I believe I will have a 3.195 or 3.2-ish. This is due to my utter incompetence in economics. I got a 2.5 in EC-202 and EC-201 I feel as though I’ll do the same (I’m shooting for a 3.0). As for my pre-core GPA, I haven’t got my CSE-101 grade yet, but it’s likely 3.0, and my Calc grade is 4.0. My overall pre-core is then 3.5 (I took WRA at a community college).

Now this isn't a problem, I've already made the appointment, but for this semester, I have a really hard suite of classes, and I wanted to drop one to make time for the others.  The issue at hand is: that the class I wish to drop is a prerequisite for another class I'm enrolled in right now, and what I'm asking is: does anybody know if dropping the one would have any negative repercussions toward my status in the other?

I\\'ve made it my 3-4 month goal to find employment and move to Colorado. I have only visited once, (snowboard trip to Steamboat), but I immediately fell in love with the laid back atmosphere.

I am very worried and I would like some answers now so that I can relax over the holidays. I was accepted into MSU in October and invited to Honors College in November. Just recently I received an invitation for the ADS Competition. However, I am confused about receiving merit-based scholarships and other types of scholarships. I went back and looked at my Honors College invitation and the only scholarship thing they mention is the ADS Competiton. My offical acceptance letter did not mention scholarships at all. So, is my only chance at earning money at all through State beating out ~1300 of the school's top applicants? Here are some things about me: UW GPA: 3.98 W GPA: 4.3 SAT: 1490 10 AP Classes total, enrolled in 4 right now. I received 5's on all exams taken so far besides 2 of them (4's). Rank: #2 out of 365 I am in marching band as brass captain and lead trumpet, and I am in NHS as well.

Parking can get very expensive if you drive alone, which I normally do. I think a good approach to lower parking costs per student is to create an app that verifies your identity as a msu student by each class you are enrolled in.  There would be several issues with this, such as security and confirming students' identities and that they are enrolled in the class (which would need university permission/data), determining how to split up the costs, marketing it to students who are indifferent to save money (maybe their parents pay for parking, or prefer to drive only alone or with friends), and ultimately creating an app that could handle that much data input from the payment to the confirmation of actually going to class on a given day. Winters are an advantage to this idea, because the CATA bus actually gets so full that they will literally stop picking up students at certain stops. Another advantage is obviously saving significant money over time. Say from now until the end of this semester, you pay $15 per week to park, so $60 in a month. Even if you only have 4 people who agree to carpool, thats only $15 per month.  An alternative to an expensive app which might make more sense is to have just a platform for students to find others who want to carpool for an entire month and be more long term focused rather than short term. I realize the issues with this idea, but that doesn't mean its impossible to accomplish. There are endless ways to approach this issue, so I was wondering what anybody's thoughts are on this whole idea or what you think is the best way to go about this? Also, if there any developers out there who may want to work towards this idea feel free to reach out.  <eos> \", \"<bos> Got back to my car today and my car was ticketed for a Pay by Plate violation even with the Lot 89 permit, and the cars around mine had tickets on the windshield as well, just a heads up.

Are you 18-24 and currently enrolled at Michigan State? Have you read or heard anything about 'hook-up culture', or participated in it yourself?

(This class is a joke, btw, which might make the fact that I failed it look even worse). Long story short, somewhere along the line I got on bad terms with the teacher of the class, and to be honest, I\\'m not totally sure how; there were some extremely disrespectful kids in that class, openly screaming and cursing, that she didn\\'t seem to have a problem with, but possibly the fact that I didn\\'t take her class that seriously pissed her off. First semester I received an A, but by second semester she really seemed to have it in for me, and it was during this time I missed a lot of class, for a multitude of reasons, and therefore had a lot of late assignments. During the beginning of the school year she told the class she had a very relaxed policy for late assignments, and would practically accept any assignment at any time, as long as it was completed. However, when I came back after a long absence in second semester, she refused to grade any of my work, including the final exam for that class, and instead yelled at me for not doing my work (which I had). She pretended not to have received any of my work, even though I am 100% positive I emailed it to her multiple times, (the class is online), and through multiple different platforms. I highly suspect she was lying and simply wanted to fail me, which she did. And now today I received an email from MSU stating that my performance in my eighth semester was \"far below\" their expectations. My point of writing all of this here instead of in an email to MSU is that I\\'m not sure if I should just blame my teacher, even though realistically that was the entire problem. I don\\'t know how MSU is, but during high school I could never get away with just blaming the teacher. My school would sooner believe it was my fault than any teacher\\'s, especially under accusations as ridiculous as these. So, is it better to just tell the unfiltered truth, or should I just make something up and talk about how I had a bunch of AP classes and buckled under the pressure or something? <eos> ', '<bos> Has anyone taken PSY 200 with Becker?

Planning to visit soon. -Best dorm for freshman? I know Case, Shaw and Hubbard are pretty good, but how are they? Are the rooms big or small? -I heard the water tastes horrible. Since MSU gives water bottles so you can refill it, does the water taste like garbage? That's what I've heard. - How crowded does it get with 50000 kids on campus? Are the class sizes huge?  -Ive heard the food is good, is that true?  - Is air conditioning a big must? If I don't have an air conditioned room will I be sweaty all the time?  Thanks for answering! <eos> \", '<bos> Like the title says, I was wondering what people thought about people riding their bikes on campus. 99.9% of riders ride on the sidewalk, and I see occasional close calls between pedestrians and bikers because of it. I personally ride my bike to get around fast and try to be as safe and sensible about it as possible (keeping my head on a swivel, taking less busy paths, walking my bike in crowded areas, etc). So as I biker, I want to know your thoughts on how you see people on bikes, what can be improved on, and if bikers are even a blip on your radar at all. Thanks for reading! <eos> ', '<bos> Hey!

I\\'m heavily considering this, and I just wanted to know from some others who might have done this previously. Has it always been free during the summer? Also can you get a permanent single? I know they\\'re available in Brody which is where they\\'re offering this but I just really don\\'t want a roommate at all for the rest of my time at MSU tbh. I emailed housing and asked if I could just pay the difference between a double and a single and they just said that \"more info would be available in the spring\" which is when enrollment starts for the summer housing.

My question is will the school know if I don't complete all of those? The guy at the agency in charge of my scheduling doesn't seem to like to give me my hours so for now I have been just bullshitting it on my journals where I record my hours I've worked. If I say that I have completed my hours, will they find out otherwise?  <eos> \", \"<bos> So I realized that I wouldn't need to take ISS 210 as I have already fulfilled the requirement with my high school Economics credit.

How many of you would actually want to do this (and not flake off). If yes, what would be a good day and time to arrange such a thing? I know finals are coming up and that may make things a bit difficult for some. EDIT/UPDATE: Current plan seems to be Zangzabar's suggestion: How about a coffee morning Saturday, April 28th? Grand Traverse Pie Company on Grand River. Lots of parking, and good atmosphere in the morning. Also... Pie. In the morning. The time proposal is around 9.30-10. Everyone has exams so this will add in study time. How many of you would be ok with this?

Rather than seeking out professional help, I drowned myself in alcohol for the following months. The results were somewhat predictable -- my academics went to bunk, I was put on probation, final probation, and eventually told to take a break.  I'm in my mid-twenties now and want to wrap up my last three or so semesters at Michigan State and move on with life. I've been taking online classes -- MOOCs -- to meet MSU's readmission requirements. Overall, I think I'm much more motivated to succeed than I was back in 2014 and 2015.  Does anyone have experience with the readmission process? Are they generally quite harsh in taking former flunks back, even if they've adhered to the readmission guidelines? Will getting financial aid back be very difficult (I can't afford to go to school without at least loans)?  Really looking forward to getting myself back on track and wrapping up my degree. Any advice or insight is very welcome.  Also -- do you need to interview for readmission, or is that for recess appeals only? I'm out of the country now.  edit: Figured I'd mention that I have been in touch with the designated academics counselor for my college. He's approved all my MOOCs to date but hasn't been very communicate otherwise, which is why I'm here.  <eos> \", '<bos> I\\'m not a student at MSU, but am faculty staff (technologist/programmer). I\\'m 24 and have come a long way in my career in a short time frame, without bitcoin being involved on my resume (so far) At a bitcoin conference in North Carolina, I became privy to the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), hung out with them for just about an entire day at the conference talking about bitcoin, politics, business and everything us millennials are into now a days lol Needless to say was an epic group, and a few of them were from MSU and mentioned there is already a CCN \"chapter\" (not sure what to call it, forgive me) here at MSU.

Living in north neighborhood where Landon (amazing) closes at 8, everyone goes to late night around 10 or 11, and now no late night on weekends because of “less traffic”.... just because a lot of people are going out doesn’t mean there are some of us wanna eat there still.  And not to mention my buddy who works at late night said the best option (quesadillas) will not be returning.... Clearly the majority is unhappy with these new changes and I think we should work on getting this changed.

My current time here at state is going pretty good, met some super nice people, but no one is really opening up. I’ve joined a few clubs and haven’t really found some people that fit in with myself. I’ve tried making friends on my floor but at least 70% of the floor is Chinese Gentleman that like to stick to video games and their friends from back home.

I accidentally damaged a single page of a 300-page loose-leaf text. The content is still completely legible but the page ripped from the ring holding it in place.  Would the MSU Student Bookstore charge me for a replacement? I ask because I\\'m about to leave the country for the rest of the semester--I was planning to return my book Saturday morning, but would rather just pay the replacement fee when I come home if it\\'s too \"damaged\" to be returned. Basically, I\\'d rather have the extra $100 to spend in India then here in East Lansing.  I\\'ll probably just call the SBS and ask tomorrow but figured somebody here may have done the same before.
