Is there a place in Lincoln that does something like a nacho bar to go, where you can go in and get nachos made up with the cheese, meat, and whatever toppings you desire on them? I went to college in Wayne, and for anyone that's been there, they know the Mucho Nacho from the gas station can be a great stop for food after going through the bars. While it doesn't have to be a \"gas station nacho bar\" by any means, and again, I certainly understand it's weird, but is there a place in Lincoln that has this? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Does anybody here have any experience with the Modern Language major at Wesleyan? Specifically their German concentration? Looking at going back to uni after a disastrous year at UNL and wanted to know about their program? How intensive is it? Would you say you think you're nearing fluency?  After I graduate I would like to pursue education in Germany and I don't want to be one of those foreign students expecting everything to be in English. Perhaps most important, how are the FACULTY? I don't want to get two years in before I find the upper level faculty to be horrible and completely insufferable. <eos> \n",

Obviously, the idea of doing that to myself, but mainly my car and my wallet, every 5 days makes me feel bad feelings.  Does anyone out there commute from Lincoln to Omaha? Are there any established carpools? If not would you like to establish one with me? Thank you. <eos> \n",

I'll head to the Mill a little before hand and grab some seats. I will also print out a reddit alien to put on the table so people will know where we're at.  Depending on who shows up and what everyone's feeling up to after we could hit up downtown and have some drinks as some of you indicated. Hope to see you all there!  **EDIT** If you can post an RSVP here so I can get a rough idea of how many people might be coming that would be extremely helpful! <eos> \n",

Or if anyone is a carpet cleaning genius that can help me out, that works too, but if anyone has any recommendations, I’ll take those! We have a couple cats that peed on a rug on top of our carpet and we didn’t catch it right away...not sure how long it’s been there but it didn’t catch our nose for awhile. We’ve used a Hoover shampooer a couple times but it’s still there. Is there anyway to remove that smell if it’s deep in the carpet beyond using a shampooer? <eos> \n",

He joked about being a serial killer and stalker, which should've caused us to tell him to fuck off but we were so weirded out by him that we let him talk to us.  He asked my girlfriend a few strange vague questions, claiming to have recognized her from somewhere. She was vague as well in her answer but we think he would be able to eventually find her from the information he gathered. We need advice in this situation. Should we report suspicious activity to the police in case this guy actually is a cause of concern or should we let it blow over since it's probably nothing.  My girlfriend and I have already talked about it and she's going to be more aware of the now potential stalker, she will call the police the moment she sees him and she will be aware when she leaves work if she's being followed home or not. Any advice is helpful and appreciated. I can't tell if it's nothing or something. Thanks. <eos> \n",

This is non-business related so ideally something that isn't too expensive. *Edit* - Also... I dont need a lecture on doing my own taxes... Had a few big events and a move... I'd rather let a professional take this one. :-) <eos> \n",

We'll have primarily light to medium games there, we'll play whatever people think looks interesting. We're currently looking to play [The Grizzled]([url link] [SpyNet]([url link] and possibly [Modern Art]([url link] We'll also have a number of other games available or you're free to bring your own! Also consider joining our [Facebook Group]([url link] or check out our [BGG Guild]([url link] to see some of the game options. If something on that list catches your eye hop on Discord and ask and we can try to plan a game. Many of us are on the [Lincoln Discord Server]([url link] if you want to talk with us more or round people up for a game ahead of time. We've planned other board games through there, they've also set up a **weekly volleyball game out at Holmes Lake on Thursday evenings**. Due to the recent rain, it's been a little less consistent, so please swing by our #irl_meetup channel on Discord for more details. Sparta meetups are currently on hiatus, just like Sparta is, but we'll plan other game days outside of Wednesdays, those will also be mentioned over on Discord. If you've got an activity that you'd like some more people to join, feel free to share! We've got a wide range of interests so chances are good that you'll catch someone's attention! **Wednesday 9/26 6pm - The Mill @ Telegraph** **330 S 21st St**  <eos> \n",

Im not classically trained in programming, learning on my own time, hence the reliance on UE4 with the quality support  tuts. C++ is my primary focus as UE4 is my projected engine, but open to other platform experts. Pretty much down to cover chow(brunch,lunch,dinner) just to be able to pick your brain and ask questions. I am aware of Omaha Game Developers Association but would prefer not to commute to Omaha on a regular basis.  I know Turbine Flats has at least one developer in their units and may hit them up down the road. Recently moved back and haven't gone to as many of the Lincoln Networking events as I should. Feel free to plug any of your projects here as well. I come from film/broadcast field and enjoy helping out other creators when  where I can. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello, Just wondering if anyone knew of a good travel destination within driving distance to go at the end of March. Wanting to go somewhere for spring break and I can only get a couple days off work. Thinking about camping somewhere at this point but other suggestions are welcome. Also, should note that I'm a grad student so probably I'd like to avoid places with lots of binge drinking going on. :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I am looking for a new apartment, and GoCentury has apartments in my price range and preferred location. They have a lot of bad reviews on Google Reviews, but my senses tell me that only the outspoken minority posts such things. So now I am looking to crowdsource reviews here.

            "<bos> A friend without Reddit is currently looking for a car, so I'd like to ask those of you here what's good recently. Looking for something less than a decade old, SUV or truck. Preferably not high mileage somewhere between about $8K-10K. Financing for mid-low credit is definitely a plus. He likes Anderson based on past experience, but I figured I'd ask if anyone could vouch for other dealerships *recently* Thenaks! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello all, Here in a couple weeks I will be moving into my first house here in Lincoln and am pretty excited. As I was doing a walkthrough I noticed there were a few things I wanted to update and was just wondering if anyone has any experience or knows pricing options for a couple home improvements I want to make. These would require me to probably call on someone as my DIY skills in these departments are less than stellar to put it nicely.  What I want to do is: - Add a couple outlets to my living room that do not exist currently. I'm assuming this would require some rewiring and installation, but not being an electrician I would have no idea.  - Adding a garbage disposal to the sink in the kitchen. I believe I need to do a slight replumbing job as well as installation of the disposal, but again, not a plumber either, so I can't say for certain.  If anyone has any idea on average pricing models for these kinds of projects, or even some recommendations on who to call to inquire about it, that would be great. Thank you all! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello Everyone! Sorry for the delayed post! I've been traipsing about the great North West and haven't been minding the things I need to do. So the title says it all, the 25th we'll have a meetup at Pioneers Park! I figured I'd move the time up so we'll have some daylight. Bring a snack or something to do and we'll have a good time just enjoying the (hopefully) nice weather! Since we don't have a constraint on the size of the location I'm not going to bother with an RSVP thread. Is anyone familiar with Pioneers? If so can someone recommend a good meetup location with in the park? I've never been there and it seems like a big place. Tips or ideas would be helpful.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> It is now time to vote on the location for /r/lincoln's third 2013 meetup, and tenth official meetup, to be held the evening of **Friday, April 19th**. The meeting **time is TBD**, and will depend on the winning venue. Dino's had the second most support last time, so it returns to the ballot, among three fresh choices. Here are the four named contenders this round:  * **Dino's EastSide Grille (84th  Van Dorn)** * **Parkway Lanes (48th  Van Dorn)** * **Lucky's Lounge East (52nd  Cornhusker)** *(edited @ 30min to fix this location)* * **Sun Valley Lanes (West 'O'  Sun Valley Blvd)** One thing to keep in mind is that most of our meetups are held at *two* locations. The follow-up location tends to be within striking distance of the first, and is decided in a less formal manner -- either in the RSVP/411 thread the week of the meetup, or at the meetup itself. What we're voting on here is simply the *starting location* for this meetup. As always, you can also cast a vote for anywhere which isn't one of the four named choices, by simply naming it instead of one of the options listed above. Voting will conclude Sunday night, April 7th at 11:59pm. At that point, all responses will be tallied and the winner will be determined. An RSVP/411 thread will be created the week of the meetup to gauge attendance and provide additional information for anyone showing up. ***Please reply with your vote!*** <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My work history is crap and I understand this but I have a degree in the medical field. My anxiety was overwhelming to the point I could not take it anymore. The last three years of employment have been all lies. I dont like the medical field but I have nothing else to offer. I have one more month of rent and dont know what to do after that. No place will hire me now. I feel like im done for. This ia the beginning of the end people. I did this all to myself. I shouldnt have picked up that bottle. The DTs wouldn't make me stop. This is so overwhelming right now. There is no safety net anymore. This is the last chapter of the fall if adsnell2004. Sorry for anyone I lied to and fucked over. This is a good city to me. Ill remember that. I dont even know how to steal well or make drugs that seems that us my only option. But I'm clean and that means something. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> I received a couple of job offers recently, and I'm leaning towards the one in Lincoln. I'm from the DC area, so I'm anticipating some changes. I appreciate all the input and insight, thanks. * My friend lives in Omaha, and I'm staying with her initially. I'll check out the apartments (thanks to the posts on the sidebar). I'm curious to know if there are people who do the Omaha-Lincoln commute, or do they just live in Lincoln? * I read a recent post about snow tires. Is it a must? I know it's a silly question. I have a AWD SUV with pretty recent all season tires. I don't mind paying for new tires for the winter season (I'll be moving in January), but I also want to make sure it's an investment (my position may require me to be in Lincoln only be a year or two).  * Another car-related question: My friend in Omaha had hail damage to her car when she first moved there. Would you recommend a covered parking spot in Lincoln? * Hoping to snag some deals during the holiday season for a new wardrobe. I'm used to HUMID summers and okay winters (used to live in Boston, but I wore a ski jacket for the most part). Would a nice long, puffer coat suffice?  Edit: Thank you so much for the responses! Very helpful, and everyone is so kind. Thank you. <eos> \n",

My work is downtown, but I was told to avoid getting housing there for reasons I don't want to mention. What good neighborhoods/rental agencies can I look for? What parts of the city offer a good, stable, quiet living enviornment for someone with a budget of roughly $700/mo for rent. I am most interested in studio apartments, because of their price. Please, any advice you can offer is appreciated. Thanks, guys! <eos> \n",

We like nature, history, good food, and although I can't drink at the moment, craft brews and wines are also of interest. We'd prefer not Hastings since we have family there and we just want to spend the weekend together. We would consider camping but I'd prefer a comfier place to stay since I am 7 months pregnant. I'm looking for suggestions for places to visit, events to look into, lodgings that are inexpensive, etc. We don't have a lot of money to spend but we want to have a relaxing and fun weekend away together before the baby comes. <eos> \n",

I am on medication now, but I only recently started it and need to keep tweaking my dosage until it is correct. Thanks! <eos> \n",

There is usually a big Chelsea/Arsenal/Liverpool following but I myself am an Everton fan. $3 Carlsberg's and Newcastle bottles and an Irish breakfast that is absolutely delicious. So come on down and cheer on your favorite team! P.S. I do not not work for McFarland's.. It's just a lot more fun when there's a lot of people watching the games. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I relocated from Oklahoma City to Lincoln for work about 3 months ago, and, with that, left behind a wonderful group of friends/furry enthusiasts. We used to get together at a friend's house about every 2 weeks or so to hang out and role play or develop our fursonas. My partner (blue husky) and I (grey wolf) attended our first convention (Furry Fiesta in Dallas, TX) this past March and it was a blast. We met so many amazing people. I was actually really surprised by how cool the hotel staff was. My partner and I wouldn't have had to spend money on our room if we'd know we were going to be pawing off and yiffing all night with a few other furverts in their suite, but that's a story for another time. We're also planning (tentatively) to go to: * Central Plains Fur Con in Wichita, KS (September 1-4, 2016) * Furry Migration in Minneapolis, MN (September 9-11, 2016) * Midwest FurFest in Rosemont, IL (December 1-4, 2016) If we end up meeting any other people around here that are interested, they might certainly be able to tag along. That being said, does anyone know of any furry enthusiasts/groups/clubs around Lincoln or Omaha? If not, maybe we could look at starting a group around here. Thanks guys! <eos> \n",

My question is, is it beneficial to do this early sign up? Or would it be better to just wait until it's available? I ask as I'm currently with Spectrum and am ready to switch the moment I can.

I know it's a long\\-shot, but Memorial Stadium isn't being used in the summer, so that's not an issue. The issue would be, where would everybody stay? There's not enough hotels.

My experience with any sort of \"midwestern\" weather is limited to non midwestern states like Idaho and Colorado. Does it just go from comfortable to freezing balls all of a sudden or does it gradually get colder the deeper you get into winter? <eos> \n",

I am going to be hosted by a local, and I would like to go to places that can be experienced in a short amount of time (evening, or afternoon).  Please recommend: A great place to eat (for my host, I want to reciprocate his generosity). An oddball place to \"end up\". Someplace that is uniquely \"Lincoln\", that I won't get anywhere else. An EXCELLENT place to have drinks. Again, something that embodies Lincoln, but is off the radar. Someplace locals know. Help me out? Thanks! <eos> \n",

That, as well as horrendous reviews make me a little leery about purchasing the piece from them. The piece is exactly what we have been looking for and is something we want, but is there anything I should know about this company or their reputation before I make the purchase? It seems to me like their prices are too good to be true.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'm taking my 13 year old daughter and her friend to the TOP show this Thursday. Tickets are GA. Can anyone give me any ideas as to what to expect? What I've been reading is that people get to their outdoor shows as early as 9am to claim spots at the stage (bit ridiculous to me but whatever).  Is repeated entrance and exit from the venue (prior to the show) a mess to deal with? What about seating? I want to give them the best experience possible, obviously, but I do want to know what I'm getting into if I give into their fangirl requests. Any info is appreciated! *Edit. Does anyone know the water situation by chance? We were at the Weezer/Panic! At the Disco show this past Saturday at Stir in CB (b/c I'm an awesome mom. :) ) and water was $4 a bottle but you got a cup and they had water stations around the venue. So, different venue, possibly different set up. Even with \"free\" water, I saw several people pass out. Any ideas in this regard? <eos> \n",

The guy I talked to earlier in the week said we'd probably be able to nab two neighboring lanes on a Friday evening without a reservation anyway. If you can't recognize our group, **I will make sure the employees working the front area will be able to point you in the direction of the meetup.** Parkway has a decent spread when it comes to food (see **[menu]([url link] ~~I couldn't find a beer menu for Parkway, but if their sister location's beer list is any indication, then the selection, while not expansive, should be sufficient. 2-3 dozen labels for bottles, any canned beer you could want, and they may have a handful of choices other than domestics on tap as well.~~ **[Here]([url link] is a beer menu courtesy of /u/Nubraskan. **Please post here** if you plan on making the Friday meetup, including how many you'll be coming with. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> More of a post for R/rants but I am so tired of seeing this. At roughly 0630 I came down Old Cheney and turned onto 14th. I am tired, I work overnights for the state, I want to get to bed. Ahead a red Chevy Tahoe LTZ named SMITTY turns from the West, far lanes it (into my intended lane) and proceeds to do 3 under -in a 45. As I approach, I get the brake lights, and he drops to 32 in a 45. I'm Irritated at this point, there's no reason for this. And then out the window as I pull into the turn lane (passing him in a turn lane, lol right?) I hear \"Fucking bitch!\" To the point over my anecdote: your drivers here suck. Not only do they not signal, pull far lane at the inconvenience of others, and in general not obey common courtesy like the speed limit, they think they're RIGHT. I've almost been hit by no less than 4 high school girls because they were on their phones and almost merged into MY lane, followed by stings of curses for \"not letting them in\". Read. Your fucking. Book. You had to when you got your license, I did too. Many of you clearly need to re-read it before you wind up owing someone a new Mercedes or BMW. Blinkers. Fucking use them, they're a standard feature for a reason. /Rant <eos> \n",

Basically, you'd be required to come sit (fully clothed) in a comfy chair in my studio and read a book/listen to Ipod/whatever while I paint you. Sittings would last about 30 minutes to an hour. I can pay, but not much: 20 bucks an hour. I'll post some examples of my work here in a few minutes. If anyone has questions, post them here. If anyone is interested, send me a message. **Edit:** If I don't respond to your comment, I'll PM you in the near future. Thanks so much for the unexpected response. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Most distressing and bewildering experience today at the DMV (that's Dept. of Motor Vehicles for those not up on acronyms.) I recently resurrected/repaired a motorcycle I bought years ago with the intent of learning to ride, actually re-learn since I had learned once back in the 1970's on a bike similar to this one.  I approached the examiner when I was called, and explained that I wanted to sit for the written motorcycle exam. He proceeded to tell me that I needed two forms of address verifying identification (me thinks huh? OK...) so I'm digging around in my wallet trying to find my car registration when he looks at my drivers license and says \"I can't accept that as a valid ID.\" I look at him and say \"But this is a valid state of Nebraska drivers license issued in 2012\", he tells me that he will check. Tap, tap, tap, \"No, I can't accept that as valid ID, it doesn't have the little gold star in the corner\", he says. \"Gold star?\" I ask, now piqued that my entirely valid and in-force drivers license is somehow inadequate to identify me. \"But this ID was issued by your department identifying me, it doesn't expire until 2017!\" I finally exclaim to the poor hamstrung examiner. \"Per a 2009 law, we require you to prove your identity and residence address to obtain an ID\" the examiner tells me. I, look at my now (questionably valid?) drivers license again, seeing that it was issued in 2012, and again iterate \"but, the DMV issued me this in 2012...\" my voice now drifting off as my mind ponders this Kafkaesque scene playing out. The smiling examiner is now proffering a sheet containing a bullet list of those things which qualify as proof. By this time my demeanor had changed from optimism to complete disillusionment and I don't think I uttered another word as I shuffled away in total bewilderment. Gotta love bureaucrats, they're gonna implement the hell out of a law, regardless. Sorry to offend, I'm trying to see some bright side to this otherwise discouraging incident. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Is there a lot of free street parking available in Lincoln? I'm moving there in a month (already have an apartment lined up) and I'm trying to figure out if I need to actually pay for parking (my apartment building has both a lot and underground garage for 65/mo). Also, my SO will be coming to visit periodically, and I was wondering how difficult it will be to find on street parking (can you park overnight on the street?). Sorry if these are silly questions, I am coming from Milwaukee and figuring out parking here was a trick and a half when I first came. Now I've got three different parking permits just to park on the street outside my front door. :/ Hoping Lincoln will be easier. Thanks!! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello everyone!  So as I told you all in the February Meetup followup post our next meetup is going to be in April. *Side Note: If anyone wants to have an impromtu meetup this month feel free to do so! I can't host/organize this month but I encourage anyone who may want to get together to do so.* So the two big questions to focus on: **When?** In the past I've put up dates for people to vote on but I'd really like it if you guys just looked at your calendar and put out a general idea of what days and times work for you. Weekdays? Weekends? afternoon evening? What do you prefer?  **Where?** My knowledge of Lincoln is still rather limited, I've been selecting potential meetup locations based on what I've known downtown. It's occurred to me there might be other locations local redditors might prefer. April weather should be more suitable, if not a bit brisk, for a possible meetup outdoors. There's also a few places that have weekly Karaoke that might provide some entertainment for those attending. Or possibly a trivia night somewhere.  Let us know what you want to do, or what events you know about! **The Process** A week from today I'll put together whatever information we have and come up with a couple options to be voted on by the community and post another thread. The voting on that thread will be brief so we can announce the results so people can plan ahead! Thank you everyone for your input!    <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello r/Lincoln. I need some advice. I found out my car needs a new engine in it. It is not worth it to repair it and it is now currently just chilling at the auto shop. I really just want to take it to the junk yard because that would be the easiest and quickest way to get rid of it. The tires would be the only thing I would want to salvage from the car. But what junk yards would you guys recommend or are there any other options I could do?? The car is a 99 Taurus just FYI.  Cheers <eos> \n",
            "<bos> PSA for any other parents of little kids here. I just discovered The Front Porch. It’s a coffee shop with a play area inside of Cross the Line church at 60th and Adams. It’s open 7-6 and has a big comfortable room with not-expensive coffee and drinks and snacks for kids. It also has a separate (free) play room with a big climbing structure and several plastic little tikes climbers. It is like a smaller version of the sorely missed Ager play Center. It has a gymnasium but that has limited hours: 2-4 pm. It also has an outdoor playground but we didn’t check it out. Overall it’s much cheaper than Lost in Fun or Champions Fun Center but seems suited for littler kids than those.  I don’t go to this church (or any church) but I think this place is fairly new. I certainly hadn’t heard of it and thought I’d pass it on to any other parents stuck at home with kids this winter.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> So *apparently* I signed up for a class in the Plant Science building at 6 on Tuesdays. I'm a grad student so usually just have classes in Arch Hall, so I don't know anything about East Campus. Are there meters or anything close to Plant Science?

My coworkers and I thought that a fake pete ricketts twitter acct with his face photoshopped onto \"Mini Me\" from Austin Powers would be pretty good.

            "<bos> I'm wondering if anyone on /r/lincoln has used megabus to travel anywhere. I'd like to know a little bit about the experience. I'm thinking about going to Des Moines from Omaha so it's not a long journey but I'm hoping to hear that megabus is a bearable way to travel. Please let me know if you have traveled somewhere on megabus because I don't have a car and I'm trying to go to Iowa. Thanks. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> In this thread, we can vote on the location of the Friday, May 17th meetup, to be held the evening of... **Friday, May 17th**. As usual, meeting time is **TBD**, and will depend on the winning venue's hours. Anyone can vote. No votes are allowed \"against\" a place - only for. You can only vote for one location. **Vote by simply replying in this thread** and *explicitly* stating your selection (ex.: *\"Obviously X is going to win, I'll be there!\"* is merely an assumption, and wouldn't count as a vote should X be overtaken. Simply stating the name of the place is sufficient, but any amount of other text is fine as long as the intention of voting is made clear.) That said, here are our named contenders for May: * **Tico's** (17th  'L') * **Macaroni Grill** (27th  Pine Lake) * **FireWorks** (84th  Old Cheney) * **Mongolian Grill** (66th  'O') As always, you can alternatively cast a vote for anywhere which isn't one of the above four choices. If your pick doesn't win and is a sufficiently viable location, it may well be a named choice in the next voting round. This month's list contains no repeats from the previous named list, but does include a location that got a vote in last month's comments. Most meetups eventually carry on to a second location in the vicinity of the first. Second locations are usually decided in a less formal manner - by suggestion in the reminder thread posted the week of the meetup, or at the meetup itself if there are several apparent options. Voting will conclude Wednesday night, May 8th at 11:59pm. At that point, all responses will be tallied and the winner will be determined. An RSVP/411 thread will be created the week of the meetup to gauge attendance and provide additional information for anyone showing up. ***Please reply with your vote!*** <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Just curious what everyone likes to do after the food portion of the date. You can only putt-putt, movie, and paintyourselfsilly so many times. If I have a longer lunch date and downtown we may just wander around the little shops. Just curious what I am missing out on! <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Having just recently moved to Nebraska, I'm ill informed on where to buy my groceries. My first priority is meat. So far, I've only purchased meat from the Hy-Vee off Old Cheney and 40th and, while it wasn't bad, their selection was a little disappointing and I've never been impressed with Hy-Vee steaks. I'm not looking for top of the line steak, but I would buy most of my meat from Fareway, in Iowa, and I'd like something on par with that. Are any of the other local chains better in the meat department or are there any butchers with good values? I'm also fairly excited to have new foods available to me. Asian and Middle-eastern markets are not something I've ever had access to. Any suggestions for good ethnic markets with minimal cringe factor for my 'picky' girlfriend. (She's thought most the places we've driven by looked shady and wouldn't go in.) Thanks in advance, /r/Lincoln. <eos> \n",

List the local restaurants you have never been to, but **want to try!** I'll start:  * Issara * Blue Orchid * Pies  Pints * African Restaurant * Pho Factory * Kinja * Fuji Sushi * Mr. Hui's * Annie's Sunshine Cafe * Tina's Cafe * Cobbler Cafe * Cornerstone Pizza (should it open) Recently knocked BrixStone off the list. A tad pricy (especially with a couple beers), but worth it. Also checked out Firehouse  Jersey Mike's, though both of those are chains. <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Hello,  Not going to name the establishment, but last night prior to the Pink! my GF and a friend went and had a drink in the Haymarket. Both my GF and friend had three drinks and don’t remember anything after that. This is highly unusual for them as both can handle their liquor. Both became sick and unable to attend the concert. Luckily both made it home safe. Thanks Lyft! A mutual friend saw them and commented that they didn’t appear drunk but drugged. My GF remembers almost nothing. In ten plus years of dating I’ve never seen her the way act the way she did after arriving home. Not a typical drunken evening in my exp robes but perhaps others experienced something similar.   <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hello, Lincoln. I have a cousin. A cousin who, in the past, has made some horrible and awful decisions. However, I, and the rest of my family, still love him to bits. We want him to know that we'll be there for him and love him.  He got in touch with my Father and his brothers a year or so ago and they all met and I got to talk to him on the phone for the first time in something like 5/6 years. However, within the next coming weeks his phone line was disconnected, and I'm fairly certain his parents had something to do with it. Our family is having some very terrible problems with his parents, and they keep him from us because they're embarrassed? I'm not sure. He made awful choices and most people wouldn't want to associate with him, but that's not how it works with my family. His name is Justin Olson. He's over 6 foot tall with blonde hair, in his late twenties/early thirties but he's always looked younger. I don't know anymore, though, I haven't seen him for 9 years. Is there *any way* I can find him? Myself and my sister/cousins have looked for him before and don't even know where to start. He's not on social media, and his parents have things in their names so we can't find anything out about him. He could be dead and nobody would know. Any advice? Are there people we could call? Should we just give up? I don't know... it's just sad.  <eos> \n",

            "<bos> So here's me, walking back to my car in the North Bottoms from class, when I reach into my backpack looking for my headphones and find something unexpected...a tiny joint that I had rolled the night before and never smoked. I proceed to grab it out of my bag, glance around, light it, and continue the walk back to my car in one stealth maneuver, never breaking my initial stride. Mind you at this point I'm between the stadium and the new practice facility walking through that parking lot to the bridge. I'm about to take one more hit of this thing and ditch it as sneakily as I sparked it, when something catches the corner of my eye, just to my right. It's Tom Osborne getting out of his car right fucking next to me. I mean, his car door almost hit me when he opened it while I had a lit spliff in my hand, merely feet from his royal nostrils! He looked straight in my shody eyes, and quitely said \"oh, excuse me.\" With a total deer-in-the-headlights look, I said nothing and kept on walking.  <eos> \n",

I'm on mobile but I'm sharing the most I can with everyone in the Lincoln area (where he is from). I was recently asked to share this message to anyone I may have connections with in Lincoln, so I thought to come to you guys.  Please help get the message across and help find Jack Carey, who went missing recently.  Here are some links to a picture of their Facebook post and some pictures of Jack: [Facebook post]([url link] Pictures:  [Picture #1]([url link] [Picture #2]([url link] [Picture #3]([url link] EDIT: Whoops I made the account with the name of his brother (the one I personally knew) so whoops.

Sincerely thank you all for all the offers of help and suggestions, really made this whole trip 1000x better, you'll are the nicest city I've had the pleasure of being in :) I'll try and take this heatwave back to Texas with me, it's been interesting!

Hi guys, long story short I'm currently stranded here around the Walmart on Superior for the next day or two until I can get my VanRv fixed and have a couple of questions Is there anything near here I could do to stay out of the heat? I'm thinking about going to VS arcade bar later but until then im unsure of what to do, also anything else over there I should check out? I've got a few repair shops in mind thanks to Google but I would love some recommendations that are close to said Walmart Lastly anywhere I should avoid for safety reasons? I'm mainly going to Lyft around if I go to the bar and such but I like to know what I'm getting into  Thanks :) so far you guys are pretty friendly, not the worst place to be stranded! <eos> \n",

The class is based on the development process and the architect's POV, but I'd also really like to know how the user's experience matches the architect's vision. If I can ask you a couple of questions about living in Parkhaus and cite you in my paper it would be great. PM me or leave a comment if you can help! Thanks. <eos> \n",

I've lived and driven in at least 4 other major cities that get similar amounts of snow, and none of them just leave their residential streets to become packed down ice slicks. Does anyone else agree? Would anyone else be willing to write to city council members or the mayor or the Department of Public Works and voice concern about the streets?

We do events throughout the year ( [Wine festival]([url link] Oktoberfest, Free Santa visit, free Easter egg hunt, etc) for the sole purpose of bringing the community together and supporting small businesses from here in Lincoln and NE.

The problem is with just immediate family we have 25 people (10 are kids) and with friends we are up to ~35. We are guessing only about 25 total will end up coming (hopefully). The problem is we don't know where to have the party (as we live in a small apartment). We don't have a lot of money so we are needing as cheap as possible, like as close to under $100 as we can. Any ideas on where to have it that will be cheap and feasible for that many people but also appropriate for a two year olds birthday?  <eos> \n",

We'll have a number of games available, generally there are always lighter games available to drop into like [Cat Lady]([url link] or [Dominion]([url link] but people will also plan out heavier games in advance on our [Discord server]([url link] Currently, we have a meetup **every Wednesday at The Mill @ Telegraph**. We've been meeting there for most of this year and it's been great, lots of space and options for drinks. They've also recently added some more options for food, I haven't tried them but I did see some pretty good looking snacks available. They're kind enough to reserve some tables for us each week, especially with UNL classes wrapped up we shouldn't have any issues with space. Many of us are on the [Lincoln Discord Server]([url link] if you want to talk with us more or round people up for a game ahead of time. I'm usually free to help with teaching new games, just let me know in advance if you'd like some help so I can brush up on the rules and make sure I don't already have something planned. Also consider joining our [Facebook Group]([url link] or check out our [BGG Guild]([url link] to see some of the game options available. If something on that list catches your eye hop on Discord and ask and we can try to plan a game. **Wednesday 6/6 6pm - The Mill @ Telegraph** **330 S 21st St**  ________________________________________________________ #New shop opening Sparta Games is opening up their bar and grill next week, next Friday evening! I'm excited to see it, they'll have games available there to play but you can also bring in your own, it'll be a good space to play. If you're on Facebook, check out the event [here]([url link] I'm really hoping this place works out, it'll be great to have a collection available to test games from.  <eos> \n",

If you know of a way I can do it on my own that would not blow out my back/ pride let me know too please.

The next /r/lincoln meetup will be held **Friday, February 15th at 8pm**. The location of that meetup will be determined by your votes in this thread. There are four places \"on the ballot\" - all of which have in common a diverse selection of food *and* a wel-stocked bar; qualities which tend to line up well with those attending meetups. And of course, all of the options are open to all ages as well. Here are the candidates:  * **Granite City (near Gateway Mall)** * **Lazlo's (Haymarket location)** * **Grandmothers (70th  'A')** * **Old Chicago (Southpointe location)** Each person is allowed *one* vote -- any votes for more than one location will be discarded, and any tampering will be discarded. Vote by replying to this thread and naming your choice. Upvoting someone who has voted for one of the choices *does not* count as a vote; **you must reply to this thread with your choice for your vote to be counted.** You can also vote for anywhere which isn't one of these four choices, by simply naming it instead of one of the options listed above. If that location achieves majority, the meetup will be held there. If that location achieves reasonable support, it will be included as a candidate in future meetup voting rounds. Voting will terminate January 31st at 11:59pm; all responses will then be tallied and the winner will be determined. ***Please reply with your vote!*** <eos> \n",

I've looked around and I noticed the Canopy Lofts look nice and they seem to be in a great location. It's very close to the University though so I'm worried it would be full of college kids. Anyone live there or know about that part of town? Also considering the Summit Falls Apartments.  In short, I'm looking for a 1 bedroom apartment with garage parking for about $1k a month and I'm wondering if there are parts of Lincoln I should avoid if I don't want to have terrible neighbors?

I have a little 3 year old and what they said makes sense about full eye coverage. Went to Praxair off Cornhusker hwy and they're the ones that had the $10 goggles. The guy there said he has about 20 pair left and they're going fast if anyone else is interested. Thanks for all the replies everyone! ##Edit 2 (important): Again, thanks guys for the replies. I'm sure this is helping lots of other people besides me. But just a word to the wise; make sure you are getting *genuine* solar eclipse glasses. In my search I've come across articles that say China and other places are pumping out fakes that are basically really dark sunglasses. They'll look exactly like official ones because they are exact copies (same cardboard design and ISO certification printed on them).  ##Please make sure you get them from a reputable dealer and not something that comes directly from mainland China. If in doubt get #14 welding goggles, I've been staring at the sun all day with my new pair and trying to teach my toddler how to do it before the actual event. <eos> \n",

On average, we'll have somewhere between 10-15 people show up (and we're growing!). We have multiple types of games; social games with easy rules and lots of interaction or more competitive games as well as cooperative ones. [Tabletop]([url link] on youtube is a good place to get a feel for the types of games we usually play. Currently, we have a meetup **every Wednesday at the Cottonwood Cafe**. It's a great spot for board gaming due to its big tables, good food/drinks, and central location. We also might have different meetups throughout the week outside of Cottonwood, depending on what people wanna do. Many of us are on the [Lincoln Discord Server]([url link] if you wanna talk with us more. Also consider joining our [Facebook Group]([url link] **Wednesday 12/6 6:30pm - Cottonwood Cafe 440 S 11th St** <eos> \n",

Hole in the wall on 11th and Highway 2. Wanted something new, away from the college bars downtown. Clean place, kinda neat atmosphere but some guy named \"[removed]\" or something literally grabbed the beers out of our hands, drank them in front of us, then asked \"whose bitch ass head do I break this over first?\" This all happened in about 2 minutes after getting there.

It would be really nice if my wife would get this position as we are STRUGGLING on my one income.   I'm lost on what to do, does anyone know of a daycare that would allow me to drop off the kids at 630-645 and they would make sure they get to school? I only need help in the mornings.

National weather is reporting 8-12 (on their website, but I don't know when that was updated) Omaha.com is reporting 6-12 inches. Lady at hair cut place said 16 inches. Cashier at HyVee said 3-20 inches. I responded that the temperature will be somewhere between -10 and 100 degrees. I was told that a national weather person who follows big storms tweeted that he will be in Lincoln or Omaha this Thursday... They also said that we will keep getting hit with snow every 4-5 days for a while. What happened to the groundhog not seeing his shadow? I am starting to have my doubts about that guy. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> On Sunday, January 19th, my company (R. Michael Industries) along with Venue Restaurant  Lounge will be hosting a [brunch and art show.]([url link] The full brunch buffet will start at 11:30am and run until 1:00pm and each ticket comes with a steel snowflake from our 2013 collection. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the American Cancer Society and Dayna's Dream Big Scholarship, which is a local scholarship fund in honor of a recently passed teacher from LPS. Along with the food and snowflake, my company will also be displaying a variety of sculptures and some new lighting products that we are releasing this spring. As someone who recently had a cancer scare (tests came back benign, thankfully) and who has experienced friends and family battle the disease it would mean a lot to have Reddit help support this event. Hope to see some of you other redditors there! <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Well, the previous meetup was quite a success. We had about 20 people show up for an extremely hazy -- perhaps bordering on belligerent -- downtown adventure. Predictably, there was even a *sub*-subreddit meetup I know nothing about, which occurred because a smaller group formed and never located the greater meetup group. (For all I know, there was even a larger meetup with about 100 people happening that same night, and I was only part of the middle-sized group.) But I digress; now it is time to look to the future! Come one, come all to the Reddit meetup, Madsen's edition. **Friday, 31 August 2012, from 8pm onward, join us at Madsen's Bowling  Billiards, 48th  Dudley.** Madsen's should have something for everyone, so even if you suck at bowling (like me), there's plenty else to do... I do still plan to bowl at least a round though. Madsen's has bowling, billiards, a spacious lounge area, bar food (their site's down, but [here's]([url link] an archived copy of the menu), a beer patio, pickle cards, and I think one of those machines where you can pick the song that you won't even be able to hear in return for your first born. Overall this should be a bit easier on the pockets, as pitchers aren't $15-20 as we encountered at Yia Yia's. Realistically though, you'll probably spend the same amount, but get a lot more sensory saturation. Let the comments roar. <eos> \n",

I already have two cats (who aren't happy with the kitten being here) and don't have the money to get the kitten up to code, so to speak. I tried to give him to the Humane Society this afternoon, and they wouldn't take him without crazy cat lady's contact info. I'm going to try taking him to The Cat House tomorrow, but, does anyone know of any other resources in Lincoln that might be useful? TL;DR Anyone want a free kitten?

One example that comes to my mind is a metal art piece on UNL campus that one can stand inside, basically two tall curved metal walls, and the acoustics in there are real neat. Looking for stuff like that. Thanks a lot now! <eos> \n",

The description of the keys is as follows: a black Ford truck key, a rectangular three button fob, a set (3) house keys, and a red bottle opener (all on the same key ring). If you have even seen them laying on the ground downtown please PM me! Any clues are welcome. If I can't find these keys I'm looking at spending over $300 to replace them :( <eos> \n",

However, I feel like he made it worse and I don't want to make him feel bad by asking him to do it over again.  Are there any fairly modestly priced mechanics around Lincoln that would work on struts etc? I've been to Tam's (22ND-ish and S-ish) before but would rather not go back to him if at all possible. Thanks! <eos> \n",

We're booked at Duffy's Tavern on April 13th, before we head back to Denver. We're touring following the release of our second album, I'll leave a link to our previous release if anyone here has any suggestions. Thanks so much!  [Flaual - Thin King]([url link] <eos> \n",

I unplug the router and modem, let it sit for a few seconds, plug it back in and it usually work. At least for a little while before crashing again.

I have an absurdly small mouth to the point they would have to break my jaw to even get braces on... So!  I'm pretty scared of this D: especially considering I am otherwise unemployed and broke as fuck, is there anyone who can suggest good deals on this?  <eos> \n",

Have gone to the zoo a few times, the Omaha zoo is great with the aquarium and everything but not as much stuff for a kid so young here at the lincoln zoo plus it's getting cold out.  What places or activities do you recommend? I know there is a children's museum but from the website I couldn't really tell what it's like or what they offer. My son is only 15 months old so I don't want to show up to something geared towards way older kids. <eos> \n",

This is a FREE SHOW that runs 10 weeks from June 1 - August 3. The event is held at Railside plaza downtown, doors open at 6, bands go from 7-11pm. There are usually 3 bands and a DJ.  Right now we are accepting applications for bands, singer-songwriters and DJs to come and play. This is a pay gig and you are of course allowed to sell merch. It's a pretty great opportunity to get your music out of Lincoln and Omaha and in front of an eager Mid-NE crowd. Application link: [url link] There are also food trucks and a beer garden as well as the occasional event for community participation (like a group art project for example). Most people bring their lawn chairs but some stand in front of the bands or dance. In past years this was organized by Hear Nebraska. This year with Hear Nebraska transitioning to non-profit Rabble Mill they have handed the booking and promotion over to the GI organizers (including myself). We've booked bands in the past that play \"mostly original\" music but are opening it up a bit this year to bands that do covers and might even have a couple tribute bands on the bill.  The application is staying open another week and then we will be sorting through the bands and booking. Share the link below with any bands that you think might be interested in coming to play! Thanks for checking this out, PM me if you have any questions or would like more information! Facebook: [url link] Instagram: [url link] Twitter: [url link] ---------- Also, as I mentioned it is unrelated to us but Rabble Mill (former Hear Nebraska) is also looking for bands to come play the awesome Good Living Tour across the state this summer.

I'm trying to avoid restaurants and movie theatres as those are a bit cliché and boring. I was thinking maybe the sunken gardens would be a good place to go but I didn't know if the flowers would be in bloom this time of the year. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Also, as an aside, if you guys could tell me some good first date conversations starters that would be great. This will be my *first* first date, so I'm quite nervous and am generally not that great at making entertaining conversation. Thanks! <eos> \n",

I've never seen anybody parked there or anything, just the enormous building with arched doors and windows and exterior lights. It also looks like it has a warehouse type building behind it. Anybody know it's origin? <eos> \n",

Survey is here [url link] My opinion is there needs to be more in the Haymarket besides restaurants. Some business that will get people there such as retail, a pharmacy, a bank, or grocery stores. Make it a neighborhood as well as an entertainment district.  Thoughts? <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I got married last Thursday and went to 9 South Chargrill for dinner after our very small ceremony. We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate. We found out after dinner when we got our check that a very nice couple sitting at a table next to us bought the bottle for us! By that time the couple had already left so unfortunately we never got a chance to thank them. I know it is highly unlikely that they reddit, and even more unlikely that they subscribe to this subreddit, but if anyone happens to have heard that their friends did this let them know we greatly appreciate it and it is great to know there are people out there that would do something like that for perfect strangers, and to have the waitress not tell us until after they left makes it a truly selfless act. Thank you kind strangers, thank you very much. <eos> \n",

Um I asked someone what bank they use since I am looking for one (I had one but the account closed when I didn't have work for a while... I am able to open one now.)  They suggested a credit union, which is awesome, but it's really far from my house. (I cant drive so... yah) I was wondering if there are any I can use that are closer. I live in the area south of Van Dorn near Highway 2 if that helps.  <eos> \n",

Not the kind i've seen in groceries around where they're tiny, not sweet, and kinda mushy. I mean large  sweet with a snap to them.

Police report said something along lines that it was \"plausible\" that it was confusing due to spacing of cones. Also I saw an article about it on msn.com. Made national news.

            "<bos> Anybody else notice this? I think they changed it due to that teen's car crash a while back but lately Cronhusker, at least east of 27th, has been an absolute hassle if you want to turn left. Every time there's a ten minute wait at a red light that then proceeds to immediately turn yellow after turning green letting only two cars through, three if someone runs it. So you usually end up having to wait through two or three traffic cycles (reds and greens for every one) before you can finally go. It's becoming a traffic nightmare! I know this isn't the only location with the new red arrows, but damn it's the worst I've found. Who do I talk to to help get this fixed? Edit: word choice: used a word twice redundantly  <eos> \n",

I've seen the other apartment threads but am wondering about how up to date they are. I would ideally like to live in a pretty good area with good landlords so I don't have headaches because I live in a tough area of New York now and would not want to experience that again. I am a grad student, so the budget is tight, but I am open to any suggestions.  <eos> \n",

As many of you know, we have been busy fulfilling Christmas wishes for our adopted seniors and we've hit a road block. One of them would like a copy of the book Citizens edited by John Ringo  Brian Thompson but we can't find it!   It's an older Science Fiction anthology, and we've searched all the new  used book stores in Lincoln and the surrounding area, and exhausted our options for ordering it online. We need to have it by tomorrow, and would gladly pay for it if ANYONE out there knows where we could get one, or has a used copy they'd be willing to sell. Pass it along to your friends.

            "<bos> Hey all. First post here. Don't murder me.  Keto has blown up in the past two years. More and more people are getting on the low carb or keto lifestyle. At the same time it is hard to eat anywhere that has anything close to keto friendly options. You're either buying an entire pizza and eating only the toppings, eating a salad, or getting wings of some sort, and getting it custom ordered so they go easy on the sauce. That is if they remember not to add any.  Who would be interested in a restaurant/to go spot that serves keto/low carb food as its core business? I am throwing around the idea in different spots to guage an audience.  Any thoughts? Edit: I would love to hear WHY you think its a good or bad idea. The more detailed thought the better, it really helps. Thanks guys, so far this has been great! <eos> \n",

I will not consider rehoming my dog, ever. She is well behaved and my best friend. Can someone point me in the right direction of an understanding landlord? If I get a choice, I'd like to live on the south/near south side of town, and have the ability to rent a garage if not already included. But really, an affordable price and I'll live anywhere in town if I can have my dog. Thanks! :) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> I'll be moving there most likely sometime in early August. I'll be coming from Virginia/Maryland, and won't be able to really visit. I am going to be visiting in mid May to check out UNL/the city/housing possibilities.  So! In terms of housing, I've been looking on craigslist. I have a few that I'm looking at, but haven't contacted anyone yet. I'm looking for a 1-2 bedroom since it's most likely just going to be me, and I do NOT want student housing. Are there any complexes worth looking at, or any I should avoid? Are there any other decent sites I should be looking at for options? Also, while I'm pretty sure I have a general idea on how much rent should be, how much are utilities typically? I don't need cable, but I definitely need Internet. Furnished would be helpful, but not required and I don't expect it. How does the bus system work? I believe I read that UNL students can ride the buses for free, is that correct? Also, I know there are routes between the campuses, but where can I find where else the buses go in the city? This has been a huge factor when I've looked at housing, since I've been doing it based on how far they are from the campus. I plan on viewing these places when I visit.  Employment.... While I'm an alternate as a TA and the department has given me a lead on a well paying job, I obviously don't want to bank on either of those. I'll have a BS in Geographic Science and have extensive GIS skills, but I haven't seen much in terms of employment in that department in Lincoln. It's also difficult since I have no idea what my schedule will be. I'm just looking for something that I'll be able to pay my bills with, at the very least.  Any tips here would be appreciated... I have tons of questions, since I'm moving across the country in excess of 1200 miles, but these are the main things.  Edit: I think I'm going to look for a 2-3 bedroom and try to find a roommate or two to reduce costs :P  <eos> \n",

We are going for more of a hangout spot and less of a traditional bar, we would have plush reading chairs as well has tables and chairs.  Do you think Lincoln needs this type of establishment?

I called in and of course knew more then the person answering the phone... So i am going to crowd source this information.

A company logo is like a tattoo, best done well and with a personal touch as it could be a lifetime decision.  Back in the day I would have gone to Craigslist, but after a long absence I found that looking there for gig advertising was likely not going to have the desired result given Craigslist spiraling into a personals forum.  Where can I advertise to find the young artists in town? <eos> \n",

But I visit Omaha fairly often, and I am having trouble finding buses or other means of transportation (which depart at reasonable hours) that will take me there. The only one I have found so far leaves sometime after midnight.  Many people commute from Lincoln to Omaha and vice versa, so surely there must be some reliable means of public transportation? If you know of anything, I would greatly appreciate your help. <eos> \n",

There is no toilet paper in this stall or the neighboring stall, I am wondering if someone might be able to make a delivery tonight. I apologize for the short notice, but I am basically immobile as I have a crappy ass and nothing to wipe it on. Normally I check if there's TP beforehand but it was kind of an emergency.

            "<bos> As I'm getting older, and a bit tamer in my ways, my partner and some friends are looking for a public place to celebrate New Years. Gone are the days of stumbling from downtown bar to downtown bar. And honestly, the idea of paying a ridiculous cover to listen to an extremely loud band in an overcrowded bar has lost its appeal. Sadly, I am old, but I would still like to do something nice for New Years, and hear the people I'm sitting with (even if I have to turn up my hearing aids really high). And suggestions on mellowed lounges or fun restaurants that can help myself and a few friends ring in the new year? (I'm not really old, I'm 30, but darn it I'm embracing my inner old) <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Following up a previous post about the trick or treating for kids. I figured I'd start a list of places for exactly that.  Trunk or Treats, are where usually churches will set up stations in their parking lot, and kids with their parents (usually, depending on the age of the kid). It's a fun, safe way for Halloween joy. I encourage anyone who sees or knows about the Trunk or Treat events to post the address, dates and times below. Would be appreciated. Doesn't have to be churches, could be the mall events, store events, etc. just helping trying to help parents out.  * Horizons Community Church, 3200 Granger Parkway, Lincoln * Friday Oct 28th 6:30-8:00 * Horizonschurch.org  <eos> \n",

I'd happily back this guy up in a knife fight but the thing is, he's too cool for violence and would stop a knife fight from happening and have the nere do Wells buying him buorbon.

I tried calling the Humane Society but they were closed. I even call the non-emergency dispatch number to see if they had any reports. Nothing. After driving around and crying my eyes out like a little bitch, I found him 3 miles away chilling with some old dude in his garage. He gave my dog food, water and played with him. You sir are the real MVP. <eos> \n",

Figured it would have to be out door patios.  <eos> \n",

Everything from biking to recycling, composting to solar panels, and of course supporting people and businesses who care not only about the community but about the future of our world. I was hoping YOU, /r/Lincoln, can help me begin to learn. Just how Green is Lincoln? What are the people like? Is it as conservative as I heard, or is there some progressiveness going on? On my visit, what can I look for to support the green initiative?  EDIT: Thanks for the responses! They were so helpful that I made [another post.]([url link] <eos> \n",

The only options available at the zip code (68528) seem to be TWC, Windstream, and Internet Nebraska. Of my experience, I have had terrible product and customer service experience with Windstream in the past. TWC looks to have very little confidence in their product although is the cheapest and has best options for faster speeds. I have never heard of Internet Nebraska. Since I do not have the options of Verizon FiOS or Cox like other areas, what has been your experience in Lincoln and who should I go with. For the record, I also don't want either of their modem/routers since I have a $200 one of my own. <eos> \n",

Normal and S 70th Street intersect on the corner of the park for those who may not have been there before. No dates were specifically mentioned but I know in the past everyone has wanted them on weekends. So I chose a Sunday evening hoping that will work for people.  I've looked the park up on google maps and found a spot that looks good [here]([url link] There's some trees, a large parking lot and a what appear to be a sand volleyball pit. If anyone knows of a better location I'm certainly willing to take suggestions. Hope to see you all there!

            "<bos> Thinking of moving to LNK from OMA to avoid the commute. If you have Allo, would you mind reviewing it and posting a speed test screenshot? If i get the \"up to 1 gig\" how far there does it actually get? Any issues with them either technically or on a policy basis? We have teen kids and they tend to 'find' TV shows via our Amazon Firestick - shows which shouldn't be on it somehow. Anyway, just curious if that would trigger any alarms.  For the screen shot, just google \"speed test\" and try one of the popular ones.  Thanks in advance! <eos> \n",

Based on my job searching for Lincoln (not looking to get a job right now, just gauging) it doesn't seem like there is much in Lincoln for IT which is pretty discouraging. I am looking in the Business Analyst/Systems Analyst roles.  I guess I'm just trying to guage how hard it will be for me to get a good paying IT job in Lincoln within the next 2 year or so. I'd hate to commute to Omaha every day. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> My car was rear-ended while waiting to turn today. As it was an older car that I have used extensively throughout the years, I only had \"liability\" insurance at the time of the accident, so I have no way of getting funds from insurance for a new car even though someone was great enough to follow the guy and get his plate number and the location of where he abandoned the truck. My car still runs, but the repairs will be too costly to be interested in fixing--the whole back bumper and trunk are caved in and the back window is shattered. Has anyone been in a car situation like this? I've been told to either sell it for scrap by weight, or sell it somewhere that takes damaged cars--I just purchased four new tires back in October, and my car was in good shape otherwise, so I would like to get as much out of this as possible, given the shitty situation and having no prior experience in anything like this. Is there a place in town that offers this selling option? Thanks in advance for any help you can give me. <eos> \n",

I’m a late 20s female in search of some girl friends in the area. I’m in a long distance relationship and I don’t have kids (but it’s totally fine if you do!) Some activities I like doing are hiking, wandering the farmers market, antiquing/thrifting, trying new workout classes, etc., I’m kind of open to whatever since I’m still getting to know the town. Please feel free to message me if you want to know more. Thanks for reading and hope to meet you soon!  <eos> \n",

Parkway Lanes has touted the best burger for decades, and I would agree it is a great burger. Two new-comers are quite tasty as well: Greta's Gourmet Butcher Shop and \"The Eatery\" both have outstanding burgers. The best value burger (IMHO) would be at Ramo's on Wednesday evenings. 1/2 lb burger and fries for $3.99.  <eos> \n",

Are there any interesting shops or activities in town concerning comic books, video games, or anything like that? <eos> \n",

Most people didn't have a lot of input on the dates and the votes for the 18th and the 25th were evenly split, so I'm just going to pick the 25th to give people more time to take off work/make arrangements as necessary so hopefully we'll have another great turnout.  I'll post another RSVP thread a week before to get an idea of how many people will be showing up so I can reserve enough spots in advance! Thank you for all your input, I'm looking forward to seeing you all again! **TL;DR - January 25th @730 at Old Chicago then Starlight Lounge ~9pm? Mark your Calendars!** <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Like the title says, new Costco opening soon. Is anyone else psyched? I hoping for a few things from it. 1. Gas prices will drop across town as a result of competitive pricing. Costco usually has the cheapest gas, or at the very least matches the lowest. We have room to drop vs Omaha. 2. Cheaper prescriptions, Costco often has some of the best prices in town, and as far as I'm aware you DO NOT need a membership for it. Also flu shots and stuff.  3. Free samples!!! Anyone up for lunch runs!? :D They don't limit the number of samples u can have. Consider it a perk of membership. lol 4. Some costcos have special one-time only items to celebrate new store openings. One costco I went to had $1200 Canada Goose parkas for only $400. I got one of course. I was a bit late to the La Vista one but I did notice they had some Omen X computers but unfortunately the whole line is overpriced to begin with. <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Hey all. My girlfriend lives in Lincoln, and she moved into town relatively recently (she's only been in 7 months). Most of her friends from high school stayed in their home town, and she's been quite lonely. I live in Omaha (for now, planning to move in with her in a few months), so whenever I'm not visiting, she's basically by herself all day. So I was wondering where two college-aged young adults could go out and make some new friends? Websites, social events, even you folks on the sub. I'm looking for advice for the most part, since I only have my friends from high school, and I wouldn't know how to go out and make new ones. We're currently trying OKCupid, but obviously that's more meant for dating than it is friendship. So, any ideas? <eos> \n",

I took my last check and left and bought a super cheap car and traveling the country. I am finding odd jobs throughout the way, and got something really crappy but 1000% helpful to me work for tomorrow and maybe the next few days to get me through Denver and through to the Grand Canyon which was my ultimate destination, and after which I don't care what happens. I work hard, if you have anything short term better to offer as this is 8 hours for $60 distributing flyers which is hopefully not a scam(but I like walking). We could help each other. Or if you got a couch. Or if you know of a spot. Trying to save or make as much as possible.  I understand this isn't craigslist, but i'm not a bot, just a normal person traveling through looking for a short term work gig and hoping not to sleep in my car tonight and the next few days(I don't even mind the sleeping in it but have anxiety and more worried about being \"caught\", getting towed, arrested, and all that type of stuff. I tried couchsurfing, but haven't got a response on there. 100% feel free to delete and or yell at me ;)...no biggy. <eos> \n",

Its a crazy time of year and after the reminder didn't get much traction I wasn't expecting a big turnout. We had a nice time and had a cup of coffee and then parted ways after about an hour.

She's going to be kind enough to help with organizing a few meetups until /u/Airship_Captain returns and help us keep an eye on the place. She's been to a few of my meetups and has been a good member of our sub, so I hope you'll all give her a warm welcome! <eos> \n",

Going to get more flyers and canvas a wider area. Thank you all for your concern, and I will try to keep you updated.  Edit 2: (4/29/16) Guys! We got a call yesterday from someone who lives close to our apartment complex saying they might have seen our cat run into a storm drain. We set up shop by the storm drain with her small carrier kennel, some food, and some water. We waited for hours and hours but she never showed up. So I set up my GoPro inside the kennel with some food to see if it's even our cat. About an hour after we went to bed and started filming, there she was! Eating the food. She looks like she is limping from some unknown injury, but we're confident we can get her back today. I'm off to the Humane Society now to get a Humane cat trap and see if I can get her in some time today. <eos> \n",

Additional information: * We are chill twenty-somethings that won't besmirch your lands. * We are trying to do this on the cheap. * None of us drink so we are not interested in bars or pubs. * Any ideas are welcome from \"cool place to watch the sunset\" to \"hiking\" to \"best hole-in-the-wall\" to \"disc golf\" etc. If you like doing it, we will probably be down for it. Thank you, redditors of Lincoln! *EDIT: The road trip is over now. 10 days and 14 states of glory! Thanks for all your help!  <eos> \n",

Is it sold anywhere in town, or do I just have to settle for sake (nothing against sake, I love it)? I know this is one helluva long shot.

            "<bos> I have lived in Lincoln now for a year and have had TWC for my ISP. When I first moved out here I had the absolute worse customer service experience trying to get TWC to come out and setup my internet. Since the initial setup woes I haven't had any issues with TWC until today when I got my newest bill. My monthly bill went up from $34.95 to $53.95 without any notice. I used their chat service and the rep told me my account was subscribed to a roll-up service and that is my new monthly rate for the same package. Great. I surely never remember that when I setup this current TWC account. From the sound of things I must of gotten in on a promotion. Only thing is I have had TWC at two separate cities (in Ohio) and always paid that $34.95 for the same internet package. This is going as far back as 2008. I understand increasing a few dollars but not twenty. I bring this up because I am moving to a new apartment complex and they have a partnership with Windstream. They offer 120 channels of DISH if you go with Windstream for your ISP. I wasn't going to switch until this whole price hike with TWC. I am curious if anyone else can shed some light on their experiences with Windstream versus TWC. I have read online Windstream has some piss poor service and can drop to below 56k speeds during peek hours. Would do you think? Any input from you guys is greatly appreciated.  <eos> \n",
            "<bos> Per the recent vote, /r/lincoln's second 2013 meetup will take place this coming **Friday, March 15th, at 6pm**. I called Tokyo on Friday and placed a reservation for 15 under the name \"Reddit\". They're putting us in the grill area. Tokyo Steakhouse is located in a little cove just south of the ShopKo **near 27th  Hwy 2**. After Tokyo Steakhouse, we will proceed to the bar W.C.'s south, located around 20th  Hwy 2. There is no timeframe for when this might occur. I'm assuming we will be at Tokyo for a good two hours. For anyone unfamiliar with Tokyo Steakhouse, it features sushi, and many other \"grill\" items as well -- you could even get something as basic as Chicken Fried Rice there if you wanted to. It's a place where they cook it in front of you. They have alcohol as well. **Please post here** if you intend on making the March 15th meetup, and how many you will be coming with. Hope to see you there! :) <eos> \n",

            "<bos> Does anybody know anything about gym cancellations through local law? I can't really find anything about it, and I signed up for a gym that I realized shortly after that I don't like the new gym. Unfortunately it's a year long contract, but I saw California had a lemon law with gym contracts, and was wondering if anybody knew if Neb had something like that? Any help would be appreciated! Edit: to anyone checking in on the thread, or anyone interested in leaving their Gold's gym contract, turns out they have a 3 day grace period to get out of it, which sucks if you're someone like me who sits on things before doing anything. Still going to see if there is something else I can do. <eos> \n",

(Also a decent bathroom would be dandy) We figured it'd be easier to find somewhere we liked by asking people in Lincoln what they have/have had instead of just going to the real estate companies.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions! <eos> \n",

What I\\'m looking for is a bit odd, but bear with me. Is there a place in Lincoln that does something like a nacho bar to go, where you can go in and get nachos made up with the cheese, meat, and whatever toppings you desire on them? I went to college in Wayne, and for anyone that\\'s been there, they know the Mucho Nacho from the gas station can be a great stop for food after going through the bars. While it doesn\\'t have to be a \"gas station nacho bar\" by any means, and again, I certainly understand it\\'s weird, but is there a place in Lincoln that has this? <eos> ', \"<bos> Does anybody here have any experience with the Modern Language major at Wesleyan?

I'll head to the Mill a little before hand and grab some seats. I will also print out a reddit alien to put on the table so people will know where we're at.

Or if anyone is a carpet cleaning genius that can help me out, that works too, but if anyone has any recommendations, I’ll take those! We have a couple cats that peed on a rug on top of our carpet and we didn’t catch it right away...not sure how long it’s been there but it didn’t catch our nose for awhile.

He joked about being a serial killer and stalker, which should've caused us to tell him to fuck off but we were so weirded out by him that we let him talk to us.  He asked my girlfriend a few strange vague questions, claiming to have recognized her from somewhere. She was vague as well in her answer but we think he would be able to eventually find her from the information he gathered. We need advice in this situation. Should we report suspicious activity to the police in case this guy actually is a cause of concern or should we let it blow over since it's probably nothing.  My girlfriend and I have already talked about it and she's going to be more aware of the now potential stalker, she will call the police the moment she sees him and she will be aware when she leaves work if she's being followed home or not. Any advice is helpful and appreciated. I can't tell if it's nothing or something. Thanks. <eos> \", \"<bos> I have just moved houses and my new house is right by A Street.

As I was doing a walkthrough I noticed there were a few things I wanted to update and was just wondering if anyone has any experience or knows pricing options for a couple home improvements I want to make. These would require me to probably call on someone as my DIY skills in these departments are less than stellar to put it nicely.  What I want to do is: - Add a couple outlets to my living room that do not exist currently. I'm assuming this would require some rewiring and installation, but not being an electrician I would have no idea.  - Adding a garbage disposal to the sink in the kitchen. I believe I need to do a slight replumbing job as well as installation of the disposal, but again, not a plumber either, so I can't say for certain.  If anyone has any idea on average pricing models for these kinds of projects, or even some recommendations on who to call to inquire about it, that would be great.

The meeting **time is TBD**, and will depend on the winning venue. Dino's had the second most support last time, so it returns to the ballot, among three fresh choices. Here are the four named contenders this round:  * **Dino's EastSide Grille (84th  Van Dorn)** * **Parkway Lanes (48th  Van Dorn)** * **Lucky's Lounge East (52nd  Cornhusker)** *(edited @ 30min to fix this location)* * **Sun Valley Lanes (West 'O'  Sun Valley Blvd)** One thing to keep in mind is that most of our meetups are held at *two* locations. The follow-up location tends to be within striking distance of the first, and is decided in a less formal manner -- either in the RSVP/411 thread the week of the meetup, or at the meetup itself. What we're voting on here is simply the *starting location* for this meetup. As always, you can also cast a vote for anywhere which isn't one of the four named choices, by simply naming it instead of one of the options listed above. Voting will conclude Sunday night, April 7th at 11:59pm. At that point, all responses will be tallied and the winner will be determined. An RSVP/411 thread will be created the week of the meetup to gauge attendance and provide additional information for anyone showing up. ***Please reply with your vote!*** <eos> \", \"<bos> *I've lived here about a year and a half—just long enough to have done some exploring.

I don't mind paying for new tires for the winter season (I'll be moving in January), but I also want to make sure it's an investment (my position may require me to be in Lincoln only be a year or two).  * Another car-related question: My friend in Omaha had hail damage to her car when she first moved there.

I'm moving to Lincoln in a few weeks, as I was just offered a position in the city. My work is downtown, but I was told to avoid getting housing there for reasons I don't want to mention.

I'd like it to be within 3, maybe 4 hours drive from Lincoln. We like nature, history, good food, and although I can't drink at the moment, craft brews and wines are also of interest.

We used to get together at a friend's house about every 2 weeks or so to hang out and role play or develop our fursonas. My partner (blue husky) and I (grey wolf) attended our first convention (Furry Fiesta in Dallas, TX) this past March and it was a blast. We met so many amazing people. I was actually really surprised by how cool the hotel staff was. My partner and I wouldn't have had to spend money on our room if we'd know we were going to be pawing off and yiffing all night with a few other furverts in their suite, but that's a story for another time. We're also planning (tentatively) to go to: * Central Plains Fur Con in Wichita, KS (September 1-4, 2016) * Furry Migration in Minneapolis, MN (September 9-11, 2016) * Midwest FurFest in Rosemont, IL (December 1-4, 2016) If we end up meeting any other people around here that are interested, they might certainly be able to tag along. That being said, does anyone know of any furry enthusiasts/groups/clubs around Lincoln or Omaha? If not, maybe we could look at starting a group around here.

At roughly 0630 I came down Old Cheney and turned onto 14th. I am tired, I work overnights for the state, I want to get to bed. Ahead a red Chevy Tahoe LTZ named SMITTY turns from the West, far lanes it (into my intended lane) and proceeds to do 3 under -in a 45. As I approach, I get the brake lights, and he drops to 32 in a 45. I\\'m Irritated at this point, there\\'s no reason for this. And then out the window as I pull into the turn lane (passing him in a turn lane, lol right?) I hear \"Fucking bitch!\" To the point over my anecdote: your drivers here suck. Not only do they not signal, pull far lane at the inconvenience of others, and in general not obey common courtesy like the speed limit, they think they\\'re RIGHT.

I recently resurrected/repaired a motorcycle I bought years ago with the intent of learning to ride, actually re-learn since I had learned once back in the 1970\\'s on a bike similar to this one.  I approached the examiner when I was called, and explained that I wanted to sit for the written motorcycle exam. He proceeded to tell me that I needed two forms of address verifying identification (me thinks huh? OK...) so I\\'m digging around in my wallet trying to find my car registration when he looks at my drivers license and says \"I can\\'t accept that as a valid ID.\" I look at him and say \"But this is a valid state of Nebraska drivers license issued in 2012\", he tells me that he will check. Tap, tap, tap, \"No, I can\\'t accept that as valid ID, it doesn\\'t have the little gold star in the corner\", he says. \"Gold star?\" I ask, now piqued that my entirely valid and in-force drivers license is somehow inadequate to identify me. \"But this ID was issued by your department identifying me, it doesn\\'t expire until 2017!\" I finally exclaim to the poor hamstrung examiner. \"Per a 2009 law, we require you to prove your identity and residence address to obtain an ID\" the examiner tells me. I, look at my now (questionably valid?) drivers license again, seeing that it was issued in 2012, and again iterate \"but, the DMV issued me this in 2012...\" my voice now drifting off as my mind ponders this Kafkaesque scene playing out. The smiling examiner is now proffering a sheet containing a bullet list of those things which qualify as proof.

Weekdays? Weekends? afternoon evening? What do you prefer?  **Where?** My knowledge of Lincoln is still rather limited, I've been selecting potential meetup locations based on what I've known downtown. It's occurred to me there might be other locations local redditors might prefer. April weather should be more suitable, if not a bit brisk, for a possible meetup outdoors. There's also a few places that have weekly Karaoke that might provide some entertainment for those attending. Or possibly a trivia night somewhere.  Let us know what you want to do, or what events you know about! **The Process** A week from today I'll put together whatever information we have and come up with a couple options to be voted on by the community and post another thread.

I just discovered The Front Porch. It’s a coffee shop with a play area inside of Cross the Line church at 60th and Adams. It’s open 7-6 and has a big comfortable room with not-expensive coffee and drinks and snacks for kids. It also has a separate (free) play room with a big climbing structure and several plastic little tikes climbers. It is like a smaller version of the sorely missed Ager play Center. It has a gymnasium but that has limited hours: 2-4 pm. It also has an outdoor playground but we didn’t check it out. Overall it’s much cheaper than Lost in Fun or Champions Fun Center but seems suited for littler kids than those.  I don’t go to this church (or any church) but I think this place is fairly new. I certainly hadn’t heard of it and thought I’d pass it on to any other parents stuck at home with kids this winter.  <eos> ', \"<bos> So *apparently* I signed up for a class in the Plant Science building at 6 on Tuesdays.

As usual, meeting time is **TBD**, and will depend on the winning venue\\'s hours. Anyone can vote. No votes are allowed \"against\" a place - only for. You can only vote for one location. **Vote by simply replying in this thread** and *explicitly* stating your selection (ex.: *\"Obviously X is going to win, I\\'ll be there!\"* is merely an assumption, and wouldn\\'t count as a vote should X be overtaken. Simply stating the name of the place is sufficient, but any amount of other text is fine as long as the intention of voting is made clear.) That said, here are our named contenders for May: * **Tico\\'s** (17th  \\'L\\') * **Macaroni Grill** (27th  Pine Lake) * **FireWorks** (84th  Old Cheney) * **Mongolian Grill** (66th  \\'O\\') As always, you can alternatively cast a vote for anywhere which isn\\'t one of the above four choices. If your pick doesn\\'t win and is a sufficiently viable location, it may well be a named choice in the next voting round. This month\\'s list contains no repeats from the previous named list, but does include a location that got a vote in last month\\'s comments. Most meetups eventually carry on to a second location in the vicinity of the first. Second locations are usually decided in a less formal manner - by suggestion in the reminder thread posted the week of the meetup, or at the meetup itself if there are several apparent options. Voting will conclude Wednesday night, May 8th at 11:59pm. At that point, all responses will be tallied and the winner will be determined. An RSVP/411 thread will be created the week of the meetup to gauge attendance and provide additional information for anyone showing up. ***Please reply with your vote!*** <eos> ', '<bos> Just curious what everyone likes to do after the food portion of the date.

So far, I've only purchased meat from the Hy-Vee off Old Cheney and 40th and, while it wasn't bad, their selection was a little disappointing and I've never been impressed with Hy-Vee steaks. I'm not looking for top of the line steak, but I would buy most of my meat from Fareway, in Iowa, and I'd like something on par with that. Are any of the other local chains better in the meat department or are there any butchers with good values? I'm also fairly excited to have new foods available to me. Asian and Middle-eastern markets are not something I've ever had access to. Any suggestions for good ethnic markets with minimal cringe factor for my 'picky' girlfriend.

Both my GF and friend had three drinks and don’t remember anything after that. This is highly unusual for them as both can handle their liquor. Both became sick and unable to attend the concert. Luckily both made it home safe. Thanks Lyft! A mutual friend saw them and commented that they didn’t appear drunk but drugged. My GF remembers almost nothing. In ten plus years of dating I’ve never seen her the way act the way she did after arriving home.

A cousin who, in the past, has made some horrible and awful decisions. However, I, and the rest of my family, still love him to bits. We want him to know that we'll be there for him and love him.  He got in touch with my Father and his brothers a year or so ago and they all met and I got to talk to him on the phone for the first time in something like 5/6 years. However, within the next coming weeks his phone line was disconnected, and I'm fairly certain his parents had something to do with it. Our family is having some very terrible problems with his parents, and they keep him from us because they're embarrassed? I'm not sure. He made awful choices and most people wouldn't want to associate with him, but that's not how it works with my family. His name is Justin Olson. He's over 6 foot tall with blonde hair, in his late twenties/early thirties but he's always looked younger. I don't know anymore, though, I haven't seen him for 9 years. Is there *any way* I can find him? Myself and my sister/cousins have looked for him before and don't even know where to start. He's not on social media, and his parents have things in their names so we can't find anything out about him. He could be dead and nobody would know. Any advice? Are there people we could call? Should we just give up? I don't know... it's just sad.  <eos> \", '<bos> Any juggalo/juggalette redditors in lincoln?

Vote by replying to this thread and naming your choice. Upvoting someone who has voted for one of the choices *does not* count as a vote; **you must reply to this thread with your choice for your vote to be counted.** You can also vote for anywhere which isn\\'t one of these four choices, by simply naming it instead of one of the options listed above.

Michael Industries) along with Venue Restaurant  Lounge will be hosting a [brunch and art show.]([url link] The full brunch buffet will start at 11:30am and run until 1:00pm and each ticket comes with a steel snowflake from our 2013 collection. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the American Cancer Society and Dayna's Dream Big Scholarship, which is a local scholarship fund in honor of a recently passed teacher from LPS. Along with the food and snowflake, my company will also be displaying a variety of sculptures and some new lighting products that we are releasing this spring.

We had about 20 people show up for an extremely hazy -- perhaps bordering on belligerent -- downtown adventure. Predictably, there was even a *sub*-subreddit meetup I know nothing about, which occurred because a smaller group formed and never located the greater meetup group.

Come one, come all to the Reddit meetup, Madsen's edition. **Friday, 31 August 2012, from 8pm onward, join us at Madsen's Bowling  Billiards, 48th  Dudley.** Madsen's should have something for everyone, so even if you suck at bowling (like me), there's plenty else to do... I do still plan to bowl at least a round though. Madsen's has bowling, billiards, a spacious lounge area, bar food (their site's down, but [here's]([url link] an archived copy of the menu), a beer patio, pickle cards, and I think one of those machines where you can pick the song that you won't even be able to hear in return for your first born. Overall this should be a bit easier on the pockets, as pitchers aren't $15-20 as we encountered at Yia Yia's.

This is a FREE SHOW that runs 10 weeks from June 1 - August 3. The event is held at Railside plaza downtown, doors open at 6, bands go from 7-11pm. There are usually 3 bands and a DJ.  Right now we are accepting applications for bands, singer-songwriters and DJs to come and play. This is a pay gig and you are of course allowed to sell merch. It\\'s a pretty great opportunity to get your music out of Lincoln and Omaha and in front of an eager Mid-NE crowd. Application link: [url link] There are also food trucks and a beer garden as well as the occasional event for community participation (like a group art project for example). Most people bring their lawn chairs but some stand in front of the bands or dance. In past years this was organized by Hear Nebraska. This year with Hear Nebraska transitioning to non-profit Rabble Mill they have handed the booking and promotion over to the GI organizers (including myself). We\\'ve booked bands in the past that play \"mostly original\" music but are opening it up a bit this year to bands that do covers and might even have a couple tribute bands on the bill.  The application is staying open another week and then we will be sorting through the bands and booking. Share the link below with any bands that you think might be interested in coming to play! Thanks for checking this out, PM me if you have any questions or would like more information! Facebook: [url link] Instagram: [url link] Twitter: [url link] ---------- Also, as I mentioned it is unrelated to us but Rabble Mill (former Hear Nebraska) is also looking for bands to come play the awesome Good Living Tour across the state this summer.

I think they changed it due to that teen's car crash a while back but lately Cronhusker, at least east of 27th, has been an absolute hassle if you want to turn left.

I don't need cable, but I definitely need Internet. Furnished would be helpful, but not required and I don't expect it. How does the bus system work? I believe I read that UNL students can ride the buses for free, is that correct? Also, I know there are routes between the campuses, but where can I find where else the buses go in the city? This has been a huge factor when I've looked at housing, since I've been doing it based on how far they are from the campus. I plan on viewing these places when I visit.  Employment.... While I'm an alternate as a TA and the department has given me a lead on a well paying job, I obviously don't want to bank on either of those. I'll have a BS in Geographic Science and have extensive GIS skills, but I haven't seen much in terms of employment in that department in Lincoln. It's also difficult since I have no idea what my schedule will be. I'm just looking for something that I'll be able to pay my bills with, at the very least.  Any tips here would be appreciated... I have tons of questions, since I'm moving across the country in excess of 1200 miles, but these are the main things.

Holmes Park was the only place specifically mentioned so Holmes it is. Normal and S 70th Street intersect on the corner of the park for those who may not have been there before.

As it was an older car that I have used extensively throughout the years, I only had \"liability\" insurance at the time of the accident, so I have no way of getting funds from insurance for a new car even though someone was great enough to follow the guy and get his plate number and the location of where he abandoned the truck.

We've canvassed the entire area, put up flyers, the whole lot. She's an American Shorthair, grey on top, white on bottom. She likes people, but will be skittish. We love her very much and would like to find her soon. If you guys see her, let me know PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Edit: (4/25/16) Nothing yet guys. Still looking. Going to get more flyers and canvas a wider area. Thank you all for your concern, and I will try to keep you updated.  Edit 2: (4/29/16) Guys! We got a call yesterday from someone who lives close to our apartment complex saying they might have seen our cat run into a storm drain. We set up shop by the storm drain with her small carrier kennel, some food, and some water. We waited for hours and hours but she never showed up. So I set up my GoPro inside the kennel with some food to see if it's even our cat. About an hour after we went to bed and started filming, there she was! Eating the food. She looks like she is limping from some unknown injury, but we're confident we can get her back today. I'm off to the Humane Society now to get a Humane cat trap and see if I can get her in some time today. <eos> \", '<bos> Anyone have any info? <eos> ', \"<bos> I've checked a few gas stations but no luck.

We will be traveling through Lincoln and we need some ideas for activities while there. Any ideas? Additional information: * We are chill twenty-somethings that won\\'t besmirch your lands. * We are trying to do this on the cheap. * None of us drink so we are not interested in bars or pubs. * Any ideas are welcome from \"cool place to watch the sunset\" to \"hiking\" to \"best hole-in-the-wall\" to \"disc golf\" etc. If you like doing it, we will probably be down for it. Thank you, redditors of Lincoln! *EDIT: The road trip is over now. 10 days and 14 states of glory!

Is it sold anywhere in town, or do I just have to settle for sake (nothing against sake, I love it)? I know this is one helluva long shot.

Walmart never got them. Anyone know of any other stores that carry the ipad mini?  <eos> ', \"<bos> I have lived in Lincoln now for a year and have had TWC for my ISP. When I first moved out here I had the absolute worse customer service experience trying to get TWC to come out and setup my internet. Since the initial setup woes I haven't had any issues with TWC until today when I got my newest bill. My monthly bill went up from $34.95 to $53.95 without any notice. I used their chat service and the rep told me my account was subscribed to a roll-up service and that is my new monthly rate for the same package. Great. I surely never remember that when I setup this current TWC account. From the sound of things I must of gotten in on a promotion. Only thing is I have had TWC at two separate cities (in Ohio) and always paid that $34.95 for the same internet package. This is going as far back as 2008. I understand increasing a few dollars but not twenty. I bring this up because I am moving to a new apartment complex and they have a partnership with Windstream. They offer 120 channels of DISH if you go with Windstream for your ISP. I wasn't going to switch until this whole price hike with TWC. I am curious if anyone else can shed some light on their experiences with Windstream versus TWC. I have read online Windstream has some piss poor service and can drop to below 56k speeds during peek hours. Would do you think? Any input from you guys is greatly appreciated.  <eos> \", '<bos> Per the recent vote, /r/lincoln\\'s second 2013 meetup will take place this coming **Friday, March 15th, at 6pm**. I called Tokyo on Friday and placed a reservation for 15 under the name \"Reddit\". They\\'re putting us in the grill area. Tokyo Steakhouse is located in a little cove just south of the ShopKo **near 27th  Hwy 2**. After Tokyo Steakhouse, we will proceed to the bar W.C.\\'s south, located around 20th  Hwy 2. There is no timeframe for when this might occur. I\\'m assuming we will be at Tokyo for a good two hours. For anyone unfamiliar with Tokyo Steakhouse, it features sushi, and many other \"grill\" items as well -- you could even get something as basic as Chicken Fried Rice there if you wanted to. It\\'s a place where they cook it in front of you. They have alcohol as well. **Please post here** if you intend on making the March 15th meetup, and how many you will be coming with. Hope to see you there! :) <eos> ', '<bos> I just wanted to employ the wonderful entity of Reddit to see if there are any good places to apply, thanks! =) <eos> ', '<bos> Is there a place in either Lincoln or Omaha?

Just a reminder that this Friday is the meetup at the Mill downtown at 7:30 pm. If you're planning to attend it would be awesome if you RSVP'd in [this]([url link] thread so I have a rough idea of a head count.

I can't really find anything about it, and I signed up for a gym that I realized shortly after that I don't like the new gym. Unfortunately it's a year long contract, but I saw California had a lemon law with gym contracts, and was wondering if anybody knew if Neb had something like that? Any help would be appreciated! Edit: to anyone checking in on the thread, or anyone interested in leaving their Gold's gym contract, turns out they have a 3 day grace period to get out of it, which sucks if you're someone like me who sits on things before doing anything. Still going to see if there is something else I can do. <eos> \", \"<bos> Anyone have any experience renting at Northridge Apartments?

Just a heads up, the meetup is next week Saturday January 25th @730. We're meeting up first at Old Chicago and then later moving onto Starlight Lounge.

The talk was focused on genetic screening, which I think is a better option if you're a small town like your dad used to be a decade ago\n",

But in my experience, the answer seems pretty obvious: it isn't good. The whole system is very different from what I've seen on an academic level, for different reasons. I do\n"
