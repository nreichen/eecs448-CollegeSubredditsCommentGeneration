The top reply was: All the dining halls are all you can eat, the A La Carte locations (listed above by /u/palmtree5) are pay per item. No ripoffs, just sometimes meh food. Download the UI Dining app to see the menus for each meal on a daily basis! So how is the only problem cost? It's all the same.... If you're going into a dining hall for a meal, it's all you can eat. There's no pricing of individual items there. If you're going to one of [these]([url link] that's where the items are priced individually. LAR has a lot of vegan options as well. You can look through the menus of all the dining halls [here]([url link] Be sure to change the date to one after classes have started again and maybe look at a few different days. <eos> \",\n",

Anything I should know about the department and the program? What about the town? Also, tell me what you find awesome about UIUC and UC so that I can feel good about my decision.   The top reply was: Some of my best experiences in grad school were attending lectures, seminars, and arts programming. Every week during the school year, you can find world-class thinkers and creatives on campus. I think the fact that you're 21+ opens you up to a lot of the nice bars on campus and the downtown nightlife. There are spots on campus that a lot of grad students like to congregate such as downtown and the coffee shops, so if you're trying to meet other grad students those would definitely be good places to check out. It's a quiet town but it's got a lot of heart, and there's a lot here for people from all kinds of backgrounds, with over 1000 student run organizations that anyone can be a part of. Congrats on the acceptance! The most awesome thing about UIUC is the lack of funding we have Thank you!  Alright then, downtown and coffee shops, duly noted.  What are you studying at UIUC? /r/uiuc <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Fall semester had about 100 people, with the more popular sections having 12+ members. The audition is for chair placement only Sections might be a little bigger than you'd be used to in a typical high school wind ensemble (I'd say mine about doubled), but like mentioned, auditions are just for chair placement - no cuts! This goes for Campus Band too. Would highly recommend participating if you're on the fence. If you do audition, good luck! Section size depends on the semester. They tend to be large during the fall semester, but a bit smaller during spring due to campus band also being around. I’m sure OP is aware of that. They’re asking specifically about University Band. <eos> \",\n",

They tried to get me to apply - and i did since i didn\\'t know any better. However after some googling, i went up to the \\'recruiter\\' and snatched my application, crumpled it up, and threw it away. Be wary of the company and if you do not believe that Vector Mkt\\'ing is bad news, just start typing in their name on google and one of the auto-completions will be \"vector marketing scam.\" Read up on that. The top reply was: They were tabling in the Union yesterday, and I saw their URL on a classroom blackboard. FYI, any URL that is along the lines of \"winterbreakwork.com\" is Vector. Their tagline is that they offer $20/appt. you can pay to get a good grade in the BBB pretty much. Its not a government agency. Its a company and they have their minds set on profits like every other agency. Genius idea who ever thought of it though. The thing is, it\\'s not $20 an hour -- it\\'s probably $20 per sale commission. Which is fair, but they require you to purchase your own set of knives as a demo set and you basically have to sell yourself out to family and friends to make a profit. The controversy is that many people don\\'t make enough money to recoup their leading loss of buying the knife set. Basically, the scam here is that you need to pay to get a job, which is a huge red flag. I\\'m disappointed that the Union let them do that, yet kicks out Jimmy Johns and Insomnia Cookies when they\\'re giving out samples.   I know it all comes down to mine, but still... They\\'re supposed to be a student union...  Edit: Mine = money I emphasize that it\\'s $20/appt and not $20/hr. They sneakily wrote on the application something along the lines of \"our wage is $20\" (and not \"$20/hr\") <eos> ',\n",

I\\'d really like to spend some more time at the library or wherever using some of the great resources we have to help me out with classes in the future. I know we have access to lynda which is an awesome utility, if anyone could recommend any path that would give me the ability to start working on my own projects or just advance myself in any way I would really appreciate it. *Tl;dr:* if you know of any cool opportunities to learn CS here outside of the classroom, please share your knowledge! Thanks! The top reply was: just find some technology/software you think is cool and build something with it. doesn\\'t need to be particularly amazing or useful, but thats great if it turns out to be. a lot of amazing stuff you see now was ugly hacked together stuff in its early days, it doesn\\'t need to be all professional and polished from day 1. its a process. you can download unity and make a basic game that does cool stuff  or make a website that shows cat photo slideshows and videos with html5 or something and really go all out with JS and make it really fancy or make a CUMTD app participate in google\\'s SoC, hackathons, etc.. there are infinite opportunities to work/learn with CS, its up to you to make them and learn. I also highly recommend participating in one or more of ACM\\'s SIGS and ACM in general. get involved. You will meet a lot of like minded and smart people there, and that should help give you incentive, direction, and help/motivation to learn and create. [cs225]([url link] [cs423]([url link] CS411 was online previously but it appears to have been taken down. cool. good to know, i stand corrected. i checked to see if 225 was being recorded and all i could find was that \"Watch at home lecture\" i didn\\'t look at the left side of the lectures page until just now... I\\'m looking for/adding more as I find them.

It now has some places where color is fading near/around seams, and it could probably use a professional cleaning. Suggestions for where to take it? The top reply was: I don't know. Hopefully they'd be able to give you a better answer. Do you know whether those folks (that Starcrest would send it to) could take care of the color? If you take the jacket to a Starcrest Cleaners, they should be able to send it to a professional cleaner for you. <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Was it relatively easy finding people you could get along with, considering its a big school? Was it hard to meet people? Did you keep the same friends from freshman year? Share your story!  The top reply was: It's been an unmitigated disaster but I've learned to accept it. Drugs and alcohol are always good for meeting people. Nothing like chasing a new friend through the Quad when they are naked and on LSD before the cops see them. You will share a special bond for the rest of your lives. Tfw I've made a lap around the police station outside Siebel while I wasn't a human Came in as a transfer student and it seemed like a lot of people weren't interested in making friends after their freshman year. I mostly ended up hanging with high school friends which was kind of lame. I think it's relatively easy for students here to find others to get along with. Because this is such a big school, there are a pretty diverse group of people and several clubs/interest groups for one to join and take part in.  Speaking personally, most of my friends from freshman year were for the most part high school friends, as the guys on my floor didn't have the same interests as I did (they seemed to love Magic and My Little Pony). When I left the dorm life and onward I made quite few friends both in my department and through a shared interest in games and music. There's not really any point to what I've said above. I think the most important thing about one's experience in making friends at UIUC is ultimately learning what type of person you are. I know that even though the friends that I have met here are super cool and I [think I] get along with them well, I'm just naturally a shut-in who doesn't always feel inclined to hang out with anyone. It is what it is. <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Can anyone recommend a good TA for CS 374 office hours? The top reply was: All TAs are good.... yeah let me finish that sentence. All TAs are good at knowing the material. The vast majority of them are shit at explaining. There's just a handful of TAs who can actually explain the material in a way that just sinks right in. Patrick Lin was a god-like TA with those qualities (not sure if he's still around).  For sure, you will have to attend every office hour at least once, and find out which TA can actually explain it in a clear manner. All TAs are good. Everyone just explains concepts differently and you'll have to go to all office hours to find out whose method suits you the best. Once you figure that out, I guess you can go to their office hours only. Also hopefully by 'good TA' you dont mean that they give you the answer. <eos> \",\n",

I mean they aren't mean but they are always trying to prop themselves up on you. Don't know if I have just met the wrong people or this is the culture within the business school. The top reply was: I've met plenty of pretentious engineers. Given how you are a freshman you've probably haven't met a lot of people yet, so don't worry. What you said: \\\\[potentially\\\\] this is the culture within the business school.  Should be enforced as: this is the culture within the business school.  Should be enforced as:  this is the culture within *any* business school.   Jokes aside, pretentious people are everywhere. Business students who think they're the Wolf, engineers who think they're an inventor, sociologists who think they have society's patterns figured out, mathematicians who think art people are stupid, art folk who think math people are stupid, CS students who think they're world-changing programmers, poli-sci people who think they'll be governor, etc... just get used to people overblowing the fake-it-till-you-make-it thing. If you are a business major, just wait until you meet one of those kids whose dad is a partner at Big 4 and rubs that in your face. As a sophomore in business...I can attest to what you’re experiencing. There is an odd amount of pretentious people. But I feel that every major is like that.  Just be sure to write your own story and be you. No need to join a biz frat or be apart of organization XYZ. There are plenty of non pretentious biz majors as well as many non biz majors. Be around those who vibe with you, thus finding your own path to success. There isn’t any particular blueprint to getting where you want to be. Can’t emphasize that enough. You can find arrogant people anywhere. The culture of the college is to be involved and get jobs and it’s engrained in us to be overtly proud of our accomplishments. Just listen to people with a skeptical lens and remember most of them are used to selling themselves interviews but not everyone only wears their professional hat.

Why does the basement smell like pee? Can he stop staring at me please? How often are apartments sprayed for pests?  Is there a clause in the lease regarding entry by the landlord, and, if so, is prior notice given?  Is this a joint lease or is it severable?  What utilities are included?  Are pets allowed, if so, what kind?  Is smoking allowed?  May tenants use nails or putty to hang things on the walls? Who handles repairs and how quickly are they usually addressed? How much do we need to pay upfront? How well does the toilet flush? Where are the outlets and internet/TV accessories? Why did the previous tenants move out? What is the water pressure like in the shower? Can you hear things from the other side of the wall/floor/ceiling/street? How do I pay rent? The clause for entry does not mean anything. By law, you must get 24hr notice otherwise you can refuse entry (this is for Urbana, not Champaign). Also, all nails (including those to hold up a mounted TV if you want to have one) are considered normal wear and tear. They cannot actually deduct it at the end of the year and if they do, you can take them to court for it and you will win.  Remember everyone, the law holds up before the lease.

Past sitters have travelled within the state with him for the holidays, so if you're visiting family close by that works too. Thanks!

Until this semester, I had no plans of getting into a grad school, but kinda changed my mind this semester. I need 3 recommendation letters from professors/advisers/etc but I am not really sure who to ask. I only know one professor who is likely to write a letter for me. I am not sure how to find the other two. The due date is march 15, so I don't have enough time. Are there ppl in the school who are very willing to write rec letters or will I have to find one outside of the school ? Any experience? The top reply was: How good are you at sucking dick Often times, you can have a TA write you a letter and have the professor cosign it. This happens a lot in biology with medical school applications. Not sure if CS is the same but it's worth a shot. That's probably the only choice for a lot of 3rd rec letters. Ask any professor you have worked with. Ask professors of courses that you got good grades in. etc.  To write a decent recommendation letter, they need to have some materials first. It's impossible to write a decent recommendation letter for a random stranger. Just ask, the worst they could say is no. The real issue here is that you've waited until the last minute, you should give them at least a month to write one. You needed to ask them yesterday. All of your professors write them, it's part of the job . <eos> \",\n",

I\\'ve heard of a group called Toastmasters and am not sure if they\\'re on this campus or a similar group. Anyone have thoughts? I need to brush up my speech skills for my internship and would love to practice during the year. The top reply was: The [three local Toastmasters groups]([url link] Because of their graduated curriculum followed by specialized curricula, the clever way that they involve you in learning to run an organization (you\\'ll soon have roles that you fulfill at the meetings following their written guides to help you learn them), and the guidance they give even in giving feedback, I can highly recommend them. The Speech Team. I\\'m a member and we travel around the country to compete against other schools and qualify for the national tournaments. Speeches range from infomative, to persuasive, to funny. There\\'s also acting or interpretation that can do.  Check out the national forensics association for more info. I\\'m on mobile so it\\'s hard to link. Pm me if you want more info or want to join. Hmm. None of them are specifically for students, but McKinley was welcoming to students and had some when I was active. I would just visit all three, if you have a particular \"fit\" you have in mind. Ooh, looks like Toastmasters has a solid footing here. Which of these groups do you think is better for college age students? It seems like a lot of these are for locals as well, which is good but it would be nice to have a crowd my age as well. I took CMN 101 last fall because they offered it on Tuesday nights only for like 2 hours instead of during the week. If you have some extra credits to fill, it might be worth it to you. I did all of my work in class and had to spend hardly any time outside preparing. The class is focused on speaking in front of your peers. Maybe you could even take it for the first few weeks and then drop before the drop deadline if you\\'re really not into taking more classes, but it wasn\\'t a huge waste of time for me and I did get to experience speaking in front of others. <eos> ',\n",

I\\'m an incoming freshman who will have senior standing at the start of my 2nd year. Would I apply my sophomore year? The top reply was: You could, I guess. But why would you want to? -save $  -get out of school  -star working  people got different goals yes Don\\'t look at your year by credit hours.  That\\'s based on how many credits you transferred in, even ones that are useless for finishing your degree.  It also includes courses (e.g. Calc I and II) that much of the entering CS class (here and elsewhere) places out of.  Placing out of Gen Eds gives you schedule flexibility, but it doesn\\'t necessary let you graduate faster.  Most people can only stand to take a certain number of hard technical courses each term. Your real position in the major is determined by how many CS courses you\\'ve finished.  So e.g. if you\\'ve placed out of CS 125 (or think you will after the fall proficiency exam), then you are one term ahead.  So \"apply when you become a junior\" means to apply when it\\'s going to take you about two more years to finish the major requirements.  Don\\'t rush the schedule unless you discover (e.g. in a year or two) that you\\'re far ahead in the major, or if you\\'re really stuck financially.  When you graduate, you\\'ll be competing for jobs/grad school with students who had just as many AP credits but spent all four years piling up impressive CS courses and internship experience. That\\'s what me and several of my friends are doing (BS-MCS though). As long as you\\'ll be totally done with your undergrad by then you\\'ll be fine - they may even let you finish your last undergrad course or two the summer before you start the MS. <eos> ',\n",

I also heard that Kungfu Tea was opening on campus as well? Any news on that? The top reply was: If you just want regular milk tea, the two are different but pretty close to me, but I would give a slight edge to taipei.

I don't have a ton of friends here so I'm definitely looking for some close bonds.  Also, is it easy to make friends in APO? The top reply was: Definitely, sure you won't be the majority of the rushing class (sophomores, and now freshmen since it's second semester) but it's not odd to see some upperclassmen join, especially transfer students who heard about APO later or people who want a change in social scenery. There are other elements that are APO specific that you can relate to people with, like rush status, rush class, dynasty, family, committee, smallgroups, etc.  I wouldn't say it's easy to make friends in APO, but rather, APO gives many opportunities for you to make friends. You get placed into all these groups randomly but it doesn't mean automatic friends, which I learned when I rushed last semester. You still need to put in the effort to go out to events, hangouts and approach people. Everyone is friendly and kind, especially those involved with the rushing process (which is 10 weeks long btw) so they're more approachable than the average stranger. APO is huge though so finding people who really clicks with you might take a bit, but as long as you are active it shouldn't be difficult. You get out of APO what you put into it. There are a lot of social people and plenty of opportunities to bond with your brothers. I knew people that rushed as a junior and they fit in just fine. Awesome, good luck if you decide to go through with rush! there actually ended up being one and i attended it! Not that I know of, but according to the rush event on [Facebook]([url link] you should email recruitment directors about your situation - recruitment@apo-aa.org <eos> \",\n",

We've got the Titanic Players which features 4 tiered teams doing improv styles like ARMANDO's and expansions tree and much, much more as you get more experienced. Titanic Players are actually a kind of national improv organization with chapters up at UW-Madison, Depaul, Northwestern and more. We've traveled to a couple national collegiate improv competitions where our oldest team placed 2nd I believe. We rehearse once a week and perform once a month at the union. There's also Spicy Clamato, and DeBono which is like musical improv comedy.  I'm actually on the Titanic Players myself and would be happy to answer any questions for you or get you in touch with the more administrative people of some improv groups. Spicy Clamato is hilarious. They used to perform every Monday evening in the Courtyard Cafe, which was perfect for a quick study break. Zoo Improv is a community group that offers lessons. Laura Hall from Whose Line is coming as part of their improv festival this summer. Agreed, Spicy Clamato IS hilarious! There's actually a lot of cross over between the performers in Spicy Clamato, The Titanic Players, and DeBono. I personally think Spicy is the funniest though because its like a collection of the best improv performers from those groups, and their style allows them to do so much funny shit.

He said that the University wants to see how many students are in the library at given times (nighttime mostly) to see if it makes sense financially to keep it open 24 hours a day. It does. Grainger lets me maintain my nocturnal studying and lets me print stuff out close to my apartment.. Good thing they're gonna keep it open.. We do it for 'patron counts'. Every three hours we're supposed to walk the floors and get a count for how many people are in Grainger. At the end of the year, the university uses it to decide how much funding we get and which libraries are getting used more heavily than others. I see library employees doing this all the time at UGL. To be honest, I haven't done any real research on this. I just see people walking around the UGL all the time with some kind of pad while counting the number of people there. <eos> \",\n",

The hawk then flew up to this half wall between Talbot and Everitt where I was watching. No more than 4 feet from me. In my brain, our conversation went like this... me: hiya! hawk: I could tear you apart. The top reply was:  Starting to worry about this hawk and what/who it\\'s going to eat when the squirrels hibernate. Freshmen. I\\'m serious. They\\'re going to eat Freshmen. A turkey, huh? OK, try to imagine yourself on campus. You get your first look at this \"little turkey\" as you enter the quad. He moves quickly, lightly bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement - he\\'ll lose you if you don\\'t move. But no, not a hawk. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that\\'s when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the two other hawks you didn\\'t even know were there. And they slash at you with this... a one inch claw, like a razor. He doesn\\'t bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say... no no. He slashes at your chest, or maybe across your belly, spilling your intestines. The point is... you are alive when they start to eat you.  So, you know. Try to show a little respect. Starting to worry about this hawk and what/who it\\'s going to eat when the squirrels hibernate. Maybe we should release an eagle for hawk-control. Oh, totally misread that.

After half a week of Jimmy Johns and Cravings and a night of heavy drinking I dragged my compacted ass to Calc III after chugging away a cocktail of red bull and black coffee. It was during the middle of the lecture that I felt the beast awaken inside of me. Swiftly, I dashed out of my seat and sprinted to the nearest stall to eject the spent rod before it causes a meltdown in my pants. I zoomed onto one of the decrepit porcelain seats and kicked the door closed to do my shameful business away from human eyes. After a few minutes the beast refused to exit its lair. Desperate and in deep agony I squatted on the rim of the toilet and used my hands to part my cheeks. It worked. A jet black, greasy butt dragon zoomed out of my unsuspecting pooper with a loud reverberation that shook the flimsy walls of the stall. In that brief moment of euphoria I lost consciousness and control of my bladder and ejected an arch of urine in celebration of the of my putrid puxatony phil. Once I regained consciousness I realized the dragon cannot be tamed by a mere flush. I wiped my ass with the gritty paper next to me and left it with a pair of red speckled wings, as a final parting gift to my dear foe. <eos> \",\n",

Then returned to Russia, and been working here at an oil  gas company as an electrical engineer, which is more like electrical power engineer, or power systems engineer here.  I've been doing design of equipment in distribution systems 35/10–0.69/0.4kV, its installation and commissioning, some relay protection.  Due to many reasons, I want to leave Russia, and return to the US and work in the similar area. Thus I have several questions:  1. What are possible companies that I can apply to, where my experience will be relevant? 2. What is the approximate salary range that I should be looking for? Would be really grateful if fellow Illini could help, or point in the right direction for answers. The top reply was: How much research have you done yourself? Google / LinkedIn can answer these basic questions for you. Also reach out to Engineering Career Services. You might want to come back to the US for an MS degree. It is much easier to get hired as a foreign national with a higher degree.  but here I was hoping for suggestions based on personal experience. Career Services has more experience than anyone else here. That would still be my first step, and you didn't address that part of my comment. This is in addition to my research on LinkedIn and Glassdoor (and Google) – but here I was hoping for suggestions based on personal experience. What I've decided for myself is that I'm not interested in energy companies or power system operators, so the closest thing would be Engineering design companies. Yes thanks! That's actually a great suggestion that I haven't thought of. <eos> \",\n",

If so would you say the class would be difficult if I were to take it at the same time as ECE 310? I emailed Prof. Haken and he mentioned that \"You can slide through ECE402 without taking ECE310, but you miss a lot of things.... ECE402 has many algorithms and ideas presented, and ECE310 gives you a much better chance of deeply understanding the algorithms.\" I definitely am leaning towards taking his advice simply cause he would know better than myself, but I really do want to take this class as soon as possible simply cause of my interest for the subject.

For CS majors, we can fulfill up to 2 of our upper level technical electives with non cs classes. So what are your recommendations?  The top reply was: Check out some of the listings at GSLIS. They offer 400 level classes with sections for undergrads, and have some interesting options. Econ 490 - American Economic History, though it\\'s always really tough to get into. The professor, Isaac DiIanni, is brilliant. He\\'s extremely articulate, quick, knowledgable, and really nice. It\\'s a fascinating class taught from a perspective that I wasn\\'t expecting. He\\'s a very libertarian, anti-government regulation guy. All his arguments and teachings were very fact and data-based - he wasn\\'t just giving his opinion. For example, I grew up being thinking that the old industry titans like Rockefeller and Carnegie were \"robber-barrons,\" when in reality that couldn\\'t be further from the truth. The class was really easy, as well. Very little homework (5 simple assignments, I think), and 2 easy exams. Wait, we can? For ENG CS? The goal is to move the class from being a pilot, in STAT 430, to its own course, STAT 490, next year. ECON 450 STAT 400 <eos> ',\n",

I've heard stuff about buying parking passes but I don't really understand how it works. Are there any lots you can pay to park in without a pass? The top reply was: There are lots that you can pay and park in. These lots are typically further from the stadium than the parking pass lots. Here's what you need to explain the parking situation: [url link] I'd recommend lot 49 for a game day pay lot. I tailgate in lot 45 and walk by 49 pretty often. Looks decent to me. Someone else may recommend the research park lots though. Anyone else care to chime in about them? Why not recommend lot 45 then? ;) Research park parking for tailgating can be a lot of fun. I have had a good time over there. Everyone is pretty friendly, there is a lot of friendly banter, and lots of bags/beer pong. With the game being a night game, you might have to get there 4-5 hours early. I want to say in the morning we have been there 3-4 hours before hand. <eos> \",\n",

Somethings wrong with my brain I think. The top reply was: I've gone through this process. It's a pain in the ass, but worth it.  First things first: Call the counseling center first thing when you wake up tomorrow. They'll schedule you a day-of appointment. Explain your symptoms and the issues you're having. You'll talk to a counselor and they'll tell you whether or not they think you're suffering from ADHD, something else, a combination of issues, or nothing at all.  If they suspect an issue, they'll refer you to DRES for an assessment. I'm pretty sure at this point most if not all of the appointments will be booked up, but that doesn't mean they can't try. During the waiting time (took me two months even though I got the first appointment available) you'll have counseling services available to you. I'd recommend attending these. My first counselor was great; second one, not so much. Just make sure you mesh well with the counselor, and if you don't then request to switch. On the day of you're testing you'll go to DRES; the testing can take anywhere from 4-8 hours. Mine took 5. I'd recommend just doing it in one fell swoop; much easier that way. Approximately 8 weeks later they'll tell you your results; if you have ADHD (or anything for that matter) they'll tell you and offer accommodations.  So pretty much: 1. Call Counseling Center, attend appointment 2. Schedule DRES Assessment 3. Continue counseling/attend DRES assessment 4. Wait/continue counseling I wish you luck! You can schedule the DRES assessment without the counseling center appointment. I went through an academic screening for DRES a year ago, they didn’t require me to go to the counseling center first. That said, it’s still a very useful resource. Can you? That must be new; last time when I did it they made me go through the counseling center. Regardless, I hope everything works out for the OP. <eos> \",\n",

Went down in the basement of CLSL during the tornado siren yesterday. Apparently the only carrier that worked down there was Verizon. Don't get T-mobile. They don't allow you to text the bus stops to check the wait times. Every other service lets you. really? Sprint sucks for me.

Now I already have a pdf of the text as well as a solutions manual. How necessary is the other stuff? Is there any way to bypass this webassign+homework requirement? Thanks! I hope I\\'ll still be able to avoid spending 100+ dollars :/ The top reply was: Webassign is a crucial part of homework. You cannot avoid paying it unless the professor screws up somehow and keeps extending the trial period. I\\'d complain about the webassign price but it really is great practice if you actually take the time to do the problems properly. yes you can buy the code individually, its like 50-60 bucks or something. just look on the website and it should tell you how to proceed to do so. not really \"stressful hours\", you just buy a code and type it in your account before the teacher trial ends. If anything, I feel more bad for the people who pay $200 for the textbook. And since he only has Calc 3 left, it would be *especially* stupid to buy the textbook. It\\'s extremely necessary. I always feel bad for the poor schmucks who tried to save a couple dollars at the beginning of the semester, because they end up spending multiple stressful hours during the first couple weeks of class trying to get webassign to work. :( The math department negotiates pretty good package deals for textbook+webassign at the bookstore (our current associate chair is really big on working hard at this), so I\\'d just go with what\\'s for sale there. <eos> ',\n",

Admittedly they are not my best subjects so I was wondering if anyone has any insight to whether physics 101 would be easier at parkland or basically the same? The top reply was: Physics 101 at Illinois is very easy. Cheaper at Parkland so there's that. it is a lot easier and less time consuming. And parkland basically provides free tutoring. I did both physics classes online for an MCB major years ago, and it was so easy I pretty much only showed up for the exams and got an A. If you're looking at med school, even if you do take it parkland, don't take it online. I was just about to take 101 online this summer but there's quite a bit of schools that won't accept an online course as a pre-requirement. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: It’s only your first semester, so just wait until the year is up to make a final decision. If it’s something that you’re really serious about, look at other schools and start writing down their transfer requirements and focus on getting those courses out of the way for the next semester (or semesters). And make sure to keep your GPA in good shape! As a transfer student myself, it’s okay to not find the right school on the first try. Good Luck!! 😎👌 Thank you. As someone else who's looking to transfer, I forgot that I should start looking at required courses. I think the handful of schools I'm considering right now are all holistic admissions, and the CS course framework here is pretty intensive and rigid, so TBD how much I can change courses around next semester, but yeah, thank you so much! And all schools are different when it comes to the courses they want you to have. Some schools don’t even list any required courses. If anyone ends up in that situation, look at the schools gen-ed requirements and program requirements. Just take those until you’re able to go to the school. Also, some of the major schools are on transferology. Which was helpful for me when I was transferring. <eos> \",\n",

Is there any way to make a formal request to avoid unnecessary costs? The top reply was: Have you tried searching the I-Share catalog to see if they are available through one of the partner libraries for checkout? If so, you could always try to check them out that way. Undergrads can't check things out for the same length of time as grad students or staff/faculty, so you might need to wait until you get the syllabus to see when you'll need each book during the semester. This has worked for many of my wife's graduate level Education courses. This is fantastic advice; thank you. I've tried creating an VuFind account for the I-Share catalog, however, and I'm not sure how to tie the account to my U of I library account. Any tips? Ask the instructor, see what they say. You could then try to find someone in the department to help you, but I'm not sure what kind of department employee would be looking out for this kind of thing. Your best bet is to convince the instructor. I always badgered my instructors/professors about this kind of thing. Ask if maybe they could put their personal copy on reserve. There is a form that the instructor has to fill out. The Library has a web form that the instructor can use, in addition to the forms that have to be printed out.

I personally am looking to add a class with the easiest path to an A, as I am at 10 hours for the next semester. I have taken the following similar classes: Stat 100 and CHLH 243 (incredibly easy, a given A), CLCV 115 SOC 100 RLST 110 (All \"easier\" classes, but with written assignments, discussion, and tests they demand enough work where you need to earn the A). Interested in any and all classes, thanks! The top reply was: PSYC 100 is not easy. I repeat, PSYC 100 is a shit tonne of work. Why would you take Econ 102, when you can take Stat 100, 10x easier. ATMS 120 100 level online NRES classes. NRES 102 usually had test averages of 80% but they were really easy as long as you actually went over the material. A couple required discussions, about 5 easy homeworks, weekly quizzes, and a bunch of extra credit movies. NRES 101 is easier but requires a 5-page paper. 3 discussions, 4 quizzes, no homeworks. Super easy tests. Test extra credit was identifying a picture of a raccoon. Lot of extra credit opportunities- field trip, describe a migratory bird, introduce yourself. If you\\'re in a STEM major, I\\'d actually disagree and say that RLST 110 was not that easy. It\\'s 100% memorization of names, dates, and events with no logic or process behind any of it. If you\\'ve recently taken math/science based classes and then jump into World Religions, it\\'s a weird transition to make. I got an A- in that class, but barely.

The [President's/ Pine lounge]([url link] (top left of map on the main floor) are always dead silent. Usually pretty packed around early/mid afternoon though.

The pine lounge is my favorite (along the west side near Altgeld), but there's also the computer lab in the basemen, the front area near the quad and certain spots in the basement. Just walk around. RSO Office is generally alright to study in depending on what societies are around The basement as a whole usually isn't too loud, but I avoid it from about 10:30AM to 2:00PM.

Stores even sell septic-safe TP as opposed to \"regular\" TP for rural homes on septic systems. Clogs and backups are ugly, putting it nicely. Ime, equal weights of the thin and thick TP flow differently in the sewer pipe, with the thick stuff precipitating/aggravating more clogs. That\\'s why I take my business home. It\\'s clean and I come back to school with a clean shiny butt. So does flushability mostly have to do with the thinness of the TP? Because I have to flush basically the same amount of paper. Regardless, this wouldn\\'t be an issue if we used bidets like civilized people. <eos> ',\n",

Giving him 3 hours, and paying out of pocket for your own meter is more than enough lenience. Tow it. Dude it’s your spot. If you park somewhere else you can get towed. Save your own ass.

Thanks for all the feedback, I really appreciate it :) I know it weighs heavy on your conscience, but it’s better you bite the bullet and call the towing company. You don’t want it to become a trend. Plus, you’re paying for that parking spot I’m assuming. Don’t put your money into a meter when you’ve got a spot that does technically belong to you. but I've been towed before and I know how much that costs. And this guy or gal needs to go through the same experience to learn not to park like this. Given that you're paying with meters, you're basically paying this gal or gal to park in your parking spot.

Going to be a sophomore then, I wanted to see if anyone on this subreddit was in the same boat I am right now when applying for housing. Is the transfer cluster really great for those wanting to get together with other students in similar scenarios? I don't mind housing with freshmen, especially if Scott Hall isn't all that great of a dorm, but I wanted to get some insight into that hall and the people that have lived there. Thanks. :)  The top reply was: I live there now. It is great to meet other transfers. In terms of the dorm itself, I've had no problems with it. It's your basic college dorm. AC is a plus. Living in the scott transfer cluster was one of the best decisions I made in my transfer process. Transferring is a pretty lonely time, especially your first semester. Living with a bunch of people in the same boat as you is a perfect breeding ground for friendships. I lived there last year and it was a good opportunity to live with people that were closer to my age than freshman (I was already 21 at the time). You get to live with people who are undergoing the same transition as you and I cannot recommend it enough. Plus Scott is right in front of the bus stop for the 22 Illini. I didn't do it at Scott, but when it was at Hopkins, I was a part of it. I loved it. Meeting people who you had something in common with (not being freshman, but still new to the school) was great. I would highly recommend it to an incoming transfer student, because it was one of the best decisions I made. Is anyone here an incoming transfer student for Fall 2017. I'm at Snyder and I couldn't find anyone here who is a transfer student. <eos> \",\n",

What strategies do you use to justify procrastination?  Some justifications I use: 1. one more B/C grade isn't going to impact my GPA substantially 2. I hate the course, it's boring and useless; doesn't align with my interests 3. netflix/youtube documentaries can be educational too 4. I aced my midterms; It's okay if I don't study for finals. 5.

Specifically, how does financial aid work? how do you know what you owe, etc? I am concerned about getting aid and how much I will have to pay out of pocket. I also would love to hear the experience and adventures while you studied abroad. thanks! The top reply was: im in LAS and studying abroad this semester. i think tuition and aid depend on what program you do. when you apply for a program, there are budget sheets. you can try to look up different program budget sheets from previous years. i had to pay out of pocket because tuition and housing fees were due ASAP after getting accepted. if you think you're tight on money, apply for as many scholarships as you can before its too late haha. also my process with the study abroad office was a nightmare because of my specific program, but i know most people have a really efficient and good experience with the study abroad office so YMMV :) If you're in engineering stop by the IPENG office during their advising hours. They're super helpful and willing to work with you! I studied abroad in Taiwan last summer, and I thought the process was fairly straightforward. You have to submit some essay responses to a few questions (e.g. How will studying abroad help your future endeavors, how will you adjust, etc.), your transcript, copy of passport, recommendation letter, etc. Some programs might have additional requirements, but other than that, I think that's the general gist of the application. Once everything is approved, you will have to turn in some course approval forms and do some other stuff, but your study abroad advisor will definitely help you out with that! Apply for scholarships if you can – it helped reduce some costs for my program by a ton! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! <eos> \",\n",

I graduated in engineering with a 3.8 and was below the cut-off. It varies from year to year but for engineering you'll probably want above a 3.93 at least.

I've tried turning it off, opening window (which does nothing since there is some kind of plastic thing blocking wind from coming in). Even with it off, it gets too humid or stuffy, making it difficult to sleep sometimes. I always felt that the hallways have air condition while rooms have heaters. Is there absolutely no way to keep air conditioning on in the rooms?  The top reply was: (Assuming this is University Housing, not one of the Private Certified halls.) Many of our buildings have single pipe systems, so it's either heat or cool, not both. The newer buildings (Nugent, Bousfield, Wassaja) have in room thermostats where the resident is in control of the temperature. And the non-air conditioned buildings are heat on or heat off. Independent of which building you are in, feel free to submit a [maintenance request]([url link] if your room is too hot or too cold. The hallways probably feel cooler because they're heated less. Depending on the building you're in, its possible its system is one where when the heating is turned on, the cooling system is off. If you're in one of the newer buildings, it's probably a central heating-cooling system. But I've noticed even those have a tendency to get sort of stuffy. <eos> \",\n",

Even as it stands there's not much difference you get access to all engineering resources. It's a historical/LAS loves our donations reason. We're effectively unofficially in the college of engineering. We get access to all of those resources, plus LAS. You only really get shafted with the honors program, but I can say from personal experience it's not really worthwhile anyway. CHBE at Illinois is also well-known and respected. Our RSOs regularly have company representatives/alumni come down for meetings, and we're on the shortlist for some big oil/gas companies as preferred schools to recruit from.

So now I'm basically gaining money (from FA...) because the living is so cheap. Presby would be a possible place to look. It is private housing with apartment style living conditions and a meal plan. It can be more expensive but is an option. <eos> \",\n",

I was about to walk out of my exam because of that. I'm usually a really focused test taker but that was just unbelievable. Wow, prima donna much?

I don't think I will end up failing the class, but a tutor is definitely something I've been considering. I don't know where to start with looking for a tutor. If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated The top reply was: A lot of math graduate students tutor: check out [url link] for a list. Also your course might have its own (free) tutoring hours, or you can ask to meet with a TA occasionally. Literally just talked to my advisor about this for Calc I yesterday. If you go to [url link] you can check out their group tutoring sessions or sign up for weekly one-on-one sessions. Best part is that it's all free and literally right around the corner from Merry Ann's Diner. As someone who is also facing the harsh reality of taking a year off from education between high school and here, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. <eos> \",\n",

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find much up to reviews of NPRE undergrad here at UIUC. What are some people's thoughts on EP vs NPRE? Which do you think would better prepare me for a job in the energy sector (possibly renewable and sustainable energy)? Other majors that might work better for renewable and sustainable energy? Any advice and/or opinions would be dope. p.s. yes, I know my department and engineering advisers are the best people to go to and yes, I do plan on going to them. I just wanted to get as many opinions on this, as it is a pretty major life decision.  The top reply was: If you want to go into into sustainable/renewable stuff, do mechanical, chemical or electrical engineering or systems or basically anything but NPRE. The power track of NPRE focuses on reactor core design and reactor systems. I don't think it'll be nearly as helpful as some other engineering majors. I can attest that ABE is in the college of engineering. They have some ACES connections, but the program is administered by the college of engineering and graduates attend the college of engineering convocation to receive their diplomas.  Source: My brother studied ABE at UIUC. Thanks, I'll take a look at it But I really want to stay in the college of engineering tbh Hello, Im currently a senior in Engineering Physics doing the Energy / Sustainability track. I too am aiming to work in the utilities and renewable energy sectors. I have previous internship experience and have currently begun interviewing with a couple companies. Seems to be going well so far. But I am also doing a minor in EE. Overall it just matters what classes you take and what research/work experience you get.

The top reply was: [url link] As you can see, my notes are old, but I doubt the topics have changed much. 103 should be a very easy A. The labs are easy, well designed, and the \"lab reports\" are in the lon capa system and we got multiple tries and several days to complete them.

There\\'s always a schedule at the end that lists what topics are covered for each lecture. CHEM 103 is the lab course and there\\'s no need to prepare ahead of time for it.

The morning. I know it's not a fun answer, but it's the truth. Also, later at night, but even that's not as empty as the a.m. hours. All of my experience is with the free weight area really, but give it another few weeks. A lot of the resolutioners will give up (and re-appear right before spring break) and you'll be given a lot more space.  On a normal weekday, before 2 is okay and later on is alright (8/9 to close). Weekends are a crapshoot, but earlier is better I've found. Best time I ever went was 6:30am, right when it opened (pulled an all nighter and needed to stay awake, so hitting the gym seemed useful). Maybe 2-3 people in the entire free weights area and 10 in the other areas. Most likely yeah. In my experience the ARC is emptiest in the morning, cause a college student is more likely to stay up later to work out than to get up earlier <eos> \",\n",

My advisor also said that she knew one student who walked the stage in May but actually graduated in December (she never explained how that was allowed). This May is the only chance my parents will ever have to see me walk the stage and I will never forgive myself if I can't because of ONE course (I have A's in all my other advanced MCB courses). I was hoping my final exam would be on the last day of finals week so that way my grade would come out way after the ceremony on Sunday May 14. But the final is well before finals week and the grades should come out before I walk. Would they stop me from walking the stage/attending the ceremony? The top reply was: Thank you for the advice! I am studying, or shall I say memorizing lecture slides and text book chapters word-for-word, but I'm still scared I might not pass. My parents are coming from outside the States and already purchased their plane tickets. Getting them a visa was extremely stressful and took forever. They can't afford to come again so I HAVE to walk the stage no matter how bad I will feel. I understand it is not fair to my classmates who have passed successfully, but I really have no other choice. If it were up to me I wouldn't attend the ceremony at all, I know I don't deserve it but my parents do :( I was in your position. Here are the things I tried and their results:  - Announced I was looking for paid tutoring after class. Everyone stared at me with silent thanks that they were not an idiot begging for a tutor right before finals. YMMV.  - Blew off studying for all of my other finals, and spent 100% of my effort on the class I was failing. This did work, and did cost me a letter grade in a different class. YMMV.  - Told the professor that I needed to know as soon as possible after the final whether I passed the class in order to know if I should invite my family to graduation. He did notify me as soon as he knew. Godspeed, /u/catlaemi. You can do it. I know a guy who walked but failed a required ECE course and had to stay another semester. I am terrified of my professor. But I guess I have no choice. I've been to all the TA office hours, I've never missed a lecture or discussion. But no matter how hard I've studied, I still couldn't get my overall score above D- I don't know how to speak to the professor about my situation.... I would but I'm scared of drawing attention to myself. I don't want to lose the chance of them not noticing my grade before I walk by telling them myself. <eos> \",\n",

I was searching last night and couldn't find any that were open. I tried Davenport, Noyes(I couldn't actually get in the building), and the Chem Annex. Then I gave up.

I work for the university and I know that one of the only unlocked tunnels is Fromm turner hall to beveire You just found the 3 way tunnel between RAL, Noyes and Chem Annex. Nothing illegal about being there -- I walked that every time it was raining for a couple years. It's really hard to find in RAL though -- much easier to start from Noyes your first time, then learn the reverse route. Edit: I think the big pipes in that tunnel are chilled water, but I'm not sure.

Higher education in the US would be a ghost town if everybody waited until their brain developed before making any serious decisions. Top tier shitpost OP. In all seriousness, you might want to wait until your brain has developed at all until you make any serious decisions. Given that you were just conceived, you have around 4 months until you need to worry about that. On the bright side, all human embryo go through a phase where they have gill slits on their necks, so you don't need to try and develop gills, just keep the ones you have problem solved. <eos> \",\n",

Is it just me, or is this class awfully organized and the teacher kinda sucks.  The top reply was: I'm in it now and have learned absolutely nothing. The professor is horrible and I am so tired of him making excuses for why he couldn't get things done. He has an excuse every week. Also what's the point of having a TA if he wants to do everything on his own yet doesn't have time to do it. I am so over this class. I have no idea! I'm planning on going to the review session on Sunday and then going over the objectives of all the lectures and the stupid online quizzes. I did so bad on the first exam because I had no idea what to study. YEP!!!!!! What the hell is the exam supposed to be on anyway..... ?!?! In the class now as well. I don't think that the class is poorly organized, but the professor having a week-long illness definitely stalled things. For the most part, the course is a review of evolutionary principles and applying them to human health and medicine; that being said, you should be applying a lot of knowledge of what you already know (given IB 302 or equivalents are pre-requisites) to real-life conditions. Considering with every topic he gives examples, I think it's as straightforward as it can get. It sounds like you should go into office hours and see where you're misconnecting... Dr. Roseman and Erin are very approachable and I'm sure that they'd be more than willing to help you pinpoint what's going wrong. <eos> \",\n",

I'm really dependent on financial aid, so I want to keep my room + meal plan cost under $11,010.

My number one choice is ISR, but I want other options in case I can't live there. The top reply was: Basically, the rooms will feel like hell in the first few weeks that you are on campus. Once it reaches fall/winter you wont even notice. Nearing the end of the school year it gets pretty bad again, but you can just bring fans. Bring a fan, no problem at all. The first month of school will still be hot as balls though, but that's really the only time having an AC is that relevant Lol what? Vast majority? I don't know about that.. I lived in a non airconditioned dorm. The first and last month of school are gonna be somewhat uncomortable. Just bring a big fan with you and you'll be ok. Most rooms have 2 windows, get two box fans (you get one your roommate gets the other to be fair or whatever) have one point inward and the other outward, boom! Instant circulation. Opening the door works too if you only have one window box fan, cause that also helps with circulation, but isn't so good at night cause of safety. And if two fans is expensive, just get a desk fan and carry it around the room with you and point it at you wherever you are. Being in a non air-conditioned dorm is entirely manageable with fans, unless of course you have severe allergies and don't want to open windows. If you have hay fever or anything like that, air conditioning might be worth trying to get into. <eos> \",\n",

I've heard that Amko (on Springfield) gets a shipment of sushi grade fish in every two weeks. Amko and the new international market that opened on neil As far as I'm aware they have the freshest fish in town and, for whatever reason, they've decided that 1lb is the minimum per person that is worth it for them to order. Seems like a silly thing to complain about. $20-$40 for a pound of fresh sushi grade fish in the Midwest seems legit to me. Use what you need, freeze the rest. If you're eating raw fish, you should freeze it anyway. Since you're not cooking it freezing will kill any parasites. I usually get a pound of tuna or escolar (I also love their scallops and shrimp). We usually make a ton of sushi (more than 2 people can reasonably eat), so I'll also make some tuna tartare, and I'll grill whatever I have left over. Yeah, I'm sure that Chicago has fish vendors who can basically operate like a butcher shop. I'm pretty sure that cheese and crackers orders there stuff from a distributor in Chicago. I'm pretty sure that home freezers get plenty cold, but I've honestly never researched it. I haven't gotten sick from fish from Cheese and Crackers or AmKo yet (I have gotten food poisoning from one of the little kimchi-like 'salad' things at AmKo that they make themselves.

I didn’t see any blueberry bushes marked by Beckman but maybe they’re newer. That being said, I also find it unlikely that the school would plant blueberry bushes anywhere on campus as they’d have to alter and maintain the pH of the soil. The berries might be edible but be careful, and if they taste really bitter don’t keep eating them. 75 + 26 = 100 quick math I don't know about the bushes around Beckman, but the bushes around the NCSA are serviceberries and I've eaten them. Perhaps they're similar? <eos> \",\n",

Last time I went to him asking what classes should I consider, he straight up told me to not bother him with these questions cause he doesn't know anything about the ECE courses offered. So I was like okay nice meeting you and I left. I don't see the point of going there again just to say Hi and leave! I don't get why our university has a stupid system.  The top reply was: Completely agree. If I wanted advice or help, I would meet with them myself. It shouldn't be required. Also idk if other people have to do this but I found out I had to meet with my mentor AND my advisor. Like I know they're different but I really didn't feel the need to meet with either. Don't complain on reddit; complain to your department. Send an email to your Associate Head for Undergraduate Affairs. Assuming that you are an ECE major, that's Prof. Kudeki. [url link] Truly speaking, a mentor who has been assigned to you is a hit-or-miss. One of the most important things for a good mentoring experience is to have a good (personal) relationship with them, and that's never guaranteed with an assigned mentor. Nonetheless, they continue to bureaucratically assign them.  What you should do, not just in school but later as well, is to actively find mentors and build a relationship with them. They can be very valuable resources, but it's not something that can be done by fiat, it takes time. But it's definitely worth it, even as a student I've had good mentors who've really helped me out. I am a graduating senior fam! So your mentor's PTSD was the cause of your 1.91 GPA? Or just his inability to remember your name? <eos> \",\n",

Not going to lie, that's asking for a lot of experience for 55-60k a year. Agreed. I think the salaries for CS/CompE are pretty inflated now, but this offer is still well below market value even with all benefits included. 75-85k would be a better starting range, maybe higher given that you want 3 years experience.

Is there a way that an unexperienced freshman (DGS) like me can get a chance to participate in a research? How do I get started? Do I even stand a chance? The top reply was: You're probably gonna need to be in the department first. Just being honest. A DGS student won't get sought after positions over a student in the department How do I get started? Do I even stand a chance? I'm not in IE so I can't comment about it specifically, but you won't find out unless you try. Go to professors in person and ask them if they're looking for students. If they're not, ask them if they know any professor who is. Good luck! Depends. If they've gotten a few A/A+'a in their STEM courses thus far a professor definitely could accept em. I started by emailing a couple of professors with research interests that I was interested in and asking if they could possibly meet in person to further discuss opportunities. Okay lol maybe for a few ppl yeah, but u are kinda talking rare cases here. I haven't met a single freshmen who successfully find a research without internal help. The chances are low. Imagine yourself as a professor/ lab owner, why on Earth would you hire/pay a DGS freshmen who holds no engineering skills (no offense but that's his/her own words), instead of a bunch of juniors/seniors who already learned how to deal with stuff in their classes? I'm just saying generally a freshmen can't do that kind of job. I'm not saying it's impossible, I just think it would be better for him/her and the team if he/she has enough skills. <eos> \",\n",

A lot of fun if you like animals of all kinds. The lab is hands on (we got to see digesting feed in a cannulated cow) so that was kinda gross, but the cow was real nice and let me pet it. Also the material is pretty interesting, especially because it's all pretty new to me. Anthropology 180 is 3 credit hours, but all you really do is watch movies and talk about interesting topics such as death, vampires, zombies, etc....

The top reply was: As much as its a meme, this is one of the purposes of your college's advising office. Go speak to them, but also go to peer advising and pick their brains for a bit. They may not be able to completely answer your questions, but they are knowledgeable about available courses  Good luck :) I decided to come back to school because I saw what the people at my job looked like after 40 years in the career and realised I didn't want that for me. Where do your interests lie in life? What discipline in life do you enjoy? (science, philosophy, psychology, music?) What profession do/did you find fascinating?  What do you see yourself become in 40years? I have been in your shoes and what helped me understand more was thinking about these questions and that'll help me picture what I want to do in the future. Do some soul searching. Many people go through this. I think it's best to go through this now than 10 years down the road. I hope that was helpful. Also feel free to PM me.

I’m personally familiar with C-Street and the Emerald City Lounge, as well as the Pride RSO. Does anyone else have any suggestions for local sport clubs, typical events, programs, outdoor activities, or anything of the ilk?  The top reply was: Do you have Grindr? If you're into the bar scene, check out C street Thursday nights at Murphy's usually has a decent amount of the LGBT crowd, one of my favorite nights. There's oSTEM as well, which is Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics if you fall under one of those categories. More professional oriented RSO. Other than that your best bet is to just meet as many new people as you can, gay or straight, and just weave your way through social circles and new groups and you'll naturally find some gay or bi guys. It seems to me that part of the issue is that there's a lack of community beyond just self-advocacy for rights. Sure there's the LGBT Resource center, but there are no sports clubs, meetup groups, or central hub, which is completely understandable when only 10% of the 40,000 students may be gay. You'll be hard-pressed to find enough people for a book club, but you can certainly find enough people to fill a bar on a Saturday night. True. Wanna start one? <eos> \",\n",

It's supposed to be 20% each from two assignments, 20% from a group project, and 40% from the final. Talk to your prof or TA. Grading takes time, and sometimes you don't have a ton of stuff due yet. If you feel really borderline based on what you have grades for but there's a stack of things to grade, usually the person doing the grading can do a quick skim of your work and give you an idea of where things will go for you. If you're a freshman I would say yea. <eos> \",\n",

So when I see somewhere I would like to stop do I just pull the yellow wire? The top reply was: Being a small town, not all of our bus drivers have telepathy yet. Yes, they will drive by your stop if you don\\'t tell them you want to get off. They will only stop at designated stops. If no one pulls the cable and no one is waiting to get picked up, they will not stop. This does apply to FAR too btw. A snarky bus driver will zip right past if no one pulls the cable. if you want the driver to remember your stop for next time, pull down on one of those red handles on the window Pull the wire when the next stop on the schedule is the stop you want to get off at They also haven\\'t figured out how to stop on a dime when someone walks into the intersection, that must be big city technology <eos> ',\n",

Just two-and-something years ago, we were the 4th largest college subreddit with 1800 subscribers, now we have nearly 8k. We\\'re constantly growing, and I don\\'t know about you guys, but I definitely haven\\'t researched bus companies before using them, and don\\'t expect most freshmen would either. When you factor in the other stuff that pop up regularly (fav restaurants, what to do for dates, want friends, rso, gf/bf/etc, this/that about class/professor) it really doesn\\'t have much of a presence at all. I guess I interact with enough people who haven\\'t heard anything about SEx that I think the benefits outweigh the the annoyances. At first, I thought Dennis might take a hint that the lawsuits/trolling/etc and revamp his ways and while I don\\'t see myself taking SEx in the future, I guess I do have a slight interest in seeing that he hasn\\'t turned over a new leaf so I can feel justified in warning my friends. P.S. its super lame that people are downvoting you. :( I\\'d argue that a landlord-tenant relationship is different enough from a bus company-rider relationship that the two aren\\'t really comparable. <eos> ',\n",

You may have met the requirements but your college said that you did not complete the extra work for it, then it changed. I think that is what happened but I don't know for sure. Mine got moved up from the 7th to the 4th (where it should've been as a JS). I'm not sure why but the change was made without me even soliciting it. I would talk to your respective advising department. That makes sense. I guess I'll go check it out tomorrow, thanks all :) I'd ask too.

I'm buying tickets rn and they're $32 for one-way and $64 for round-trip. Idk if buying earlier in advance affects the price because I've never really seen the prices change before. It's not that big of a difference but I would like to know so I can plan my trips better in the future. The top reply was: I used to really love riding with PCC, but lately their service has been slacking as their prices increase. Last time I rode on one of their buses, the AC broke down when it was 90 outside, and we had to wait for a new bus for an hour. Their buses also tend to arrive late during the summer. I'm currently waiting to ride with them as I type this, but they're late. -_- They're still better than SubEx, though, so I choose to ride with them. Edit: my bus was an hour late. With the subex fiasco, they have a monopoly - it's not surprising Yeah they have been getting more expensive year after year, and nope the price is not any cheaper if you buy earlier. It's set in stone until it increases again in the very near future ;( This is what happens when there's no competition. I think you might right that it depends on how early you buy them. I just bought a one way ticket three days ago for $30 and checking the same ticket its now $31 <eos> \",\n",

Is it safe to download torrents (from safe, password protected torrent sites) using the internet while living on campus? I am worried about getting hit with fines. The top reply was: Yes as long as you don\\'t get caught...proper opsec.  * Download in bursts over a period of time rather than doing it repeatedly and regularly. * Don\\'t keep hitting or going too close to the 4GB (or is it 6gb now?) bandwidth limit from IT continually * Use \"safe\" torrents with user reviews for quality...also high seedcounts != safe. * Don\\'t be among the flood of idiots using honeypotted torrents after episodes just aired * Use a VPN or seedbox routers for extra safety * Routing through Tor does jackshit other than identify you as \"suspicious traffic\" if someone finds out. Ask the guy who called in a bomb threat at Harvard how far Tor\\'s \"anonymity\" got him past IT. * Private forums public hosts like Piratebay * Don\\'t be known amongst friends/classmates as the guy who can download you anything. * FFS don\\'t go crazy seeding all your stuff, better to be that guy who never seeds.  If you do make sure your roommate also isn\\'t being an asshole with torrenting or hogging up the bandwidth streaming; I know a guy who\\'s internet in the dorm room was shut off because his roommate wasn\\'t careful at all with his torrenting and made too many stupid mistakes. Plus you\\'ll find that most people may have TV shows/music already downloaded so you can copy from them rather than get stuff on your own. I dont think there is a bandwith limit anymore. I use IPVanish for my VPN. $10 a month or $60 a year with monthly payments. [Just checked no bandwith limit at the moment.]([url link] UIUC cracks down pretty hard for torrenting. You can lose your internet access for the year. Didn\\'t stop me from torrenting though. I just used a VPN and torrented through that.

October 6th is the deadline to decide whether or not to opt out of the Homefield Energy aggregation program. The Homefield base price seems lower than Ameren's (though I can't find Ameren's October 2017 - beyond rate so far) but I don't know if they have the reduced price after 800kWh usage in the winter. I think I probably just need to make some calls to Ameren and Homefield tomorrow to figure this out, but if anyone knows anything more about it I'd appreciate the info. My electricity is super expensive in the winter and super cheap in the summer, so I'm thinking I'll stick with Ameren if Homefield doesn't offer the reduced winter price. The top reply was: That seems quite high. How much do u pay in electricity during the winter and summer? I have ameren, live in a 1 story home, and I pay around $100-150 every month. Doesn't matter if it's winter or summer. With gas it's $200-250 every month I wonder if my meter is broken. I never bothered to call since an ameren truck comes by every few months, and they never say anything. The aggregation program through the city is usually the best option for most people. Clearview is the one most people refer to, through there are others with similar tactics. [Here's a list of the suppliers in Zone III]([url link] Interestingly, Homefield isn't listed in our zone's comparison tool, but they're listed in other pages. I don't think so, I think it's a legitimate aggregation through Champaign. <eos> \",\n",

I made the decision to drop the classes to get a better professor (same class /w merit). I then found out that I couldn't add the class without the approval of the heads of the merit program. I emailed them and got no response...  Soo, then I tried to add my old sections back (because they were approved during orientation), but for some reason those also needed approval. So at this point I only have 2 classes and its the weekend so, I'm not sure what to do. I'm pretty sure most of the professors are not going to respond. So any suggestions? The top reply was: Pro tip: you're playing a dangerous game doing something like that at the end of the week. I assume you're a freshmen? Pro tip: First week or two of class is open season to grab classes that were full since kids will be dropping them or switching sections. Just keep your eyes open. If you talk to the leader of the Merit program she can put you in any lecture/discussion. They have spots saved and can override full classes. Good luck Yes, they are still the same leaders as when I took them. Go to your classes. Period. Find the offices of the two ladies and go in there when you are free. They are both very nice and fix everything. FYI in the future when you want to do something like this, the add/drop page will let you web drop courses and add (multiple) others by CRN at the same time. If there are any conflicts at all, none of it goes through, so it will only happen if it works. Do you know who they are? I think it is Gretchen Adams (Chemistry) and Jennifer McNeilly (Math). I emailed them, but I dont think they will respond over the weekend.. Do you think I can just sign up for them on monday? I wouldn't miss any lectures for math and chem since their later in the week. <eos> \",\n",

Consider buying one from Hendrick House and then eating at Newman Hall. 2. 2 Kitchens (1 short, 1 tall) 3. No, they stopped doing that when the kitchens were renovated. It's much cheaper to not get a meal plan and just use that money you would have spent on food joints around campus. Meal plan food is good and healthy, and you get a variety of choices, but you pay for it. $10 a meal or more. But, if you don't use all your meals that week, that money goes down the drain. Just some info, you cannot use the kitchens everyday. You can only use the kitchen twice a week total. It's around 90 miles to there. Get a zip car. The limit is 180miles/day so if you go for at least 2 days it'll work out. As for price. Last I remember it was about $70/day. This guy gets it <eos> \",\n",

Do you think the B could be counted against me heavily? People said to really shoot for a 4.0 but could I justify it by the fact that I'm also doing part time work?  The top reply was: CS. I've yet to meet someone who has gotten readmission to CS so I really just want to talk to someone who has done it What is your major? Anyway, keep doing what you’re doing and apply. An Ece friend of mine failed in some CC courses and still got readmitted after being dropped. Another wasn’t readmitted to ME even though he did exceptionally well, according to him at least since am not too close with the guy. I know someone who got in. I think he needed a certain GPA at Parkland to get back in. He didn't meet the GPA yet got readmitted. Graduated   CS with a low 2. something GPA. This kid was beyond lucky, but my point is that it's very possible. I think you're probably fine? Unless you've done something very wrong you're probably a good candidate for re-entry. Is this after the time frame they suggest to take off (it's usually just a year for LAS but it varies)? If it's not I'd talk to an advisor, most colleges have a re-entry advisor <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Are there any music editing courses at UIUC? I'm interested in seeing what types of techniques people use on the processing end of music composition.   The top reply was: please be more specific It sounds like you're trying to learn about digital music processing/production (which is different from music composition). I would suggest MUS 407: Electroacoustic Recording Techniques 1. There are a decent number of engineers/programmers that take this course, though it helps to have some experience in music. This class series focuses on recording and sound manipulation (both analog and digital) and you actually are assigned projects where you have to create short pieces using prescribed pieces of equipment and sets of techniques. Talk to the professor for more info: [url link] Two other options that focus a lot more on digital music software: [url link] [url link] Someone didn't like my sarcasm :/ Honestly, the best way to learn about music composition and various programs that are used is to search good teachers on YouTube that show how they work and do tutorials to examine their thought process.

I'm wondering if the $10/month actually buys you extra speed. The top reply was: I have the 50 Mbps plan in Champaign and regularly hit the full 50 Mbps, sometimes spiking to around the 56 Mbps mark. Just make sure you get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem. If it is the arris tg862g-ct which seems to be the default then yes it is DOCSIS 3 compliant You either did not use a DOCSIS 3.0 modem or you had a whack router setup. Make sure you at least get Wireless N if not a 5ghz one.  Then again if you network card is shitty on your computer that might also cause tons of packet loss. Generally Comcast will give you very close to the advertised speeds, at least in my experience. Same here! Did you have a DOCSIS 3.0 modem? <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Where you\\'re getting off doesn\\'t matter -- it\\'s just whether the stop you\\'re getting on the bus at is an i-stop _for that line_. Any stop that shows an \"i\" next to the route name will not ask for your ID, all others will. The drivers may have been more lax last semester but I haven\\'t seen a difference. Note also that not all i-stops are i-stops for each route that includes that particular stop. They\\'ve been the same the entire 3 years I\\'ve been here, and are still the same now. Also meaning that if you get on the Green at the Union, they may make you show your ID even though it\\'s an i-stop. (Whether or not they\\'re supposed to do this, they do often do this so you might as well have your ID out just in case.) <eos> ',\n",

Any suggestions on where to work out in the urbana area before I shell out the cash to work out at the arc?  The top reply was: Charter fitness is $20/month and is pretty decent if you don’t deadlift. (Their plates aren’t perfectly round) and there’s a new Anytime Fitness that opened on Neil Street that I’ve heard great things about. The Refinery is far off and in Champaign but I loved it when I was there. Bad bot I need the motivation that comes from being in a public place though. Believe me, I’ve tried working out at home :\\\\ Not sure how plausible this is for ya but you could try working one shift a week at the arc and you get free access. You also make money. You can do decently with a pull up bar ($20), 2 chairs (dips), yoga mat, and resistance bands with a door anchor (can do a lot of exercise me with them and are $30 on Amazon). I’m not sure if that’s helpful at all, but it’s what I use when I don’t have gym access. <eos> ',\n",

Was wondering if anyone had any ideas on possible beneficial minors or maybe something else I’d be able to pick up. Really don’t wanna graduate early as were only in college once. Counselor suggested a business minor but I just don’t see that being very beneficial. Let me know some ideas. Thanks guys.  The top reply was: Honestly, a Minor doesn’t help much more than more classes in any field. I have a minor in Chemistry, but it doesn’t show on diploma, maybe only somewhere on official records.  Take classes in subjects that might interest you, but are outside of Engineering. Take an art class, a history class, a social science, etc. Well-rounded education will help you more. Remember, anything you study can become talking points for interviews/networking. I want to see some type of return on the money I’m putting. Extra secondary classes will to little to help you stand out. You could also consider taking more classes in your secondary. architecture can be good for civil The TEC minor is 30 hours! I'm not sure how useful it is, but I think there's some real merit to fitting entrepreneurship into your schedule, especially if you eventually want to go independent. <eos> \",\n",
              " '<bos> It isn\\'t happening now, but the recent \"What was that loud bang\" post reminded me I intended to ask about this on reddit. A few times a month I notice that southeast Urbana has this terrible chemically, metallic smell -- like hot metal shavings doused in a mixture of machine oil and coolants. It usually seems to last 2-3 hours. Given the length of time the odor lingers and the long, but regular, intervals between occurrences (and the memories of working in a machine shop it conjures), I am guessing some industrial/commercial operation in the area. Anyone have any idea? The top reply was: You may be referring to the smell generated by the Kraft cheese factory. Depending on where the wind blows, you will smell this in different areas. I have even smelled it as far as places like Mahomet. Flexi-n-Gate is located on East University Ave. It is possible there is a smell from there. There is an asphalt company on east university as well - near the MTD bus barns - which can also release fumes occasionally. You are near agricultural land and Nitrogen is spread at different times of the year and it can drift some. But the wind today is from the south so I would assume the smell is from there as well.  There used to be a good machine shop on Washington near Philo Road - not sure if it is still there. I think it\\'s a bit late in the season for wide spread manure spreading on fields. There are some UIUC dairy operations south of you on Race or Vine. Finally wild guess - the Fire Training institute on south 1st street has regular fires as they train fire fighters. That old smell was nostalgic for autumn, to me. Usually it meant that the wind had finally changed direction to be more out of the NW, and accompanied some drop in humidity. Ah, autumn. ...as opposed to similar pleasant memories of early spring, when it finally smells like actual shit and it\\'s a warm humid day... In objectively better smells I notice sometimes the roasting smell from Columbia Coffee smells kind of like maple syrup, almost. Oh that\\'s a good point. There are one or two coffee roasters in Urbana now and that aroma can carry a long way. But that does not smell like a machine shop one hopes. I think since they removed the Humko part of the complex (and replaced it with a warehouse) that old smell is pretty much gone. <eos> ',\n",

The top reply was: I'll contact the people in charge and find out if they can make the tp disappear entirely, thereby making it as thin as physically possible. Good question! 50? Are you attempting to wipe as you are defecating? You can fold toilet paper back on itself repeatedly to increase the effective thickness and strength.

The top reply was: They will not let you unless you have very good extenuating circumstances. You will lose any financial aid or scholarships. Many things universities are contingent on full time status. You\\'ll lose your health insurance too. Stick with 12 hours just to stay full time for that. How about adding an 8 week independent study to keep the hours up? Ouch, so much edge. One has to wonder though: what vast, gaping hole in your life could you possible be compensating for? lol I mean, c\\'mon... These unprovoked, toxic interactions of yours aren\\'t even exclusive to me. So much spiteful disregard for the fact that, honestly, nobody cares what you have to say (nor do they care for the would-be impending \"I know you are, but what am I???\" argument). that would be ridiculous. \"sorry you dropped a course, now you have to live on the streets\" Who hurt you? :( <eos> ',\n",

Are there ever any left over bikes which I can buy later? I don't think so -- you either have to donate the bike to charity or take it home at the end. Baker's bikes in Urbana specializes in used bikes year around, though. A bit pricey, but the service is top notch. What are grounds for them taking a bike?

The top reply was: [Illini 4000]([url link] [Wildcard Racing]([url link] Lots of links and maps at [UCBikeRide]([url link] I'm old so can't speak for dorm and uiuc specific stuff but there's a pretty active bike community in the area- students, townies, olds. I personally think taking Washington out of Urbana toward Homer Lake is great for a quick ride. [map]([url link] You're only doing about 22 miles there and back, but Homer Lake is really scenic, especially in the fall. Depending on how far west in town you are you might be able to make a longer ride out of it. Former [Illini Cycling]([url link] President here. We have generally been able to arrange some sort of bike storage at somebody's house, but I don't know what that situation will be like this year.  As far as hills, there are a few NW up by Mahomet, but for more, you'll have to ride a bit further out to Kickapoo State Park, or get down by Allerton Park near Monticello.  The wind sucks. Not uncommon in the Spring to have a week straight of 20 mph winds with 40 mph gusts. Send me a message and I can link you to my strava account with a bunch of different routes I've ridden.  Any good hills for it?  Hehe  How much of a factor is the wind? Wind is your only enemy here. Generally roads south of the town are easier to get to from campus.  There is an active road cycling RSO. Find them and you'll be set. Dude, I rode that almost every other day this summer. I probably passed you a time or two. <eos> \",\n",

Not gonna lie, I was kinda hoping it was gonna be one of those [dank pokemon stores]([url link] like they have in Japan It's a classic. Honestly, I've only caught the occasional episode on cable, but they're often pretty great and I've been meaning to watch it in a systematic fashion for a while (ie binging it, or at least watching them in order at a sensible pace).

I was just wondering if this was allowed and if there are any regulations for setting this up. I was astounded that - of all places on-campus - the dorms wouldn't have wifi. The top reply was: The U of I is an engineering university, and many of us know how to hack networks. As an example, I could get on your wifi if I had a day to crack it. Brute-forcing a WEP connection with Backtrack hardly qualifies you as a hacker. You're not allowed to. You'll probably be able to get away with it, though. Use a hidden SSID and encryption, though. And know all of your devices will share a common bandwidth limit. A net tech did a really useful informative post and replied to people in the comments about 2 weeks ago and answered your question along with many others. [url link] Yeah, crack a WPA2 that has a strong password and I'd be impressed I think it's measured by MAC address, so the router has 1 mac address, and any traffic that goes through it is treated as 1 source. If you bypass the router and connect your Xbox, it has another MAC address, and thus will give you another 2gb through that. Also, gaming doesn't use a lot of bandwidth, its the streaming and downloading that will blow your limit. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: There is Am-Ko, Far East, and Chang's Oriental Mart. Not sure if they carry much in terms of what you're looking for. You'll have a hard time finding anything sushi grade in the area. The only place in town I know of that carries sushi grade fish is Cheese and Crackers which is in a strip mall on Kirby and Mattis. I believe they get it in from Chicago every day. The owner is a really friendly guy, I'm sure he'd be happy to tell you the details. As far as other goods, I really like the Green Onion, which is an Asian mart on Neil between Windsor and Kirby. Am-Ko is alright too, but their selection is limited compared to the Green Onion. There's also Green Onion on Neil st, they're pretty good too. Green Onion is mostly Korean. It definitely has frozen sushi-grade fish, fish eggs, I think also eel.  And a big selection of seaweed.  That is where I would start in C-U. Far East is good, but definitely Chinese, so they'll have some helpful goods (esp. vegetables) but not so much the sushi fish and seaweed. There was a newspaper story claiming that Chang's was being forced out of its current location, supposedly to make way for a larger Asian store.  Does anyone know the current state of play there?

And with javascript (they teach you the basics) you lose a lot of the important programming concepts you would learn in 125. If you actually want to learn programming and how computers work, it is a waste of your time. Take 125. If you don't care too much, and just want to graduate, then pick 105. Neither is offered over the summer. What's your major? Thanks for comment. What is the difference between CS 125 and CS 105? So CS 125 is more difficult? 105 is for bus major usually.

Mainly I need an oil change and a diagnostic for everything else (my engine light is on, who knows what that could mean). Any suggestions of where to go and where to avoid? The top reply was: Year? VIN? SSN? Get AutoZone to read off the check-engine code for free. Then likely ignore the check-engine light, depending on what seems to be the problem. Okay, so you don't need to look for anything special for a non-vintage Impala. I think autozone lets you hook up a scanner to your car for free to see whats causing the check engine light. For check engine light- go to autozone, they will run your car's computer for free and then tell you what's wrong with it. You can use this to determine if its worth going to a mechanic or not. If its spark plugs or something, you can do that yourself very easily. Chevy parts are super cheap and domestic economy cars are hella easy to service. Changing your oil, IMO, is worth learning to do yourself to save a bunch of money over time. Not difficult at all. Just advice from a poor person with a shitty car who is learning to fix it all on his own because mechanics are expensive. I've had good luck with Myler. Prices always seem fair and they have a fast turnaround. I've had four different things done their and all repairs solved the given issue the first time and have held up. <eos> \",\n",

At the university my brother attends, he's part of an investing club which has quite a sizeable fund that club members manage. Members meet biweekly and discuss both the club fund and personal investments. Is there anything like this at UIUC? I tried googling this but I only see College of Business stuff. I'm not into finance, investment banking, or even business, really. But I am interested in personal investing. I suppose I'll just look around for an RSO like this on quad day.

I have the slide deck also from the informational I can send if you want Financial Engineering Club Actually, my brother goes to Iowa State University. The fund was created by members who shared some of their gains over the years. There's the Investment Management Academy. It's run by Professor Kevin Waspi (maybe reach out to him at waspi@illinois.edu). They've recently started up and have gathered a million dollars from alumni for the purpose of exactly what you're looking for. I take it your brother goes to CMU? <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: There are barns near campus that clubs/greek houses can rent out and they take buses to get there. No. I have never seen someone get arrested at a barn dance. Before a barn dance, you typically pre-game. After a barn dance, you typically drink more and then fuck someone. Yeah, why not? Girls like to have sex too. If he's asking about an engineering barn dance, disregard everything. You drink two beers and then go home and work on your MP. You typically bring a date that you'd like to fuck. Sometimes you'll end up fucking a random as some people bring dates that are just friends and they wander off. You're in actual barn and you pretty much just drink and drink and drink and everyone else dress like you and you dress like them and then you drink more. People do not get arrested unless you've done something extremely stupid like setting the barn on fire or kill someone. What happens before is you pre-game...hard. People get on the bus and starts puking. Occasionally, you'll see people already blacked out going there or already passed out there. After the barn dance, well you drink more, fuck more, or just passed out. <eos> \",\n",

I don't want to take 4 semesters worth of foreign language when I am already fluent in a language other than English. (Writing is also not a problem)  The top reply was:  IF YOUR LANGUAGE IS NOT LISTED ABOVE:  If you need to take a placement or proficiency exam and your language is not listed above, you may make arrangements to take the NYU exam or the U-Penn exam, if NYU or UPenn offers your language. You will need to contact the Testing Center and make arrangements for them to proctor you while you take the exam. Please note that you are responsible for all proctoring and testing fees. Strong performance on the 12-point NYU exam or the UPenn exam will fulfill Illinois' General Education LOTE requirement.

The top reply was: Haven't studied abroad there, but lived in Singapore for 10 years. Overall, NUS has a pretty good reputation. But prepare to work your ass off. For Singapore in general, **Pros:** -English Speaking (Be sure to use lah!) -Best of the East and the West (Lots of British Influence along with many cool Chinese Temples) -Awesome cuisine (Singaporean Cusine has Malaysian, Chinese and Indian influences. Hit up a Hawker Stall or a Kopi Tiam Coffee Shop! I recommend Roti Prata with a Teh Tarik) -Lots of things to do (Sentosa Island, Orchard Road, Night Safari, Bugis Street) -Drinking and gambling age is 18 (Marina Bay Sands FTW!) -Lots of cool surrounding places (If you are adventurous enough, I highly recommend checking out Johor Bahru)  **Cons:** -If you have to rent a place, its expensive as fuck!  -People can some times be a little rude -Strict as fuck.

I feel like there must be something and I don\\'t want to be the object of social ridicule. Thanks.  The top reply was: Nothing really is stopping you, but it would take a long time. Even if im not printing? Hehe, I actually did just that. I hate buying those bloody lab manuals for like $20 -$60, so for mcb 253 and 428 I checked with TIS if I could return them after they\\'d been taken out of the shrinkwrap, took \\'em home, and sat down and scanned them on my own little scanner while I watched tv online. I like to see it as getting paid $30/hour to watch old episodes of NCIS. Plus it was really nice to never need to bring them anywhere, because I just had the whole manual on my dropbox account. (I did print them out for class, but still made it less of a toll on my back by printing 4 pages/sheet).  A whole textbook\\'s a bit of a serious undertaking though. I\\'d go that route for classes with obnoxiously overpriced \"course booklets\" that you can\\'t return/resell at the end of the semester, and just find other ways of getting cheap textbooks.  (FYI, you can buy newly printed \\'international versions\\' of certain science books for like a quarter the price on ebay. Page numbers and content are EXACTLY the same, but they\\'re usually paperback instead of hardback.) If you could use it, probably takes a bleep ton of time. Every organic chem lab course I\\'ve taught required a breakage card AND a printed lab manual (which has to be purchased separately at the bookstore). <eos> ',\n",

Top tier grad schools? Respectable grad schools? Any grad school? Does taking a job in industry after graduation make GPA any less relevant (i.e. if I get an industry job after I graduate will grad schools place less weight on my undergrad GPA)? I only ask because I have an okay, but not stellar GPA and am considering grad school in the future but don\\'t know if it\\'s worth applying if I can\\'t get into a good school. The top reply was: 5+ years of good work experience makes GPA less important, though not irrelevant, as the GPA is still a predictor of your ability to deliver in an academic environment. Work experience often teaches people to be more effective and efficient students. Showing that you have learned to manage time, approach work with discipline, perhaps work better collaboratively, etc. can help. Often you will be very limited in your ability to disclose the core of your work deliverables due to NDAs so personal projects or leadership examples might also be handy to help show your skills and areas of work. Depends on what grad school, for MS vs PhD, in what field, etc etc. There\\'s nowhere near enough info here to help. Top-tier graduate schools in STEM look for 3.5+, if you\\'re 3.0-3.5 your application will benefit from a PI to stand up for you (most likely by promising to join their lab...). Talk to the head of admissions.  The only thing that matters for grad school is who you know. This is simply not true. Knowing someone within the department is neither necessary nor sufficient for admission to their grad program. Yes, it **helps** to know people in the target department, but it\\'s far from the only thing that matters, or even the most important thing.  Once your funded all the other requirements are mainly just guidelines. This is demonstrably false. I have seen *many* PhD students rejected even though someone was willing to offer them funding. (I\\'ve been on both sides of this process many times.)  Definitely apply, always apply to everything. +1 Depends on the program. Often there are institutional requirements and then there are program specific requirements that often the same or more strict than the institution\\'s. <eos> ',\n",

I could take a look myself (yea I'm in ECE...) but I don't think spending even a minute of finals study hours is a good idea at this point, and even if I find the problem, I don't think I'll come up with any better solution than buying replacement. I know this can be traced back to bunch of different parts from power board to GPU, so I don't think it will be that simple anyway. Long story short, I'm wondering if there's any decent priced repair center in campus area (no Savoy or marketplace). Thanks in advance. The top reply was: [url link] They're in Champaign and seem to be one of the more reliable places on campus. All the others on Neil/Kirby faded away a while ago. If it's a power failure, go to best buy and get a corsair cx700 power supply and just test that. Quick and easy. If it's anything else don't bother and save your time like you said But since it's an alienware prebuilt the PSU might be some off brand piece of shit. Edit: Also simplified computers are a good company. Went there to get some an anti static bag and those guys are actually PC analysts who knew what they were talking about. Unlike geek squad or something. I took my phone to Fyxit on Green street last year and they went over and beyond their obligations for me, so I always recommend them. They also do computers, obviously, but it's the customer service I can recommend. Simplified on Neil Street near Charles - (a couple of blocks south of Green or a couple north of Stadium Drive) has been a long standing good place to go. I do near good things about Fyxit as well but have not used them. I'd suggest ordering a new power supply online and spending 15 min to replace it yourself. If that doesn't fix the problem, then you likely have a significantly more expensive problem. <eos> \",\n",

Group work can definitely be beneficial but for me working on my own without any distractions is by far the most effective. Just gotta find what works for you I guess. Just have to realise that there's no one solution. I try to practice as much as I can. Tbh, I don't like group studying because I am a slow learner. I did try to study in a group this semester but I didn't like it because they were going fast. What are your study habits and how do you study? I've done well by : doing homework and past exams until I can do it without looking at the solution as well. No exceptions. Next, I start writing the procedure/steps for more complex problems and any possible path the question can take. This has worked well. Practice as much as you can, and get a few friends and do problems or question on a board. Get feedback. Look at past materials and aim to gradually study. If there's a will, there's a way. There's no silver bullet, but hard work will pay off in the end. <eos> \",\n",

Half my family is from Palestine and my grandmother is losing her ability to speak English due to Alzheimer's, and I would like to be able to understand her. Any suggestions? The top reply was: Unless I'm wrong UIUC students get free Rosetta Stone access This will almost certainly work in large classes with more than 50 people in them. However, In the limited experience I had in foreign language courses here at UIUC, I don't think this will work too well. The classes are usually very small (20 people or less), require participation, and the instructor will grade you on your level of participation. As a consequence, the instructors will usually learn everyone's name and it would probably be very quickly discovered if you're not on the roster . FYI, I was explicitly told by the Chinese professor that auditing Foreign Language classes is not allowed at UIUC. I approached them about auditing an undergrad Chinese language class as a graduate student. I was told it's not possible, and my best bet was to take it as a credit/no-credit class (e.g., for no letter grade)...which I did. You can just sit in on any lectures. One thing I have noticed is that anyone can go to any lecture and it won’t matter. The professors never check to see that everyone in the lecture is actually in the class. Actually it’s pretty extensive and the library site tells you what won’t be offered. Basically download the app, log in through library site and it opens app and you have full access to 90% of all activities. <eos> \",\n",

The staff has always been pleasant; I’ll give them that. However, that’s hardly enough to counteract the food.  The top reply was: The sauces are a bit hipster-y for me, but the meat has always been decent in my experience, and the sides are nice. Smokeys has better meat and sauce, though their sides suck and the atmosphere is straight up Jolene's Trailer Park. Maybe you and your pals are just barbecue snobs 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️ I mostly agree. I mean, it's good because it's barbecue. But in my limited experience, it's not THAT good relative to other barbecue. Have you taken econ 102 with Dr. Vazquez?

(Please, don't pre-meditate your murders on this subreddit) This has been the most confusing comment I have read all day. Mirror's edge came out in 2008, just fyi. Ask for C-U tricksters at the RSO office. If there are traceurs to be found, they will likely be in league with the twisty kids. Caveat: if you are a representative of a dystopian government building profiles in order to preemptively track freerunners as a form of information control, do not show up. No one will even know that you're dead. Tricking isn't the same as freerunning or parkour, btw.

It's less than $200. That's, like...three visits to a therapist? If you're lucky. You can always hire any doctor/counselor you'd like and pay cash. Just don't expect it to be cheap without insurance.

RSO pages aren't updated often, but what I really want to know is the atmosphere of the club. Is it an exclusive climbingmasterrace clique type club or would they be inclusive for a small skinny dude like myself?  The top reply was: Do it! Not only is the climbing itself an invigorating and motivating experience, but the social club surrounding it (especially at UIUC) is inviting and encouraging. No elitism and an absolute work hard, play hard attitude. Really, it was so easy to be accepted as a beginner. Go climb the wall whenever you have time, introduce yourself and ask the staff for suggestions. It's an instant in. His/her own workload. Everyone in climbing club is super nice and really welcoming to pretty much everyone. Your climbing skills or experience don't matter at all. And there are tons of small skinny dudes like yourself who are in the club (and some of them are really really good climbers). Definitely at least check it out to see if it's your kinda thing. Fantastic group of people. They were one of the major reasons leaving CU hit me right in the feels. You can be a serious tryhard or just someone who wants to climb a bit and hang out. They'll welcome you with open arms. I seriously can't recommend them enough. Went to the first meeting, workload has not given me enough time to follow up past that. They seem pretty nice and willing to help. If you join their Facebook page they have on campus stuff every now and then that would be a good choice if you aren't ready to commit to spending a weekend with them. <eos> \",\n",

Though I have a specific lock on my room, should I be concerned at all? I'm sure burglars are well aware that students are gone and houses are vacant for long periods of time.  The top reply was: Be sure to lock windows as well. I jam a piece of wood in there so they can't open even if they're unlocked. It might be worth it to hide visible valuables. Put your TV and consoles in your closet. So even if someone peeps inside your apartment there won't be anything tempting. Take your valuables home, and make sure the door is locked. Typically a locked door is enough to turn away most thief's, because they're lazy and will hit the easiest targets possible. Take valuables, especially smaller things like laptops, gaming consoles, jewelry, cash, etc. Lock all windows and doors. Unfortunately, many robberies occur over Winter break. Most importantly, GET RENTERS INSURANCE!!! Around $100/year will cover your stuff if it gets stolen, burns in a fire, gets wrecked from the jerk upstairs who didn't leave his heat on and broke his water pipes, the drunk idiot who vomits and then urinates on your brand new laptop, etc. Any insurance company you'd recommend? Also, what's the overall process of getting renter's insurance? If you have a car, your car insurance company will usually sell renters insurance as well and bundle them for a discount (not much since renters is cheap anyways) and it will be easier to pay bills, etc <eos> \",\n",

I lived there when I transferred and it was a great way to meet people who are in a similar situation as you are. You also get the \"freshman experience\" of living in a dorm with a roommate.

Its more business/humanities majors. also highly recommend transfer cluster. lived there before it was moved to Scott hall due to high demand. there were also a number a ppl who were engineering students in transfer cluster. would be farther walk to engineering quad than ISR, but more much of a social scene in six pack  [url link] <eos> ',\n",

I am a bit nervous for my GPA since it was 3.4 with my minor as Math but I finished all pre-requiste.  Like any graduate school application, probably the most important part for admission is strong reference letter, but I guess I don't really have good reference letter.  Being that said,,, I was just wondering how the general practice of admission for incoming new students? (Is it relatively easy as long as you are fulfilled with all pre requiste or is it more like based on really finest applicants out of all applicants like Ph D?)

I mainly planning on driving from my house to Grainger or possibly the mall if that makes a difference. The top reply was: [Here]([url link] is a campus parking map. (FYI its very hard to use/read but helpful.) [The giant parking map \\\\[pdf\\\\]]([url link] I'm pretty sure for scooters you need to have a parking permit. All the athletes that have scooters have premits on their license plates. So I guess a good rule of thumb would be if you have a license plate, you need a permit. For on campus parking for a scooter, if it's got a big enough engine that you need a motorcycle endorsement on your license then you'll need to buy a motorcycle permit if you want to park in the designated parking in campus lots. They're $68 dollars. If it's below 50cc you can probably stick it in a bike rack, but I'm not sure. And that seems to annoy people for some reason anyway (or at least one person I know was pretty vocal about it). Off campus, it's just like anywhere else. It annoys me that they have double standards between motorcycles and scooters, when scooters take up essentially the same amount of space. <eos> \",\n",

Is anyone with an allergy aware of restaurants that either do not use peanut oil or will accommodate a peanut allergy? The top reply was: I don't think any of the places on campus are worth trying risking your own damn health. If you have Chinese friends maybe you can ask them for a homemade dinner invite. They do it all the time and I have not seen a single peanut being used they do can avoid certain ingredients if you ask, but theres no reason for you to risk your life. Many cook with peanut oil, as it is a relatively high smoke point oil. Rainbow garden may be a good place because the servers are very fluent in English and probably can understand your needs. Plus the food is very good. To be honest not that much Chinese dishes has peanuts in them. There’s literally a travel advisory warning people not to go the sort of “big cities” in America in case they get murdered...... you can say shitty and irresponsible things like those. I can also say this kind of things. Have you ever been to China？ If your answer is no. Then do not say another word. You can only have your opinion on things that you have actually tried and experienced. How about I buy you a ticket this summer from Chicago to whichever city you would like to visit in China?

Ken (the owner) is a pretty great guy and the facilities are awesome. My dog enjoyed going there a lot to the point where asking him if he wants to go to daycare gets a bigger reaction than going to the walk or to the park. I highly recommend them. Also used dog den. It looks sketchy on the outside due to the location. It was a good experience, the other dogs seemed really happy there! My dog is a big special baby and the worker said she didn't leave her kennel to play at all until I showed up to pick her up. But that's how she is when I'm not around. The place itself was fine. Crossroads on Cunningham is a great daycare! Thank you for responding! I'm glad your dog enjoyed going there so much :). I will definitely be thinking about taking our dog there! <eos> \",\n",

One is south of the Law Buildings just east of the football stadium. Dates back to mid 1800's. The second is on St. Mary Road just next to the Rail Road tracks. Again an old one. The third is north of Christal Lake Park and Busey woods - Busey woods is another good place to walk. The cemetery is on Coler Ave. If you have a car (rails to trails route is not yet done) you can go to Homer Lake - east of Urbana about 8 miles. Or Lake of The Woods Park (big park) which is near Mahomet and it is 10 miles west of town off Bloomington road. If you are a good biker all of these are easy rides.  Further afileld to the east near Danvile is Kickapoo with canoes and trails. Campus: The Arboretum. Near campus: Meadowbrook Park. Outside C-U but nearby: Allerton Park. Homer Lake. Kickapoo.

You will manage time better, have lower anxiety about the clas as you will know much of the ground work material, seek and obtain help often and earlier, look at each problem from new vantage points and improve across the board. It may not be something you are stellar at but you will do better second time around. I doubt youll fail it. They curve pretty well. Edit: although with that said I feel like youll learn a lot more abd coke out with a different perspective if you did well on the mps (1 and 2 are on you, 3 kinda is also). Try your best on the final. Study as much as you can and try to get feedback on it from friends or course staff. Maybe you won\\'t get an \"ideal\" grade in the class, but I think you\\'d rather that then fail it outright. Make it your mission not to fail and do whatever you can to complete it. You maybe made mistakes in the past, but you still have time to learn from them. <eos> ',\n",

Sorry if this is rude or \"homeless-shaming\". I just was wondering and assume other people have the same question. The top reply was: it is doubtful she is homeless, just very eccentric. She does not ask for money, doesn\\'t bother people. Probably the biggest complaint that could be made about her is that her hygiene may not be 100%, but the same could be said of some students... Oh, that’s “Calypso”. She’s been around for years. Not sure what her real name is. I do have this same question. I don\\'t find your post to be rude. It\\'s curiosity. She could be an ECE major.

Is this the appropriate thing to do? What are the repercussions for a situation like this?  The top reply was: Admitting it will likely reduce the punishment. Depending on the details, an instructor could give an F for the class and recommend dismissal from the University. Or it could just be a written apology that goes in your student record. [url link] I think it would be best for that person to admit it and apologize. They have all of the proof they need, so if your friend lies to their faces, they won't go easy on him/her. I was in a class where the professor caught someone cheating. He was angry and made the student turn over the iClickers as well as his iCard and told him to get out of class.  My professor said that he will fail any students caught cheating and write a letter to put on file on their student records. I'm not sure what he did in this scenario, but I don't think he just dismissed it. Report it to Phyllis Wyse <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Almost every bar doesn\\'t have cover on Wednesdays, that\\'s why most bar crawls are on Wednesdays. I\\'m sorry if it must be on a certain date but as someone who has planned bar crawls, do it on a Wednesday.  To answer your question, most bars do/don\\'t charge cover based on how full it is. If there are only 5 people inside, would you pay $5? There\\'s no set time that cover starts. But based purely off popularity and history, there\\'s gonna be cover if you aren\\'t there by 10. There\\'s always cover at Cly\\'s on Tuesdays, if you get there before the crowd like at 9ish the chance of cover is slim. if you go after 11 you\\'ll have to pay. there\\'s no way to know when cover starts, just depends on the bouncer and the number of people out. It might be a \"free before a certain time\" thing. I would call and check or maybe check their fb page.

I play once in a while so I'm not terrible but not really good either. Feel free to pm me If only I was still on campus... Sometimes the tennis club practices at the Urbana courts so you have to wait until they're done. Other then that its free game.

Ah shoot I'd love to play but I didn't bring my shoes or my racket. I also haven't played in a few years, so I'm kinda meh. Also I think you can just walk on the courts.

Many ways, certainly by train Blue and Yellow lines will take you to the Illinois Terminal. Amtrak departs upstairs in the terminal. Hop on the 1N Yellow at Ikenberry Commons.

I’m a UIUC ECE alum asking for my daughter who has to decide on where to go for college. She was admitted to a UIUC CS+ program, but she was also admitted to a different college where she can double major in both CS and the “+” separately, and she worries the UIUC CS+ degree will restrict her job choices. Thanks!! Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies- I think we have a new Illini at our house!! The top reply was: Only thing that restricts the job choices is the person, not the degree. I'm a senior CS + Linguistics. Currently have a job at research park doing NLP and python/bash coding, but I've decided not to go into computational linguistics as a career. Instead, I have a systems internship lined up this summer now. But my other friend who's also CS + Ling has a full time offer from Microsoft doing NLP working on Cortona. It's really up to the individual and their skillset.   The great part about CS + X is, you're qualified for any CS job a CS ENG is qualified for (it's true, get over it) or you can directly specialize in the +X field. *it's true, get over it* Grow up.  LAS Physics vs Engineering Physics - no practical difference. I don't have to take 326 and that's all that matters to me <eos> \",\n",

The CU credit union one doesn't charge a fee, there is another one in Grainger on the ground floor.

The professor explicitly put on the assignment that no late finals will be accepted without documentation of a medical emergency, so that's what I need?  The above post is her situation.  The top reply was: Email professor and explain and hope for forgiveness and leniency. Don't make up a medical excuse. The truth will come out easily and it makes it more difficult for everyone. Maybe email prof. and beg for forgiveness? GG otherwise 11 PM is a weird deadline...can she ask an advisor about it first explaining the situation before asking the professor? An advisor may have a little more power in possibly convincing the professor to accept it which is why I recommend going to them first. Talk to the professor or TA. Maybe your friend can salvage at least half her final exam grade, or some other accommodation offered by the professor. I'm sure she had the means to look up what time the deadline was for handing in her final. Whether or not she took advantage of that, that's on her.  On my own personal note, Email the professor and beg for forgiveness, and accept responsibility for your actions, is all you can really do. I had an online class through the OCE and managed to hand in my final 10 minutes late because I ran into a computer issue, my fault that I waited until the very last minute to try and hand it in. I emailed my professor and begged, but also included in the email that I had made a mistake and while it was a mistake that I understood that she was in no way obligated to help me and that if I was to get a zero that I did understand that that was the consequence to my actions.  Did I have an anxiety attack over it? You bet. Did I sleep that night? No. I got an email bright in early the next day, that she understood and hoped that I learned my lesson, and that accidents happen, but in the future to start the handing in process about a half hour before due dates so just in case a computer issue were to happen again. <eos> \",\n",

So for Fall 2015, looks like we have Professor Han Ye for BADM 374, and Professor Youngsoo Kim for BADM 375. How are they? Any comments will be appreciated. The top reply was: I've taken both. What are you looking for in a class? 374 is mainly focusing on logistics of figuring out the cheapest cost or maximizing profits of various supply or logistics networks. 375 is mainly focused on operations and how long processes will take and how much it will cost the company. Let me know if you have any questions. I have not either of these classes. BADM 375 with Agrawal was a great class, but it was very much so because Agrawal was a fantastic instructor. It's project management stuff, lots of timelines and cost prediction. I've taken both. Both classes kind of build off of each other in the sense that the concepts are very similar. I haven't had either of those professors but both classes were very excel oriented with using solver to solve the equations. They were both extremely easy once you get the hang of using solver and formulating the problems. I am just worried that both of them have not so great ratings on ratemyprofessors.com from their previous institutions... Han Ye - U of NC, Youngsoo Kim - can't remember... Youngsoo Kim is a Phd student. As a general rule, take a professor. Agrawal is great, but he told us the last time he will not be teaching 375 any more. Han is new, no idea. <eos> \",\n",

Edit: Turned it in to Grainger lost  found The top reply was: Not sure if this will help at all, but the brand is Kryptonite Most bike locks on campus are probably Kryptonites. Unfortunately, I doubt the owner knows what their serial number for the lock is.  SS indicates its a disc lock, which most of the Kryptonites on campus are, from the shitty Keepers to the nice New York locks (but, the new york locks and probably some of their other higher end locks don't have the serial stamped on them).  Dropping it off at the grainger desk if they have a lost and found or with the police is probably a better idea than posting it on reddit, given that Kryptonite at least used to just require the serial number for replacement keys (not that someone would necessarily order a key, try it on all Kryptonite locks near Grainger and steal a bike -- a hacksaw or angle grinder would be way faster and more discrete...). OK, I agree with you. I'll do that later today because I'm in the middle of something right now. Well, my lock came with 2 keys, so it's possible the owner still has the other one and can find the serial number. <eos> \",\n",

They aren't helping them, and these people prey on the kind-hearted, young and inexperienced who just want to help them. Giving them money doesn't help.

The top reply was: been dying to try it You probably will die trying it In store its on a board behind the counter, not on the printed menus you can pick up. That might be why it’s not on there. There is a different menu in the restaurant. Also some menu items are not in English. Try the sizzling chicken pot sometime. Trichinosis only requires once, in the food poisoning Russian roulette that is Cravings. Ate it roughly once every week. Never had food poisoning or stomach problems from it.

Besides the regular sliding around campus (off the top of my head, jimmy johns, cravings, walgreens, and quadshop in union), the biggest things I've done in the last few days is I've set up my thanksgiving transportation. I've set up rides with amtrak, megabus, and LEX.  Now, I remember there was a thread on this about a year ago, but I'm posting this again, partially to remind people to check their statements, but also because I'd like some sort of inkling as to where it went wrong. Personally, I've got a sneaking suspicion it was LEX. The top reply was: They are not checking their own scores. They are checking the scores of stolen ids. Had this happen to me as well, had to get 4 charges adjusted from my credit card that went unnoticed. I, too, have ridden with LEX and they are already a really shady, illegitimate company so I have a big feeling you're correct. There was a [thread]([url link] about this some time back, and someone suggested that EatCU was to blame. I have both ridden LEX and ordered from EatCU, so I am not sure who is responsible for those charges on my credit card bill. Yeah, just had this happen to me. Fixed it a couple days ago, TCF told me they suspect LEX had been hacked or something. But I've never ridden with LEX or even been to their site, so I don't know what's up. But TCF also told me it's happening with a lot of people recently. I've had this happen to me. It's LEX...well technically. LEX isn't the one that's actually charging extra, but their website is really insecure and people are able to obtain your credit card number via it.

At least I wanna know how much each one costs because they are all priced differently. 1. BBQ (sandwiches, nachos, fries, etc); Mac n Cheese (plain option and meat added options); Chicken and Waffles (or the option for one or the other); Grilled Cheese (a few varieties)  2. $4-7 per entree 3. I’ve found several here whose food I like, but it seems their price point or wait time is really off in regards to what I’m used to elsewhere.  4. Cracked: Takes too long to get the food. I love the food, but if there are two people ahead of you in line, you’re probably looking at a 15-minute wait. And the place they park always is positioned where the ordering area is muddy as hell.  5. ApplePay for sure. I’ve never seen any that use Venmo or Cash App, but I don’t see why added convenience or flexibility would ever be a bad thing. <eos> ',\n",

Through the lens of families impacted by the mass shootings in Newtown, Aurora, Isla Vista and Tucson, as well as those who experience daily gun violence in Chicago, the documentary looks at why politicians are finding it difficult to act and what is being done at the state and local levels. The film is executive produced and narrated by Katie Couric and directed by Stephanie Soechtig.

However, I do want to know is it possible to be be in a sorority, play a club sport, have a job, and still get good grades. Is that too much on my plate? Is that also a lot of dues to pay? How many activities do students usually participate in? The top reply was: No, but its fun to listen to kids talk about their dreams. How many minors do you plan on getting? Yeah, about that, unless you possibly want 0 sleep, dont do all this extra stuff. Take care of your health and make sure you know your limits. Depends on your major, but my advice is not to go overboard your first year and work your way up, not work your way down. A sorority, club sport, and a job will all be incredibly taxing regardless of your major just because of the time commitment involved. Most jobs on campus like for you to work about 8 hours minimum. Sororities have lots of events and during the rush process, you'll barely even have any time to yourself. Afterwards, unless you're involved with any positions in said sorority, it will most likely not reach that same busy level but still.  Like many people would say, having a good GPA is way better than putting your sorority and your sport on a resume, cause let's face it, companies and employers arent colleges and sometimes couldnt care less about these unless you've had a leadership position. Even then, if you're say in CompE, most companies hiring computer engineers want to see projects instead of a sorority. You're a student before an athlete, a sister, and an employee. Remember that. I'd reconsider that minor in shitposting Here's the thing: It depends on your major, the sport, the sorority, the job... I technically am a CS major with a minor, who is in a sorority, has two jobs, used to be in a club sport, and gets good grades. But I choose carefully -- and if I need to I'll ditch activities in favor of classes. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was:  4 seasons . . .per month. Austin is a city setting while CU is a college town, so it depends on what kind of lifestyle you want/plan to have during college. Apparently you've never been to Franklin, Tennessee. In complete seriousness: Your mental health is *far* more important than the institution listed on your diploma, or your major, or your job prospects, or your finances.

There's tons of coffee shops, bars, restaurants in the green street area as well as downtown Champaign and Urbana.

The bottom line is even though we're not in a big city, there's 40000 students here, so there's bound to be plenty to do and plenty of people to meet. <eos> \",\n",

IME, people won't avoid responding to you if they don't want to write you a letter. Is there any reason you think that's the case? <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: The difference between the Piazza and Moodle averages is due to at least one of two factors: 1) Moodle lies, because it's terribly written 2) The average is computed after tossing out [scores over 90% or below 33]([url link] (the same policy is in effect [this semester]([url link] The letter grades were computed by downloading the grades from Moodle and redoing the calculations by Excel. Source: was 374 TA last semester Average: 47.5 (out of 80) Standard dev: 14.5  They never officially announced cutoffs last semester that I can recall, but the average grade was a B- and the average Course Total was 68.97. I think it tends to vary by each semester and the difficulty of homeworks/exams - you can find some other cutoffs on Jeff's old course pages as well. Edit: The reported average on Piazza was the above 47.5. On Moodle, (where the average grade and course total were taken from), the average on the exam was a 45.48 points out of 80). The top 64/375 got an A or A+ if that helps at all. They never said exactly what percent that corresponded to but by reverse engineering, it would be somewhere around an 81. Edit: Actually there is a scale on Piazza for Spring, I'll see if I can find Fall which is what I was talking about above (I didn't take it in the Spring).  90   A+ 83.72 A 79.59 A- 75.28 B+ 71.07 B 67.25 B- 63.42 C+ 59.36 C 55.23 C- 51.09 D+ 46.95 D 41.31 D- &lt; 41.31 F Thank you /u/IDontLikeChipotle /u/plin25 /u/ECEPerson I got a 64% raw score which got curved to a B-. <eos> \",\n",

Is it actually important? The top reply was: Idk if I’m going too far by saying that’s completely wrong but I’m going to say it is. I can’t stress how much a GOOD partner is worth in 385. I’m willing to bet you had a bad experience. Splitting the labs were not hard at all and having a partner was invaluable to me because of how much time it saved. A bad partner on the other hand, well ya know... Yeah it’s really important imo. Also if you can’t find one before hand you can post on their wiki later on or find one in your lab section. Just hope you find someone you know and will work well with. How detailed your reports have to be depends a lot on your TA. If your TA is lenient then you won’t have to be super detailed. The lab isn't that bad for most weeks but the reports can be a huge pain since it is a big chunk of your grade and you have to be pretty detailed on it Idk if you are counting in all the time teamwork takes. Cuz like i could wakeup and do verilog in my bed lol so the great ease at which i could start and stop saved a lot of time imo. <eos> \",\n",

Live Action Games, also in downtown Champaign, might also be able to help you. The name gives it away but they only deal in video game stuff and have a bigger selection than Exile.

While waiting for the bus, the offender, who identified himself as “Robert,” approached the victim and tried to engage her in conversation. The offender then shoved the victim, grabbed her purse, and ran. The victim chased the offender and he dropped the purse after he slipped and fell near the Vivarium Building (606 E. Healey Street, Champaign). The victim then kicked the offender in the face. The offender was last seen running northbound. I fucking love this chick. The top reply was: Badass chick but damn lucky that chase didn\\'t end in her getting shot/stabbed. You never know with people...but fucking badass nonetheless!

Is anyone else in the same boat as me. Also how does she still teach the class, for the past 3 years it seems that basically nobody liked her?

I went to the career fairs and to the career center, but nothing came out of it. The top reply was: In the workforce now but I was in your position as a student, the last 2 years of college I spent a lot of time stressing about job opportunities and the fear of getting nothing. I did manage to find a job I love (and now I come back to recruit at UIUC!) while in school so that was a success, but after much stress. A reminder I wish folks had emphasized with me: Your dream job doesn't have to, and likely won't, be the first job you get out of college. So you're doing the right thing applying for everything under the sun. But a lot of folks around here might be in positions a couple of my friends were in, where they wouldn't even consider jobs unless it somehow led to their dream. Keep applying and interviewing, remember the rejections aren't a personal attack on your character though they do feel like it, follow up with interviews, and stretch your location/industry preferences. You won't miss your dream job straight out of college; you're still preparing for it. Corporate spyware for kids: [url link] Same tbh. I shot my shot at big/medium name companies/firms and nothing.

The top reply was: I usually take the Greyhound Be aware that Greyhound is not always reliable so don't be surprised if the bus is delayed by half an hour up to over an hour. I went to St. Louis a good amount of times last year and always took the Greyhound. Try and take the 1:30pm on Friday as it is the express bus and will get you there in 3h rather than the normal 3h40m. I'd say it's a hair better than Amtrak for on-time percentage, but they're neck and neck. Apparently, if you sign up for their Road Rewards program (free), they give you a 10% coupon.

The top reply was: thank you for your help They cannot email you your grade. Ask instead to make an appointment at their convenience. I hope this wasn't for an English class... That might be possible. Under FERPA guidelines, email is considered unsecured (even University email and those sent through Compass) so professors are not allowed to email grades.

Also how many exams are there in 232? And how many in 233? Does 232/233 have a late-bloomer policy? Thanks in advance!  The top reply was: I took them last semester! CHEM 233 is pretty standard. Similar to 103/105 but more deadlines for Pre-Lab and Post-Lab Quizzes. Feels really tedious at first. I'm not sure about other TAs, but I do feel my TA was a bit inconsistent with his/her grading.  For 232, there are both online and in-class discussions. The content is presented via YouTube videos that are linked to through Compass. The idea is to watch these before the discussions. I was in the online discussion and we were told we were welcome to also go to the in-class discussions. I never did anything other than the online. Also, the onlines are not for any type of credit/points, so you can go as you please. The webcasts are recorded for every discussion so you can go watch if you didn't go at the assigned time. I used this often early on, but eventually finished the semester going to every one at the assigned time to really get ready for the final - which was my best test grade of the class! There is a late-bloomer policy and I, myself, benefited from it. It made almost a whole letter grade of difference.  I definitely enjoyed both classes, although I wish my 233 grade would have been higher. GLHF CHEM 233, hated that class! Whoever decided to make 232 online is on par with the Devil Three midterms in 232 plus the final. Lab practical for 233 which is a final in lab form as well as a short written part going over reactions you worked with in the labs. Thanks!

              " '<bos> I’m currently a freshman in Undecided, and I’m considering transferring into Physics, and I have a few questions: What’s the difference between being in LAS and Engineering physics career-wise?(I’ve been told by many both are extremely similar). In general, what’s the best career to get with a degree in physics, as I have heard that you can get a career in Finance with a physics degree. What classes aside from physics and math are good to take in the major?  The top reply was: Friend of mine is doing his PhD in computation physics at UWM. He\\'s currently applying at AMD, Intel, and 3M. I think most of these companies want things to work fast, and if you have a history of getting things working fast, that can definitely play in your favor. So Physics PhD’s are usually the ones working in finance. It’s usually only doable as an undergrad if you’re the MIT/Harvard type to do what physics/math people do in finance. If you have a CS background you may have a shot at doing software dev stuff for those companies. I could be wrong, but most of the quant finance companies that come here are usually only interested in CS/ECE majors, not Math and Physics. This is why I think software finance roles are more likely than the trading/quant stuff you see math/stat/phys people do. Like what CS should I take up to? I have credit for 125 so I’m probably doing 173 though I heard the class sucks and it’s better to place out of it. Difference between LAS and Engineering career-wise: In career fairs, some employers love to see the \"engineering\" but other than that no true benefit. That said it is very easy to internally transfer if you feel the need to do so. Physics is a great pre-professional degree to have, depending on what you focus on you can cultivate the skills from jobs ranging from materials manufacturing, semiconductor electronics, software development and finance and data analysis. Other than physics and math the most useful classes to take are CS and statistics. The level to which you take it is entirely upon you. Would strongly recommend having an understanding of data structures though <eos> ',\n",

Living in Chicago, I have to drive 2.5 hours down, pack up a year\\'s worth of shit, drive 2.5 hours back, hang onto my shit for a week, and then drive it back down. What kind of sadistic bullshit is this? It is my understanding that all the agencies have essentially the same move-out and move-in days, and everyone I know has to do the same thing. Why couldn\\'t they just arrange it so students could keep their stuff down there, and just move it from one apartment to another when they change apartments?  Any insight into this would be appreciated.  The top reply was: Yeah it sucks but they need the time to prep it for the next tenant. Having similar move in and move out days probably makes it easier across the board. Also you can look for storage places to put your stuff. It surprises me there aren\\'t some big ones on campus(Christ so many people would be all over it but I guess one month aint good business.)  Basically try to find a place you can stay in more more then one year.. I think it\\'s due to the fact that they need the time to inspect each apartment and do some housecleaning/repairs. For example, it takes Bankier ~2 days per apartment unit to clean the carpets, re-paint the walls and fix bits and pieces of the apartment. Summer session ends on right around the 8th of August, so it gives tenants time to pack their shit and move out. Fall semester starts the 22nd so the move-in day on the 19th gives the tenants time to settle in before school beings full-swing.

I don't currently have a bike and in light of my stated interests I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations of places to get a bike in or around Champaign-Urbana. Thanks! The top reply was: I wouldn't buy one new, that's for sure. Check out craigslist first, then start looking at local shops (Baker's Bikes, the campus Bike Project) that sell good, used bikes. The guys at the corner at 201 N Busey (actually, their garage on Stoughton) fix up and sell bikes. That's where I got mine and I'm really happy with it. $200 for a great bike that's had no problems, and they gave me free maintenance for life. Word of advice: lock your bike well, and even then, don't leave it on campus over a weekend _&lt; The places FruitSwoops mentioned are good. I would also recommend Bikeworks for quality used bikes, as well as repair. The guy who runs it is a bit of a curmudgeon, but he really knows what he's doing and doesn't overcharge. Whatever you do, do not go to Durst Cycle. I got mine at Baker's Bikes. Friendly service. I went in and chose a bike, they sized me then built it. About 40 minutes later (IIRC) they finished and let me test ride it on the street. When I went in the cheapest they had was $300 for a new one. Works well, haven't had any problems besides ones I've caused myself. I have yet to go back to the shop about looking at my bike, so I can't say about repairs and the like. Sorry if you already know this, but be sure to get a good U-lock if you're buying anything $80+. Bike thieves are rampant here on campus. They'll also steal the tires too if they're nice enough; lock em up! <eos> \",\n",
              " '<bos> This woman drove up to me at around 3am and asked me for some cash, saying her fiancé just broke up with her and she had 3 kids she needed money for. Feeling bad I gave her 10 dollars. After she left pretty quickly leaving me feeling pretty stupid. Did I just get scammed? Did she approach anyone else with the same story? I\\'m really confused. The top reply was: At 3 am you\\'re lucky she didn\\'t ask you for your whole wallet. Probably. And showing that you have money on you can put you in danger (she could have come back with a friend or produced a weapon). In the future, I would avoid this kind of situation, especially at that lonely hour. But, you are a kind person and that is a wonderful thing. Yeah, you most likely got scammed. Don\\'t feel bad; just means you care. Live and learn. Most likely she was looking for drug money. Many years ago, I learned my lesson when a guy came up to me at 3 a.m. at the CVS parking lot at Green and Neil begging for money for a car repair or some such emergency. I told him no at first, then decided to be nice while I was inside and got $20 cash back and gave it to him. He was ecstatic and told me I\\'d never pay for anything at his parents\\' dry-cleaning place. I should have realized his manic demeanor wasn\\'t anxiety over his \"plight\" but the last remnants of the coke binge he was on. It happens. Consider yourself initiated; you just earned some authentic townie points! Is the one guy trying to get gas to get to the Methodist church in Rantoul still there? I only gave him five but my buddy was so taken with the story, he gave him his day\\'s take home from Papa Dels that night: $70. Not Rantoul.. Danville. I saw him this summer a couple of times off campus. <eos> ',\n",

What do I need to know going into this? Should I have a best-case-scenario class schedule planned? Do I need to sprint to any specific people/kiosks to talk to before anyone else? Or is this less of a race to book course seats than I think it will be? I'm transferring into the CS program-- any specific details that pertain to that? Thanks to anyone who can help. The top reply was: I'm pretty sure that they reserve spots for incoming transfers in the popular required CS classes that first semester transfers are likely to take (like CS 225 for example). Have a plan, at least. Courses, their CRNs and probably an alternate schedule or 2.  I’m not sure if you’re going to use the new registration (enhanced registration) or the classic system. If it’s like what I did when I was Freshman, you log into self service hit “register for classes” and then select the term and type all the CRNs then hit “submit” it then registers you for every class that you put if it’s open.  It’s not really a race, it’s just hard to get classes especially with a late time ticket. This is even more true for CS classes since there’s a lot of people in CS, and ECE people want to take CS classes too not to mention everyone else that just wants to take a CS class. That makes sense. <eos> \",\n",

We know what you\\'re actually going to write because that\\'s your actual degree. What happens if someone actually calls and verifies your degree? They confirm you have a degree in Economics.

But sometimes i randomly get homesick like today while i was a standing in a overpacked bus i just missed car rides with my dad. And, as much as I love my days starting at 11 now I still kinda miss waking up at 6 and eating breakfast with my family. I wasn't one of those kids who craved independence, honestly i feared it. I have a good amount of friends here its just sometimes i miss the people who i lived with for a majority of my life and it hits me really hard especially at night The top reply was: I feel the exact opposite - being home for longer than a week or so starts to suck and I'm even considering a trip with an RSO instead of going home for spring break (mandatory to move out in dorms). I've only gone home on the mandatory breaks we have and even that felt excessive. I call my parents fairly often, but never really feel a _strong_ yearn to go home. [Not an issue when you don't have friends.]([url link] Nothing wrong with feeling that way now and then. Perhaps write about it in a personal diary to just let the feelings out rather than keep them in. Your home is with you forever. Your family is in you forever. You are here in part because your home and family launched you into this phase of your life. Touch here and now - both the people and places - with your family and home via your life her. You will feel less of this as you get older I hope and imagine but the fact is they and the place will always be in you and the way you are will be a reflection of those first 18 years. Why don't you like being home? For me that's where all my friends are and we just hang out all the time when we're back. International students: yeah i wonder what that feels like. <eos> \",\n",

I applied and was wondering if anyone here has applied or applied last year and knows when we will hear back. Also I applied for the AB InBev Scholarship and was wondering the same thing. Thanks for any help! The top reply was: I actually applied for both, so I think I can give some insight. AB InBev Really cool scholarship opportunity. They select 5 or so finalists and then you have a meeting with some c-level execs from AB InBev. They tell you if you\\'re a finalist at the start of the semester. I was a finalist but someone else ended up getting the scholarship. Triangle It\\'s an opportunity to live at the Triangle house instead of a dorm, which saves a good amount of money. I think sometime in July, you get an email saying they want to interview you to see if you match the culture they are looking for. You get a response not too long after that. (just to keep in mind) When living in a frat house for a \"scholarship\" like that, there is a strong expectation that you join that house. Not saying that is good or bad, but something to be aware of. Awesome! Thanks <eos> ',\n",

[\"The Beginning of the End\"]([url link] is not one of the best known episodes, so I had to go to great lengths to find it at one point, but did, just because the first half of the movie is all in the Champaign-Urbana area. It\\'s on Netflix now, so if you ever wanted to see it, now is the time! The top reply was: The original movie. At the beginning of the movie, the town of Ludlow is suddenly gone in one night. The buildings are destroyed, and the people are gone without a trace. Urbana cops come in and barricade all entrances. One of the main characters is an entomologist at U of I. Since \"insects and vegetables are very similar in structure\", he\\'s busy making giant tomatoes using radioactive chemicals. Apparently the heat from the radiation is able to double or triple photosynthesis, and makes the tomatoes grow so that they are 200-300 lbs in size.  But, apparently what worked on the vegetables did affect the insects. They eventually find an elevator full of grain, and quickly became 30-50 feet long! They are responsible for the missing town of Ludlow, and are now marching towards Chicago! There may be parts of the movie that were shot here, but most of it was shot in California. There\\'s several scenes with the \"mountains of Illinois\" in the background. Urbana also gets a mention in the Futurama episode \"Calculon 2.0,\" also on Netflix. Ah, yes. The infamous Homework Mountains of Illinois. And for MST3K in general: [url link] IS the MST3K in champaign, or the original movei? <eos> ',\n",

The built-in OSX client (and VPNC on Linux) uses the older IPSec. Just download the client, it is not too ugly and is much easier to service and support. No, that is not possible. The new version of the VPN does not like any other clients even the built in ones. The IPSec VPN servers got phased out a while ago. You have to use the AnyConnect client now. as /u/dfernandes mentioned, it won't be compatible and is a surprisingly very easy to use tool. <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Hi, I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering and I'm considering doing a Masters in CS or CompE. I was wondering how competitive are those programs? I know Masters programs are more competitive than undergrad but I was wondering since CS has been getting tougher to get into over the past few years, whether the MS in CS program has gotten tougher to get into as well. Thanks :) The top reply was:  less competitive than undergraduate Really? Last year, CS got 3500 undergrad applicants and offered admission to about 800. In the same year CS got 1200 MS applicants and we offered admission to just under 100. Ehh the 5 year program isn't that competitive. I heard that 15/16 applicants got in two years ago. At least for CS, getting into MS is more competitive than undergrad. Nevertheless, if you have a good GPA (= 3.5) you should have a chance. If you have glowing recommendation letters from faculty+research experience+published research papers, your chances dramatically improve, and the GPA becomes somewhat less important.  You can also consider MCS - it is less prestigious than MS, but it is easier to get into. However, you need to pay tuition... (MS students are usually fully funded either from TA or RAship). Everybody is funded, even for MS. The department always needs more teaching assistants. This makes me feel slightly special. <eos> \",\n",

I was late in registering for the following courses and would appreciate if anyone can give me an insight to get on the course waitlist.  ECE 470 Introduction to Robotics- Seth Hutchinson CS 425 (Distributed Systems)- Indranil Gupta CS 440 (Artificial Intelligence)- Johnson, Lazebnik CS 446 (Machine Learning) Also, if anyone knows whom to directly contact for waitlist/spot info, that would be great! I have emailed all the professors and most suggest I should wait for someone to drop the class, as they can\\'t override it. P.S - I only plan to take 1/2 courses out of the list depending upon where I get a spot. The top reply was: AFAIK they stopped using waitlists in CS. You\\'ll just have to wait and see, just as the professors are telling you.  Professors usually start their own waitlist when the semester begins \"Usually\" is a bit optimistic. Some professors do run their own waitlists, but I think we\\'re a minority. The only \"official\" method is to check back frequently for an open spot. Banner/Enterprise will not tell you, and does not support waitlists (which is the whole reason why there aren\\'t any elsewhere; they\\'re unwieldy to handle without real support since Banner will just let someone in when the spot appears rather than waiting). I think you can still register over the summer, but I usually don\\'t check. I don\\'t know any specific statistics, but you\\'ve listed some very popular classes, so I can\\'t say they\\'ll be pleasant. Professors usually start their own waitlist when the semester begins. All the classes you mentioned above have high turnover rates from my experience except ECE 470. For example CS 446 was able to register about 40-80 previously unenrolled students due to the high drop rate. Will I see on enterprise? or do I need to wait for the semester to begin? Also, what\\'s the general statistics of people getting a spot once the semester starts? <eos> ',\n",

Thoughts? The top reply was: Yes. Then put it on the sidebar. Also, if you for whatever reason no longer need to hunt, delete or edit out the comment. someone correct me if I'm wrong. It would be easy to actually make the sub, but I'm guessing mods do not want to use up server space for a sub that will not have a lot of traffic. I see no reason why you can't just start a new thread in r/uiuc.  As you said, we're a small community and thus far I have only seen 3 or 4 threads pertaining to living situations this semester.

The top reply was: Parkland Community College Realize, as with many schools, who Illinois considers its rivals is different from whether those \"rivals\" consider Illinois a rival. And so I would say it\\'s not a rivalry unless both schools agree. Michigan and Ohio State is a rivalry. But Michigan couldn\\'t care less about Illinois. No That\\'s a tough question...I\\'ve grown up as a crazy Illinois fan raised by crazy Illinois fans, but nobody really sticks out to me *that* much as our \"rival\", especially with football. With basketball, our biggest rivals would probably be Missouri and Indiana, more so because of the history of the two programs than their current state. I expect to see the Mizzou-Illinois rivalry pick up a ton in the near future, following the Braggin\\' Rights games being dead for the last few years. Football   Ohio State-Best trophy in sports, the Illibuck.   Purdue-Play for the Purdue Cannon.   Northwestern-Used to play for Sweet Sioux Tomahawk, but the NCAA banned it. Now play for the land of Lincoln trophy.   Missouri-Arch Rivalry. Haven\\'t played in while (2007?). Looks like they might renew the rivalry starting in 2025.    None of this are crazy rivalries. Northwestern is our biggest rival technically as we play them during \"rivalry week\"   Basketball   Indiana-Not as much now, but used to be big riavlry.

The top reply was: In Shen's defense, thermodynamics is the kind of subject you will either: 1) never need again, or 2) definitely take again in grad school. You're basically just getting an introduction so you'll be able to more effectively learn the specifics next time around. Can you expand? Poor professor? How are the exams? Shen is a cool dude but he REALLY doesn't seem to care about the class. He lets you learn everything on your own and uses class time to just answer questions as of last fall. Your entire grade is quizzes so just prepare for those and you'll be fine, they aren't too difficult Just prepare to learn everything on your own, avoid taking this class if it's not required. You could take Phys 427 or Chem 444 instead. <eos> \",\n",

You will have to show ID, but any testing will NOT be added to your medical record and no information will be released without your consent. If you are being tested for HIV and are in school, then your name will NOT be on the paperwork at all. I can assure you that the testing is confidential and will not show up anywhere. I hope this resolves some of the worry. You can find more information about what happens at the visit [here]([url link] It is more important for you to be tested, than to be worried about it.

The classroom is no place for advertising and I would like to stop them from plastering these up everywhere. Who do I contact about it? The top reply was: Separation of church and state implies that the state cannot give religous groups any elevated rights beyond what is given to other groups and inversely that they cannot treat religious groups worse than other groups. So there is no reason they shouldn\\'t be allowed to post on bulletin boards that exist for student groups to post on. I\\'ve seen some bulletin boards with \"Student Activities Flyers Only\" or \"No business advertising\" signs and the more passive-aggressive \"This bulletin board is NOT for your stupid bus advertisement\". I feel that some of them are put up by students and professors, others might be put up by departments. Suburban Express... shadiest business practices ever. Hate them. Have you tried contacting Nick Offerman? Googling around a little I found that Suburban Express donates money to College of Communications. Presumably they donate to other departments, too. A department which is receiving donations from them probably wouldn\\'t want to tear down their posters. Actually I was talking about professor Scott Ahlgren lol <eos> ',\n",

              " '<bos> It is a little confusing to me as to why the ARC and CRCE tracks made the inside lanes \"slow\" and the outside lanes \"fast.\" Doesn\\'t it make more sense to have it as the opposite? My thoughts are that if the lanes were reversed, there could be less collisions or frustration on the tracks. If you are trying to pass someone from the outside lane, it takes longer than if you were to use the inside lane. This ends up causing more traffic in many cases. That being said, does anyone know what lane was used to measure the length of the track? If it was the inside lane, I see it as another reason to reverse the lanes. In most cases (not all) walkers are not concerned with the distance they are traveling. The top reply was: General track etiquette is that you pass on the outside. I would assume this is the reason its laid out like it is. When its relatively empty, i still run in the \"walk\" lane, as long as im not in anyones way. I think they have it switched because you enter the track from the inside compared to the outside on a normal track. Slower runners and walkers would need to cut across more lanes and I think it could create more jams/collisions. Every indoor track (for fitness not competition) has the slower runners at the inner track since that\\'s the entrance. The difference between outdoor and indoor tracks are usually where the entrance to the track is. You don\\'t want slow runners or walkers entering in the same lane as the fastest runners. I\\'ve had bad times with that 90° corner. So glad CRECE doesn\\'t have that.  Now if they can only put the surface the ARC track has at CRECE. Good points. I would imagine that the track is measured relative to the inside lane, so that each lap is \"at least\" an eighth of a mile. The only reason I can come up with is that runners might prefer the wider turns in the outside lane, the hard 90° corner at the ARC notwithstanding... ... yeah, no idea. <eos> ',\n",

The amount of carbonation which makes things taste good varies considerably. Limeade is great with some, but a bit overpowering when heavily carbonated. The underdog was definitely chocolate milk. I did not expect to enjoy that as much as I did. I'll probably try some liquor tonight. Hey man, let me know if you need a second opinion on the liquor. Also, can I recommend blue curacao? Delicious. Sure, second opinions are always good. Feel free to bring some curacao by. :D <eos> \",\n",

They obviously know college students drink. They\\'re here to help, so there\\'s no point in making such an extreme lie.

I did have my iCard on me and I think they take responsibility for every student that goes to the hospital just to follow up and make sure that the student realizes what he/she did wrong and so that they cover their own ass in case it turns into a big fiasco Edit: Every student admitted to the hospital that goes for alcohol/drugs They just ask you therapy questions off a script and send you on your way <eos> ',\n",

I have done my research, but still have not found answers to these questions: 1. What topics are covered on each exam? 2. How much time do we get for each exam? Thank you for your help in advance. The top reply was: ALEKS math was extremely easy. It is Algebra 2/Trig tops, with a focus on rational (fraction) addition/subtracting and simplification; at least for me, as the test is individualized based on your performance on previous questions. Chem/Phsy, not sure because when I sign into the placement test place the only tests available for me are English tests (which I don\\'t have to take).  I got a 98% in 50 minutes (\"average\" time is 90min) coming from AP Calc AB this year. Placement doesn\\'t matter. It just decides what classes you need to take to be at pace with your peers. For example, if you do well they will place you in calc 2 instead of calc 1. You will still have to complete the same amount of math credits to graduate but you won\\'t have to take a class where you already know everything. If you are especially clever but did not take an AP test ( or something similar) you can take a proficiency test. Passing grades will give you credit in that class so you don\\'t have to take it.  That\\'s how I got my first year of chemistry out of the way. you can get out of 102/103. You can also proficiency out of the entire calc sequence and physics sequence. What physics and chem placement tests are you taking? It depends on that. And as others said, ALEKS is very easy - don\\'t sweat it. It\\'s all pretty basic shit, and honestly, unless you really fuck up. try and force yourself into Physics 211 and Chem 102, and whichever calculus you need to take. <eos> ',\n",

ALSO for anyone that's taken the class before, is there any curve at the end of the course? Tried looking Dyer's reviews on RateMyProfessor but none of them say anything about curving, even though it's such a large class and not everyone seems to be doing well enough for a good distribution.  Thanks in advance!  The top reply was: I am in the class this semester, but haven't been able to find study material. It seems the exams were all closely related to the practice exams so what I plan on doing is retaking the practice exams, and then looking over the 3 exams from this past semester and studying from those. Make sure to pay attention to the questions that appear on the exams that are almost word for word from the practice exams.

I know there's a men's warehouse somewhere around Champaign but it sounded like it was fairly far away.  The top reply was: I'd second Jos Khun in downtown Champaign. It is an old-school store unlike anyplace else, along the lines of getting a straight-razor shave at a barber. You get the royal treatment, just be respectful and courteous. There is Jos Khun  Co in downtown champaign which is pretty nice. You can also get some nice stuff online. If you want something very nice that will last you a long time, you can get some steals on barely used Allen Edmonds from people on eBay. I would avoid online stuff unless you can get it tailored in some way after the fact. A well fit suit will look perfect Also adding in about Jos Kuhn in DT champaign. Very personal help, and they can send it out for altering for you. Bonus: easily accessible by bus from campus. They a have pretty good clearance section as well. Their suits aren't actually crazy expensive. Try there first and then hop the bus to the mall if you strike out. Umm...they have tailors in CU. <eos> \",\n",

I figured it would be good to know in general as well. The top reply was: Ask a squirrel. If the question is more suited for your department, go to them. If I had an Econ question or needed to figure out what Econ classes I need to take I go to them. If the question is broader than that go to the college. This may be something department specific. I'd suggest always presuming a smaller granularity because: * There may be department specific interpretations or consequences to that information. * They'll hopefully know you more personally. * The demand on time for a department advisor might be lower than a college. Let the department advisor tell you if you need to escalate the question. Or just try both and go with the one that actually answers the phone? This only works if you speak squirrel or if you're a telepath. If its specific to your major I'd recommend the dept advisors. The college advisors are useless for help. They're only good for signing off on things. At least in my experience for engineering. <eos> \",\n",

I am just trying to become healthy, but I don't know anything about gym equipment or how to workout effectively. Any advice/input is appreciated. thanks! The top reply was: I actually started with the personal trainers a few weeks ago and would recommend it. Pros: working out in a private room away from the rest of the ARC, having someone push you regularly, motivation to go, learning new things without embarrassment. Cons: expensive, don't learn much about gym etiquette Wow this  A few of the best lifters at the arc are trainers, but some of the worst lifts I have seen were done by arc trainers. It 200% depends on who the trainer is. Any recommendations on good trainers? Sorry, not any more. I've been away from the ARC for over a year. If you're interested in learning lifting, the Powerlifting Club meets fairly regularly there and is totally happy to lift with anyone regardless of skill level. Go with Marco Sardela if he still works there. Guy actually competes as a powerlifter. <eos> \",\n",

I went once last semester and they did not ask for i-cards. I am curious to know how this went??? Did they ask to see your iCard? I have been to the Union to watch the movies often this semester and last semester. They don't check for an iCard. Side note, they have free popcorn if you're one of the earlier students there.

I know posts like these really annoy everyone, but I already checked the subreddit for a similar question and I wasn't able to find an answer. Thanks!  The top reply was: It's very easy to take tons of fruit from the dining hall. It's highly unlikely anyone will care. I walked out with a whole napkin dispenser last year... works nice in my apartment Last year I would bring Tupperware in my bookbag and fill them with food. I also used to put tons of fruit in my bookbag. It's not hard, just try and sit in a corner and make sure there's no workers around. I frequently walked out of the dining hall with a sandwich in my hand and nobody cared. Nope you are right Residents eating in the dining halls may take a choice of one piece of fruit or one cookie or one ice cream cone and a non-dairy beverage in a thermos mug (up to 22 oz.) from the dining hall. Everything else must be consumed before you leave the dining area. A $10 charge may be assessed for any item above the one item provision. Have they changed things? Back in 2009-2011, they allowed you to take either one piece of fruit, one cookie, or one 16 oz container of a non-dairy beverage. Even back then, I knew people who would sneak in some Tupperware and fill them with cookies or a sandwich for later.  OP, just do a quick looksie around for staff and stick it in your bag. You're paying oodles of money for your meal plan, might as well get some apples out of it. <eos> \",\n",

Thank you for any help. The top reply was: Fake it till you make it. Under the name of the University put Division of General Studies rather than a major or degree type.  We do not recommend putting the major you intend to transfer to bc it hasn’t happened yet and you don’t want to be called out for not being truthful. In your cover letter you can state that you’re planning to transfer into “X” major, but you really shouldn’t list it if you’re not there yet. Say \"planning to major in X.\" That\\'s accurate.  Most schools don\\'t have an analog of DGS, so \"DGS\" can be confusing and sound like you\\'re not in a proper program.  In liberal arts schools, it\\'s common not to declare a major until sophomore year, easy to change it later, and people may say \"planning\" even if they are well into a major.  So \"planning\" means you aren\\'t lying but they\\'ll probably read right past it. u/IllinoisTCC: Have you received any feedback from employers on what they want to see?

Does anyone know anything about this or could anyone share their experiences? The top reply was: Hi there!  I'm the girl who has been sending you these emails! I went to the conference my freshman year, and it was a great experience. I liked it so much, that I'm organizing it this year! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me through email or here on reddit :) Hope to see you in August! It was a good experience for me. I lived in Bromley and the conference was a couple days before move in so I got to skip the crowd and move in early. As for the conference goes, it is two days. It is ran by upperclassman in AIAA which is a national organization but UIUC has their own chapter. It is a good way to meet other students in Aerospace Engineering, and a good way to join a club right off the bat. You'll be doing homework with these students for the next four years so it will be a good to meet some of them now. I think at mine we did junkyard rockets where you just take a bunch of random items and create a rocket. I would recommend going if you can. It never ceases to amaze me how many Aeros are on this sub.  Anyway, definitely go. I went my freshman year and then helped organize it the following years. Besides having an excuse to move in early, you meet future friends and a couple professors.  You can PM me questions because I'm helping organize it again this year. Same here. Best parts were my first time having Papa Del's and moving in early. Now I know your username, mwahahah <eos> \",\n",

              " '<bos> If you were considering running an app to auto-register you into a course....  The authorities are vague about how anti-social the app has to be, in order to get you banned.   However, I just heard it from a very reliable source that the penalty is gruesome:  you have to make any further changes to your fall registration on paper, at the registrar\\'s office.  This is plausible, since they use a penalty of similar style on faculty who don\\'t submit their grades on time. Oh, yeah, and also CS is running checks for seat savers, so you might want to consider dropping before Steve catches you. The top reply was: I\\'m guessing, but I suspect what they really care about is jamming/overloading the registration system, so that it\\'s hard for other people to use.   E.g. very frequent requests. What does \"how anti-social the app has to be\" mean? The ridiculousness is *too many students for finite resources*; this is the reality. The *fairness of the current registration process* is independent and distinct from that reality. You cannot and will not fix the former by cheating on the latter. Given our reality, the process is as fair as it can be (well, to the best efforts of admin). Cheating your fellow students by buying/building software or seat-saving is a non-solution. That is, it makes the entire process less fair, worse.  You may as well let students bid extra tuition $ to get into classes, or use hot or not to distribute class spots based on physical attractiveness. They should solve the cause of the problem  Two choices.  The easy way - Get Admissions dept to come to their senses and send an appropriate (lower) number of students into overcrowded majors. Of course, many would find their exclusion from the program to be a sub-optimal solution to their registration headaches. The hard way - as suggested earlier, find $30+ million for a new building and 20 new faculty members in your back pocket you\\'d like to gift over, and wait 3+ years. Of course, if the same nitwits are running Admissions, this will be no solution at all as they will simply increase the number of students in the program to overwhelm any growth in resources. Glad I\\'m graduating before they caught on Out of curiosity, is this message directed at auto-signup bots, also \"checking\" bots (ones that merely check if a class has an open slot without signing you up)?

I know of Savoy, but I haven't heard of any others. Is Savoy my best bet? And if not, what would be? EDIT: Thanks a lot for all of your help, guys! Savoy is a pretty nice theater, and the fact that they have a student discount is awesome. In addition to that, I recommend that you all check out 50/50 when you have the chance, it's phenomenal.  The top reply was: There's just the two, [Savoy]([url link] and [Beverly]([url link] IMHO, Savoy is better.  * Tickets are cheaper at Savoy * Food is cheaper at Beverly, but popcorn refills at Savoy are 50 cents, so buy a bucket and bring it with you every time * Beverly is easier to get to (in terms of buses) * I think Savoy has better seats xD Basically, if you don't have a car, Beverly will be easier, but if you have the option, go to Savoy. There is also a movie theater in Champaign called Carmike Beverly. It's out on North Prospect by the Meijer. I don't prefer one over the other. I've never had a bad experience at either and I think they're about the same price! That another option if Savoy doesn't have a time that you don't like. the north yellow has a stop directly in front of the savoy theater Being to both, I'd have to say your best bet is Savoy in terms of atmosphere of the theater. In my opinion, Beverly is smaller and a bit more run down. Your less conventional option for tonight is going to see the Exorcist at Virginia Theater - Assuming the movie isn't concrete. ($5 at 1PM or 7PM) Virginia Theater is a LOT nicer than the other two in my opinion (and closer than the other two), but they don't show movies as often. Its a really nice older theater Heres a picture of the actual theater to see what I mean: [url link] Savoy is your best option by far. Also, 50/50 is great. I saw it there last weekend.

Not sure what you mean. It is not shutdown at all. Many landlords are prepping units for new arrivals during mid August but otherwise shops are open and such. It is true there are a lot of University people on vacation during early and mid August because that is when one can get away w/o affecting faculty/staff/students very much. If you can't move in early, stay with a friend. If you don't have Friend, try couch surfing or a hotel. If not, stay at home. I can't do early move-in. I checked. any other suggestions?

I want to go to UIUC, but looking at it, the cost will be around $50k. I didn't get any scholarships in my acceptance letter, and I probably won't qualify for need-based aid. My parents will pay for a good portion of it (~35k) but the rest is up to me. Should I stay in Georgia or come to UIUC? EDIT: Thanks for all the responses guys. I'll wait until scholarship offers come in around March/April to make a final decision, but I'm definitely considering coming here either way.  The top reply was: In ChemE graduating this semester. This is wrong, you don't need a masters. As of now, probably 60% I would say have accepted full time offers. And this is before the spring career fairs It sounds like your parents are in a good position to pay a lot of it. However, if I were in your position again, I would have chosen to go to a community college instead for my first two years. You could probably go to one for free or very low cost and then transfer here in 2 years. It could also help with the transition from high school level work to the level of work here, something I struggled with a bit my first year. This is completely inaccurate for ChemE. All entry level jobs only require a bachelors. I went to a state school in my home state during my undergrad and then went to UIUC for a masters.  My grad program was funded and I graduated early from my undergrad. So I was able to graduate with a masters in 5 years without much debt. The viability of this is program specific of course but if you're considering grad school at all, it's probably worth it to go some place cheap for an undergrad and do well there. Then you can enter grad school with no / minimal debt. This. Just go to Community college, get a 4.0 and then transfer in. You will have basically a 4.0 cumulative GPA, and your resume won't get dumpstered half the time when you apply for internships. <eos> \",\n",

A company must provide at least 3 weeks to consider an offer by ECS guidelines * Offer resulting from a summer internship -- October 1 or three weeks from the date of offer, whichever is later. * Offer from interviews conducted during the Fall semester -- December 1or three weeks from the date of offer, whichever is later. * Offer from interviews conducted during the Spring semester -- April 1 or three weeks from the date of offer, whichever is later. If a company does not adhere to these, report them to ecs so the company stops misbehaving in the future. Reported companies will typically be temporarily barred from participating in on campus events. Exploding offers are unethical. Dont let a company mistreat you. The top reply was: Just to clarify your second sentence - if an offer is extended after December 1 or April 1 then they must give at least 3 weeks. Otherwise they must not expire before December 1st. It\\'s not a global 3 week minimum :). As far as I\\'m aware nobody (students or companies) seems to be aware of these guidelines. In my experience so far only Google recruiters were aware of and adhered to them. Bottom line is if you feel pressured by time then break out the guidelines but otherwise keep it in your back pocket. Gotta love those exploding offers lol You should kindly inform the company of this policy before submitting a report. A company originally gave me a week to decide, and after I let them know, they gave me a 3 month extension. Others are being delusional lol. This guy has it right. If they could get the fuck rid of you and benefit from it they would, and professionalism would go out the window and they would call it \"good business practices\". yes <eos> ',\n",

Shoot your shot fam As in cumulative sum of all grades in the course is 0.x from the next benchmark? I’d say your best bet is to find like 5-10pts on an exam to get back, if they don’t have a statute of limitations for that.  For a final grade, maybe say to the ta/prof why the grade matters to you, and why you deserve the grade jump.  Also, almost never are syllabus cutoffs used for final grades. And almost never do TAs assign final grades, we don’t even have access to report them (faculty only). It might help if you could find something small that would make the difference.

I'm between Astrophysics and Energy/Sustainability but can't decide which one to do. The top reply was: Definitely not that difficult. However, ECE 205 can be really tough (I have not taken this class so I cant help you there.) And environmental econ is supposed to be pretty tough (but if econ comes easily to you, and you're a physics major, it is definitely doable.) Hope that helps at all? Definitely talk to others about this decision though. Counselors or professors or students in the program. The energy/sustainability to option is something I considered for a while. I ended up not doing that option because I felt it lacked substance. The classes didn't seem to have a cohesive theme. Taking ATMS 201 isn't going to make you great at atmospheric science. Enviro econ is important but a different irrelevant set of skills from ATMS 201. The NPRE 400 level classes are useful hands on skills, but you're only required to take one, and so you lack any advantage to NPRE students. I would talk to as many people as possible and most definitely Merissa Jones. There might be other options out there than you see. I stuck with LAS physics, and chose to minor in Geology. Now I'll be taking 15+ hours of Geology, including 10+ of 400 level Geology courses to hone my skill. This isn't meant to dissuade you of course! Getting an opinion from as much people as possible is always useful. :) I'd like to piggyback on this post and ask if the professional track option adequately prepares students for grad school or if there are other significant classes that I should take if my plan is to get a phd? For physics, the specialized curriculum is the grad school route. Although title doesn't matter as much as the classes you take Yeah that's pretty helpful, thanks!

Basically, the chem asks a bunch if questions about naming compounds, ions, molar/nuclear mass, and a lot of definition type things. Nothing an electrochem, no acid base, no titrations, no organic. Hell, if you really wanna just do well you can just look up the answer on google while you're doing it. Most of them are a one google type thing. How hard is the CS 125 proficiency test? How about Math 241? But where do I find those old tests? The department websites only show the course contents. Thanks! What chem are you trying to proficiency out of? I can hook you up with practice 102 midterms and final if you pm me your email <eos> \",\n",

Good/bad experiences? Massage therapists to recommend or stay away from? Thanks! The top reply was: i went to Bodywork associates twice back in 2006 or 2007 and both experiences were wonderful. Of course, I can't guarantee the same people are working there now but it seemed like a well run business back then I've gone there total of four times, twice at the ARC location and twice the other location, for back pain. Very good experiences. I think the massage therapist I had appointments with at the Champaign location was Laura something if my memory serves correctly (it's been about a year). Either way, I was very satisfied with their services. They were very professional and my back pain subsided substantially even after only a couple of sessions. I've gone there a couple times last school year (2011-2012) but it seems like the massage therapist I used always request doesn't work for them any more. It was overall a good experience, If anything just try out a 30 minute massage for your first time if you're nervous about going to Bodyworks. I've great reviews about Doug, however it is very difficult to get an appointment with him... He is the owner, and all! I'm hoping to get a gift certificate from here for Christmas! <eos> \",\n",

I'll be stuck in Champaign for a month with nothing to do and nobody to talk to nor with whom to hang out. I'm from New York, but I grew up in Champaign. I've no idea what there is to do here, nor how to fill my time. Could anyone possibly help out, give me either some suggestions with what to do or someone with whom I could hang out, kill some time?

              " \"<bos> So i'm living in an apartment this year, over in Urbana in 700 S. Gregory. Pavlov media was advertising, along with JSM, that they had highspeed wireless throughout entire building. I had never heard anything about them that was bad/good so I figured if it was as easy as signing up online and having internet ASAP that I would do it. BIG MISTAKE. Horrible speed. Lucky enough my bedroom can connect to UIUCnet, but I don't like not being able to take my laptop away from the hotspot.  For all you computer/network people out there, will hooking up a router through the ethernet port make it any faster? Or is it the internet service period that is horrible. I'm thinking the wireless is just shit, but I don't want to go spend money on a router to get the same speed? The top reply was: Here's the deal with the big three:  Pavlov: okay internet (can get really slow), terrible network security  Comcast: terrible company, better internet than Pavlov  ATT(specifically U-Verse): *really fucking slow* to setup. I'm still waiting for it (ordered over a week ago, turnon date is the 30th).  The only thing Pavlov can do correctly is OC3s. Never had an outage. It's your provider. You done goofed. See, everyone posts awful things about Comcast, but I never had any problems with them while I was in Champaign. My service was always good, and my internet was always cooperative. Maybe it's because I don't use the internet for much outside of surfing Reddit, but I never had problems with Comcast for the 5 or so years I used them (both in Champaign and at home). I live at One South. We have Pavlov media. My download speed is constantly at around 12KB/s. Im plugged into the wall. Its like this on any PC I use, including one with a brand new, vanilla windows 7 install.  Pavlov is simply below a human standard. My phone has faster internet. I guess you've been fortunate. The majority of experiences I've heard were not good. For me, when it works, it works well. But I hate that it isn't always reliable. <eos> \",\n",

Very simple design required, just a 2-color logo. I know there are a couple options on campus but wonder if there are cheaper options online since many places use the same offsite OEM/manufacturer. Thanks for your help in advance! The top reply was: Weiskamp screen printing is a great local option Campus Sportswear is also really good with tight/crazy deadlines, as well as any rules that other places might have with logos or using U of I's name. Highly recommend weiskamp. Not too familiar on their price structure but they have great products Campus Sportswear on Sixth Street by Clys is a good local one. The RSO I was a part of on campus did most of our shirt printing there. Awards Limited is also good. I used to deal with a screen printing place on 6th Street above the Korean restaurant in 2011-2012.  [url link] Turn around time for 60 reversible screen printed basketball jerseys was about 2 weeks if I remember correctly.  All the screen printing is done in house, the people were friendly, and prices were good. I'd highly recommend supporting them. <eos> \",\n",

              " \"<bos> For last semester I had a 4.0 but 3 out of 6 classes that I was enrolled in were online/easy classes. I’m wondering when I apply for jobs if recruiters will take a very close look at my transcript and find out that in order to boost my GPA I was enrolled in many online classes? Is this a bad thing? I’m really stressed :( Thanks! The top reply was: Nope they won't look at your transcript closely and honestly there's nothing wrong with boosting your GPA. It's a common thing in the pre-med community. I know I have at least 12 hours of 4.0 just from doing research. The transcript is mostly to prove what your major is, your GPA, and that you (for full time) have graduated. Depends on the person. Who knows. Bullshit classes are bullshit classes, regardless of whether you take them online. So I wouldn't worry about it. On the other hand, some hard classes are also offered online. While I'm sure there are some companies that do look at a transcript, I would venture to say that many (most?) do not. The effort and time involved with looking at a transcript is not usually worth the information on it, especially if someone outside of HR is doing the hiring. If you're looking to do more education, then your transcript is more important, but when I was hired for a position in my field I never even proved to them that I graduated. Is this for full time jobs after graduation? If so, you already missed fall recruiting for big 4. That aside, as long as you meet their GPA cutoff (3.4 or 3.5?) and have completed or are on track to complete your required courses and the 150 hour requirement, I don't think they care. I've never even been asked for a transcript which is good since my gpa is like .05 <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Anyone have any experience with the format/content of the Mathematics 231 (Calc II) proficiency exam for class credit? Easy? Difficult? Tips?  The top reply was: So if I asked you to integrate: (sqrt(u))/(sqrt(u)-1)) du, would you feel comfortable doing that? What about giving an epsilon-delta proof that the limit as x goes to 2 of x^2 is 4? Trig integrals? Could you tell me how to find the limiting value of a sequence? What about knowing which test to apply to evaluate the limit (if it exists) of an infinite series? All of these are key topics for Calc II at the University. You can probably get a syllabus online somewhere to study off of if you feel shaky. Honestly, I'd go for the proficiency and hope for the best, because Calc 231 here is hard as hell. Make good use of Paul's Online Math Notes and other such resources. Depends on your background. Did you take BC? What topics did you cover? How comfortable are you with nested (multiple techniques/iterations of the techniques) integration? What bout series and sequences? E-D proofs? I took Calc BC, however I received a 3 on the exam despite predicting much higher. I feel I understand the material more than my score demonstrated <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: You get icard access to the interaction room when you pass phys325 The way you said makes it seem like some kind of video game where you unlock levels, sounds so cool lol. it's exactly like a videogame where you need to find the keycard to unlock the door and proceed to the next level, except the keycard is at the end of a hallway of Lagrangians Is that the interaction room? EDIT: To answer my own question, yes, it is the interaction room. It's not open to the public because some dumbfuck undergrads and/or grad students left it messy and left bottles of alcohol in there. As a result, the head of the department banned everyone from there unless they had permission or unless there's an event going on there. The first-years still have access since they don't have TA offices yet. Poor babies.  Although this situation means I have to wash the office coffee pot in the bathroom sink instead of the Interaction Room sink, which is just actually the worst. <eos> \",\n",

I'm very fortunate I didn't get seriously hurt. I'd say it's less convenient. With a board, you don't have to go to a specific side of a building for a bike rack, you don't have to spend time locking it up, etc. Just pick it up and go inside. But it's more convenient, more agile and you don't have to take it inside with you. And cheaper.. <eos> \",\n",

I've seen online that it costs up to 1,000 dollars and I don't have that type of money... The top reply was: One option prior to a sleep study is to get a sleep recording app for your laptop and record yourself sleeping. There are some made for this purpose. If in face it is warranted they will not do the study there. If you want the study done locally you will be referred to one of the two clinics associated with the two hospitals in town. You will need to see if your insurance covers such a test. But your doc at McKinley can check many things first. Have you seen you primary care physician to discuss your concern yet? Maybe they'd be able to recommend preliminary treatment and tell you about sleep study opportunities. Good luck! <eos> \",\n",

              " \"<bos> I'm in a lecture with a professor who consistently continues to lecture 5-7 minutes after the scheduled end time of class, even starting new topics or examples at the time we are supposed to end. Should I interpret this as rude and disrespectful as I do? A lot of people need to make it to classes or work right after his class and they shouldn't have to miss material because he can't plan properly. Basically what I'm wondering is: should I communicate this to him or should I just relax? The top reply was: Just talk to him or send an e-mail. Definitely communicate your frustration with the professor. I'd recommend you be diplomatic about it, but classes certainly need to end at their specified times.  I've done this before with a professor and they were very understanding -- struggled to book it to a part-time job after class, but never ran into any more issues after mentioning this to the professor. I have no problem packing up and leaving early. My concern is that I'm going to miss something important. No need to be condescending. Not sure why you're the only one in this thread who needed to take that stance. How does s/he not notice all the sounds of the backpack zippers? I agree with everyone else that you should respectfully tell the professor that you need to leave at the scheduled time, I doubt they'd mind. However, I also understand your concern about starting new topics or examples during overtime, which I don't think is appropriate, even from a pedagogical point of view (students just won't process it).  I'm trying to see this from the professor's perspective. It's a bit unusual to go overtime consistently, because professors usually have meetings to go to or other work to get done, and would rather leave a class as soon as the contents for the day are done. However, professors also (usually) want to make sure all the important topics are covered, especially if future classes depend on them. It's possible that this is happening because they are moving very slowly through the syllabus in the beginning of the semester, with the expectation of speeding up later once everybody is on the same page. Or, they might just be bad at pacing a lecturing properly (teaching is hard), which can be especially but not exclusively true for junior faculty. Either way, I think respectfully informing them about the problem should be constructive to let them know that they need to improve. Believe it or not, professors are not perfect educators. <eos> \",\n",

How would I get it and how much (compared to when living on campus)? Also, how much money do people usually spend on food? Is living off-campus really worth it? The top reply was: Off campus living and food expenses are up to you but it can definitely be done cheaper than on campus. I would guess if you're trying to save money you could comfortably live off campus in a not great apartment with roommates + food for $600~ month. You just don't get the dorm cost or meal plans charged to your account, so you get a large refund check to be used on living expenses. It's a lot cheaper to live off campus. Just food alone will be vastly cheaper if you cook your own meals. You can live pretty well on a $400 a month food budget, and you can easily find a mediocre apartment with roommates for $400 a month (including utilities) if you look. That's $6400 for 8 months vs the 11k dorms cost and you're allowed to live there over the holidays.  Of course you'll probably be left holding the lease over the summer, so more realistically the cost is around $8000 but that's with a pretty healthy food/fun budget. A lot cheaper, but be mindful of where you choose to live if you are not from around here.  Check bus routes if you don't have a car, check on parking costs if you do, etc etc  And just make sure it's not in the ghetto.

Any winter course should basically be treated like a full-time course load. You’re doing 16 weeks in 4 and it’s not simplified or dumbed down so expect to dedicate all day every day to it. That said, if you don’t have a lot going on over break and you have the kind of self motivation it takes to finish, this is an excellently way to get a course you need out of the way. Have you taken econ 203 during Winter? I haven’t personally, no. I have interacted with the winter ECON courses as part of my job though and I’m familiar in that manner. <eos> ',\n",

Is there anyway I can turn it back? Thank you The top reply was: you can pretty much renew as long as you want unless someone else has a request for it to be put on hold They are pretty lenient over the break. Just call up the library or use the Ask a Librarian function while they are open. They should be able to help you out. If you're out of town and you really can't renew it, you could try going to library.illinois.edu and asking a librarian there (they have a chat-thingy on the page) if you have any options. You might be allowed to like return it to some nearby library and have them use interlibrary loan type things to get it back to Champaign...maybe. I'm pretty sure you can renew it several times.

I'm hesitant about buying a nice laptop as I am unsure if theft is prevalent. Is this something to worry about? Or will simply being cautious / smart be enough? The top reply was: If you are smart about it, you will have absolutely no issues. It's insane how many people leave their stuff out in the library when going to the use the restroom. Hell, I've seen laptops sitting out for a couple hours so people don't lose their spot. These are the type of people who have to deal with theft, but it is completely avoidable Laptop theft is non-existent here.  A certain number of students just happen to be extremely generous and enjoy leaving free laptops laying around. Laptops do get stolen a lot but it is because stupid people leave them sitting out while they go to bathroom, take a 3 hour lunch break, etc. Keep it with you at all times and you will be fine. It is prevalent, but only because so is stupidity. If you're reasonably careful, it shouldn't be a problem.

I'm going to attend Parkland and then reapply for readmission.  Those that were in my situation, can you tell me how it went for you? How did you do at the CC, what kind of grades you got, how difficult was Parkland than UIUC, and how many times you applied for readmission, and if you ended up being back at UIUC. Thanks guys.  The top reply was: Yes but a few people do get readmission after only 1 semester. Hopefully I can be one of those. Hey man! I am in the process right now of reapplying for admission. I was hoping you could give me some insight and tips for the narrative response for the application. I wanted readmission after one semester, but it wasn't a realistic goal. When re-entering, they really emphasize proof of improvement and responsibility. I figured one academic year away and successful would be ideal. Is it important to work part time while taking classes during your time away from Illinois? I've heard it is but I don't really see how working part time is that important.

I got only 1 interview from the career fairs, but 3-4 interviews from applying online/through ilink. I don\\'t really enjoy the career fairs because it usually goes pretty much like this: get on a packed bus to go to ARC like sardines in a can, wait in line for hours and then once I get to the recruiter, I give them my resume, elevator pitch, ask a few questions, but then they just tell me to apply on their career site. Such a waste of time and energy. Is this part of the advertising campaign? False. only if you ever hunt for the big leagues w/o serious ammo.

I know both take similar classes etc., but what careers would you be able to pursue within each major? Are there things that you cant do with a ACES FIN degree that you cant do with a CoB degree, I have heard that people in the CoB FIN are preferred over ACES FIN majors?. Also how is ACES financial planning program? I would love to hear from both sides of the spectrum.  The top reply was: I have heard great things about the ACES finance program personally. While both take similar classes, the Finance education here at Illinois is all about giving you a wide-understanding of financial instruments and the various interactions between financial entities. To dive into one specifically, it is recommended that you join one of the academies. (IBA,FA,Pricing Academy, and prime, which is for underclassmen)  That said, I won’t say you have anything more than the reputation of GIES when comparing cob with aces The ACES financial planning program has quite a bit going on. We've recently added a few new classes and pride ourselves in experiential learning. Outcome can guide you. If you want to work in a client/facing or back office financial planning role - ACES has you covered. If you are looking for a corporate finance position, risk management, auditing/accounting - the CoB have fantastic programs. Shoot me a message if you'd like to talk more about financial planning. Here's a thing. If you write Financial Planning, or Finance in Agribusiness (Which is my major), on the resume, company doesn't even know you are from ACES or CoB. In fact, my current internship employer thought I was from College of Business, and one of the boss actually liked my major because it has a focus in consumer sector. So, it's really how you word it and support with different experiences. I did shit tons of extra-curricular activities, like Prime, IPO, PwC Case comp, and my result has been pretty good. Company cares about what you can bring to them, not what you majored in. When you have no experience, then sure, they have to look at your major, so that they can make an assumption what you can bring to the company.

My first midterm didn't go that well and I think I missed at least a few points on the second midterm which I took last night, and I want to know around how much I have to get on the third midterm and the final to end up with an A in the class. I have Dunfield as my lecturer if that helps. Also, if anyone has been in my experience with this class stories are appreciated. Thanks. The top reply was: The class is curved a decent amount. You should be more focused on how you're doing relative to the average. The midterm 2 grades are up btw. It varies on the curve, which varies based on how people do in the class overall. From what I understand there's typically a curve around 5 percent, give or take a few more. I see. I checked the grade distribution last night and apparently 32% of people have an A and 34% have a B currently. This grade distribution seems absurdly high in comparison to ~23% A and ~34% B distributions in some past sections of Calc 3. -_- Can you please explain what you mean by a 5% curve? <eos> \",\n",

Unfortunately, over the years here at U of I, I never made any deep connections or academically stood out to professors here. I was, and am, pretty introverted. I feel like I\\'m pretty screwed because I don\\'t know who I can approach and ask to write me a shining academic performance letter.  Has anyone faced this problem before and is able to offer me advice?  The top reply was: I faced this problem. My solution probably isn\\'t the one you\\'re looking for because it was simply choosing not to apply to grad school. I had the same problem, I ended up asking three people and getting two. I would say just ask any professor in a class where you\\'re getting an A, the worst they can do is say \"no\" and one yes will go a long way. Also if you\\'ve worked at all in college or had an internship that will help. Personal statement and CV should be prepared for any professor that you ask. It\\'ll show that you\\'re responsible and very aware of their busy schedules. I was you! I asked two professors, one from senior year and one from junior year. I got As in both of their classes. I wrote my request letter in a way that prompted their memory of why I was great in their class so they would have something non-generic to write. I offered to meet with them to remind them who I was (none of them took me up on this) and said several (sincere) things I enjoyed about their class. I submitted a resume and other relevant application materials to them so they could mine them for useful things to say about me. If they say no, just move on and pick someone else. Professors get these requests all the time, in general they have a form letter they can modify if you help them out. It\\'s less of a big deal than you think it is, but I remember thinking it was monumental at the time. If one says no, don\\'t let that prevent you from asking another prof. Good luck! I\\'m in the same situation right now. Do you think if I get one letter from a phd student (also a TA), one from my manager during the summer internship and one from a professor would be adequate for the grad school program here? <eos> ',\n",

Even though I'm a CS major, I'm very interested in music, specifically in digital music composition, and would really like to take some of these courses. The top reply was: If they are Unit One courses, the trouble you might run into is that some of the courses are funded by the LLC fees from residents there. But, if a course is not going to fill up, the instructor or program director might let you in.

I got accepted into the college of business and I've been told that tuition is 5k more than what I previously had. 21k instead of the 16. However, nothing about my financial aid has changed at all. I'm also afraid I might have to take out more loans because of the additional 5k unless I get more scholarships/finaid.  I don't know if I should email FinAid about this but I thought I'd get a quicker answer on here. The top reply was: Yes, your tuition will rise, but not by that much. [[url link] For some reason the CoB tuition rates page isn't working for 2018 but I don't think tuition rose (assuming you're in-state). That's a big jump. Compare your award letters side by side to get the exact numbers. Even if your tuition goes up I don't think that will have any effect on financial aid received. If you have to take out more loans you'll just have to. So because I’m getting into it 2018 my rate will match that year? Although I came into the university in 2017? <eos> \",\n",

I don't mind people selling shirts etc but that seems to be the only thing that goes on around unofficial. I wish people tried planning bigger and better events. And I wish that UofI and champaign could lighten up a little. I don't understand why they can't let it become something like IU's little 5. I just think it could be so much more fun and special. Anyone have these feelings or has an opinion? The top reply was: It was never about making people have a great day. It was about bars making money. There's nothing special about puking on street corners. You and your friends can also get as drunk as you want on any other day, it doesn't have to be on Unofficial.  getting together with other people and having a day of drunken celebration so drinking with friends? lol Unofficial was started and is currently trademarked by the guy who owns like half the bars in town (Scott Cochrane). Any tradition or value you derive from that shitshow is entirely your own construct. Edit: In the years since I last researched this it seems that the trademark has been sold to UpMerch LLC, a clothing company. Because if people try to make it about something other than getting drunk people recoil in horror and say someone is trying to control the event and sanitize it. UIUC and Champaign/Urbana basically try to limit the number of deaths/accidents/etc because the event can be dangerous for the inexperienced. <eos> \",\n",

Reddit is harsh on those mistakes I guess, lol Common Ground is at the Lincoln Square mall in downtown Urbana. If you don't want to bother driving, any number of buses will get you from campus to Lincoln Square (the bus stop is right outside the mall) in about 5-15 minutes depending on where on campus you start from. Hell, you could walk to Lincoln Square from the Union by just walking all the way down Green Street. I'm looking more for fresh passion fruit than a tea.

The top reply was: First off, congrats on your acceptance!  To answer your question, that depends on what buildings you want to get into - the campus itself is still operational, that is, faculty and staff are still working and around as are most graduate assistants (who typically have to choose which breaks they get off, and most don't take spring break off). As far as dorms and dining halls, etc. go, I'd imagine those aren't open/have limited hours but I can't see why you'd want to go in there! I got mildly depressed the first time I visited campus because I didn't realize it was Spring Break. It'll feel a little lifeless without all the people, but you can still get a good look at the campus. There will still be plenty of people around. Buildings will still be open because many faculty and staff are still working. it's basically a southern, mid-size town feel on campus, but with modernized buildings during breaks. e.g., mostly older townies and dead after dark Check out the stores and restaurants on Green Street. It's nice to know you have the option of having cool places to go on the weekends. Also, check out the arc and some of the athletic fields nearby. <eos> \",\n",

I'm just trying to set up my dorm, and usually other dorms I have been in required a security page for log-in that caused issues. Owning a video game doesn't insinuate that it's the only thing I do... Although I still welcome your advice. There isn't that I know of. Just use a wired connection and you should be good They don't have any login for the Ethernet, and that's because they have the ports mapped to room numbers. They also throttle by MAC address. If you're technologically inclined, be careful about changing MACs. If they notice a different MAC address every time you reach your throttle limit, they'll shut off your internet completely for a while. <eos> \",\n",

I know I could take the greyhound but that wouldnt get me there until 5:15 pm and I was hoping to get there earlier. Does anyone know of any other ways? I assume since its a weekday I wouldnt be able to catch a ride with anyone :/ The top reply was: Yeah, but you have to go to Bloomington/Normal first, then take the train from there.

One of the important things (for me at least) is the building fees reaffirmation, specifically the Krannert Center. We need people to keep the krannert student fee. It allows U of I students $10 tickets for any show that plays at the Krannert center. It also funds all the productions that the Theatre and the other departments in the building put on. You can read more here: [url link] Carey Ash, grad student candidate to Student Trustee, was removed from the list of candidates a couple days ago, under the excuse of some bogus residency requirement. He has been endorsed by the Daili Illini, the GEO, and many RSOs. While he wages a legal battle to reverse his exclusion, his campaign calls students to vote for him as a \"write-in\" candidate to still win the election. So, do your part and let the administration know that you support an independent student trustee who is actually willing to stand up against them. TL; DR: write in Carey Ash for Student Trustee I\\'d have to say one really important thing on this list would be the Collegiate Readership Program. While it\\'s true that you can find most news online nowadays, there\\'s something to be said for giving students access to the physical paper itself.

Blink twice if Rob Pike is holding you captive I would love to teach a course in Go! It's a fantastic language. We give the CS 125 Proficiency Exam in C++ because that's what CS 225 uses. I'm not sure if I consider Go a successor to C++. It has a fair number of new idioms that C++ doesn't really come close to. Interestingly, I think I read somewhere that Google was surprised to find that Go appealed strongly to Python programmers. Maybe because last time I checked Python did concurrency poorly and Go does it exceptionally well. Actually that would be Russ Cox. I knew him a bit in graduate school. He's legit.  seems like Go is the most logical successor of C++ have you read golang-dev? even they don't know what's going on with the language. uh.. no <eos> \",\n",

Would I need to move it around everyday? The top reply was: There's a nice [parking thread]([url link] in the sidebar. in reference to point #2, it is 72 hours in urbana 1) Depends on where in Urbana you want to leave it. Obey the signage on the street you choose. 2) To be safe, you'll want to move it at least once every 48 hours. I'm not positive about Urbana, but in Champaign they'll ticket for that. the permit law only applies south of green street, so just go anywhere north of green / south of university Depends on where you park it. Some roads east of Lincoln, particularly the state roads, you need a permit to park between 3AM - 3PM, so you can't park it continuously overnight. To be honest, you might have better luck in Champaign on the streets south of Springfield, west of Neil. <eos> \",\n",

Definitely see the dual degree advisor in Lincoln Hall as the other comment mentioned. You should go into the LAS office in Lincoln hall. It's possible to get a dual degree degree but it tags on an additional 30 credit hours on top of your required hours for graduation (usually 120).

Because it's somewhat incorrect/misleading to use giga/mega/kilo when discussing data since they jump by factors of 1024 (gigabyte is 1024 megabytes etc).  Meanwhile, hardware manufacturers use the metric definition of the prefixes which jump by 1000, so a 32GB harddrive will be 32 billion bytes which translates to roughly 29.8 data Gigabytes.

Walmart does not have good produce but name brand items are really much cheaper than County Market. Meijer is surely cheaper than County. I then went with my Asian friends to the local Chinese and Indian (ethnic) stores - A large variety of the stuff there is not available in supermarkets, but much of it is -- surely the ethnic stores shouldn't be charging 40% premium on the same Coffee !! So, UIUC redditors, Which shops/mom-pop stores/ ethnic stores/ restaurants are out to fleece you in Chambana? The top reply was: The County Market on campus is more expensive than the other County Markets and grocery stores in general because it is the only grocery store on campus. For people living in apartments and no car it is virtually the only big store to shop at without having to deal with the bus system and carrying groceries long distances from a bus stop. I try to only shop at County when I need a few items, but it's just simple supply and demand. You can't blame them really, while it's shitty to shop there that's basic economics. I suspect that OP is not an economics major County Markup! Driving to Meijer, Walmart costs time and money. You pay a premium at County Market for having a grocery store in walking distance. Their fresh produce isn't more expensive than others.  Same applies to ethnic grocers. They sell some stuff at a premium because you get the convenience of having them in the same place with other obscure foods. If you feel it is not worth it, vote with your wallet. Nobody is forcing you to buy from them. The small ethnic stores might buy a case of coffee at a time where Wal-Mart gets 10,000 cases, while it might not help your wallet to shop local it certainly helps the local economy. Wal-Mart and Meier will always be must less expensive, the size of their inventories keeps costs down. I don't think any business in particular is trying to fleece anyone, if that was true they'd be out of business. <eos> \",\n",

If you\\'ve taken the proficiency exam for the class, was there a lot of trick questions or was it straight-forward for the most part? Was there a lot of calculations involved? Can you recommend any advice in terms of which concepts were most emphasized on the exam? Thanks in advance! The top reply was: Yes, I could do that. However, the opportunity cost of taking Vasquez\\'s class is that I could\\'ve filled my schedule with another class, such as a gen-ed requirement. I\\'d also save some money taking the proficiency exam instead of having to buy FlipIt Econ and other supplementary materials for his class. Try to test out of it, I took it with Vasquez and while I got an A (maybe an A+, don\\'t remember), I couldn\\'t understand what the fuck he was saying during lecture, maybe it was my hearing or lack of interest from how boring it is. He does make the subject interesting with wildass scenarios, but I was still bored to death. And I\\'m an Econ major. honestly just take it with Vasquez. Everything is online, just show up to class for attendance. Entire course took me 2-3 hours of work at end of the semester. Yeah, I\\'m already pretty familiar with all the concepts because I took AP Microeconomics and I\\'d hate to have to go to lecture for attendance and be bored the entire time when I could be using that time to doing something more useful. Take the proficiency test and use the freed hours for your gen eds or get ahead on a minor or another major. I took the test and it was very straightforward. It ultimately reduced to \"do you know your definitions\" and \"do you know how these curves should be shaped.\" <eos> ',\n",

I like the idea of having the same prof for 2 classes, specially if he's a good lecturer. The top reply was: Alvarez is pretty clutch. He subbed in for a few of my 313 lectures (I had Yi Lu in Fall 2013). Don't do Schutt-Aine unless it's 342/350. He can get pretty boring at times. The choices for 210 are Alvarez, Wei He, Schutt-Aine and a TBA so Eden isn't available (as of yet). I don't really know the other profs and can't find too much info on them. Hajek is best for 313. he's actually my favorite ECE professor here, super nice guy who's genuine and helpful. pretty sure I went to/had guest lectures with Alvarez and he wasn't that good. I'm having him for 313 now. He's okay but I don't know how good he actually is since I usually can't focus during lectures. 313 has great course notes by Hajek though. As for 210, I had Eden and he was pretty awesome. <eos> \",\n",

I\\'ll be getting to UIUC in Jan 10th, and staying at a hotel until the 15th, however I\\'m not sure if It would be better for me to ship to my hotel or to the dorm I\\'ll be staying at (Hopkins Hall).  Would I be able to pickup my Mac before check in, or only on the 15th? Or should I just ship it to my hotel? Thank you! The top reply was: i don\\'t think any remotely reputable hotel will steal a package. and FedEx/UPS do NOT require the signature of the \"buyer\", they need a signature of anyone who receives the package. Hotels will usually take packages for you. I would let them know in advance and get confirmation. Maybe don\\'t say what it actually is though. If you are shipping via Amazon, there is a drop off location at the union. Delivering to a ups access point, illini bookstore amazon location, or fed ex location would be safe. Generally speaking I think the employees would rather keep their jobs than risk being caught- after all, you\\'ll have tracking info.  If delivery gets refused, you can pick up the package at the shipping facility. You\\'ll need a car though. If you are staying in Hopkins, UPS or Fedex packages shipped to your address will be delivered to the package center in the Student Dining and Residential Programs (SDRP) building. I believe it won\\'t open for pickups until [Monday Jan 16th]([url link] but your delivery should be ready for you there. You can sign up for package notifications in [MyHousing]([url link] If you want to have it before then, it can be shipped someplace else as suggested by others. <eos> ',\n",

The top reply was: Alright pretty sure the 5 is a load of bullshit the college on engineer advisors(these aren’t your specific college advisor) tell you because 231 is a weed out class. When you sign up for classes, sign up for 241.  Do not retake calc 2. waste of time and effort. It's recommended that you take Calc 2 with a 4 on the BC test. However, you can take calc 3 since a 4 gives you credit for calc 1 and calc 2. I'd suggest going straight to calc 3 unless you plan on taking it at a local community college. I think the other thing people don't mention is that Calc 3 is not as related to Calc 2 as Calc 2 is related to Calc 1. Often times people do much better in Calc 3 than Calc 2 with Calc 2 being the most difficult course in the sequence. When I met with my advisor she seemed very rude so I don't really feel like contacting her if it's not necessary. I got a 4 too and I'm registered for 241. Like it's recommended to talk to your advisor but it's totally up to you. Nothing prevents you from registering for 241 AFAIK <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: The Campus Bike Code prohibits locking your bicycle to anything other than a bicycle parking rack. If the bike parking location at your destination is full, do not park on a rail, post, or tree. Instead, use another nearby bike parking area. A bicycle parked anywhere that is not a designated bike parking area may be impounded, and parked bicycles creating a safety hazard or impeding traffic flow will be removed. If you think your bike may have been impounded, contact the Parking Department at 217-333-3530 or ParkingComments@illinois.edu to retrieve it. Why is this downvoted? This person\\'s suggesting that your bike might have been impounded and not stolen. What type of lock did you have on the bike? I used to use U lock bikes with the password dials, not the keys. Easier to transport, and you don\\'t need to bother bringing a key everywhere. Also, I used to get cheap bikes from the bike project so that nobody would steal from me. Meta level tactics here.

Isn\\'t ECE417 multimedia signal processing or something, and mostly speech stuff? \"research\\'s\"... Apparently they haven\\'t done enough research on the English language. M.Eng. and MCS are programs that are designed to generate revenue for the university by the students paying tuition. MS / PhD in ECE/CS are ones where the money generated comes from grants/teaching assistantships.  Programs which are designed to generate revenue by tuition don\\'t allow students to take things that give tuition waivers. Also, the standards for M.Eng. ECE and MS ECE are significantly different; I suspect the same for MCS. A lot of the topics used in signal processing/information theory go hand in hand with topics hot in machine learning today. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks are based on a signal processing topic known as Convolution which is often used in compressing audio.  Tl;dr Signal Processing/Information Theory and Machine Learning are essentially two sides of the same coin <eos> ',\n",

There were 3 or 4 different lectures but you could sign up for any discussion sections you want, and you take the same midterms and final.

              " \"<bos> If you're planning to take both Chem 332, and MCB 354 at some point, it would be very wise to take MCB 354 first. Biochem is much easier than Orgo 2, and Orgo 2 will not prepare you for Biochem as much as Biochem will prepare you for exams 3, and 4 of Orgo 2. This saves you half of the studying time you'll need for the Orgo 2, 332, exams, which require dozens of more studying hours than an MCB 354 exam, since theres literally twice the material on Orgo 2 exams.  TL;DR Chem 332, with Dr. Koerner makes MCB 354 seem like a joke when comparing the amount of material required and therefore it would be wise to take Chem 332 after MCB 354.  The top reply was: Koerner was a good teacher but damn that class was tough. I agree, having knowledge of Amino Acids and Sugars really helps with the 2nd half of Chem 332 The difficulty of organic chemistry in MCB 354 varies greatly with the professor that teaches the second half of the semester, where metabolic pathways are covered. Professors like Morrissey rarely test any mechanisms, while others like Gerlt will literally make a third of the test arrow pushing diagrams. Both those classes are easy <eos> \",\n",

If you sign up, you should opt out of Courtesy Pay. Chase: They're everywhere. ATMs on campus are a bit sparse compared to UIECU and TCF, but look up where they are. It's not too bad. TCF: You get a free hoodie. You can hook up your i-Card to your checking account. Ally or Charles Schwab: refund all ATM fees. Ally is completely online I think? I like Busey a lot! It's small and they're not very exciting, but I've never had banking staff work so hard to help me solve my problems. I don't agree with this because I don't think someone should have that large a sum in their checking account. If that interest is so important, you should have money in a savings account with high interest. I think Ally and Barclays and Capital One have the highest interest rates right now. Ally is awesome if you're willing to deal with the whole online-only thing. If you want physical branches, try to pick a major national bank that has branches near your home and close to campus (PNC, Chase are the big ones) Ally is completely online, it's what I use. Pretty great. Aside from having to find a different way to get cash into my account. <eos> \",\n",

There is nothing you can do on your end. They use cat3. So of course WiFi in 2017 is going to be faster. However, you get decent ping though using ethernet especially if you want to game. Yes, that is normal. The physical wiring in many of the older halls was installed in 1986 when Illinois Bell handed the wiring plant over to the University. The ethernet jacks are run using the Cat 3 standard. That limits the port to 10Mb/s full duplex. The Wifi is faster. Use the wifi if you can. *edit: Forgot to change the copy pasta reply. i tried playing a round of overwatch with busey evans' ethernet and it was absolutely unplayable. wifi for everything Yes it's slow. Painfully slow. But if you need the stable connection for gaming it's your only option. <eos> \",\n",

Does anyone know all the summer registration dates there is? I can't find all the possible dates of registration there is. I'm nervous that all the classes that will be left will be morning classes(not a morning person). Thanks! The top reply was: Hopefully I'll have the motivation to go in mornings like I do now. I think I will. Thanks for the advice. I'm sure your sophomore, junior, and senior years will be better! Yes i can tell you anything before 11 or 12 makes you want to go to class looking like a zombie because its too early to care, let alone force yourself to go. That's the advice I can give you, once second semester is there you lose all drive to go, but please go or you pay for it later, a lesson I am learning at the finish of my freshman year. Thanks! Best of luck! I think that's around the same time I registered last year, which was a little late, but also not the latest. I need up getting stuck with mostly morning classes to begin with, but when registration opened up again after move-in day I was able to switch those morning classes for later ones. Even if you ultimately end up with morning classes, you'll be able to figure it out. You'll be fine. It's a decent date. I believe they go all the way up to August. But as a freshman, you don't have very much choice your first semester, it's more of a given. <eos> \",\n",

Some campus computers have it to use; I know that some of the UGL computers have the full Adobe suite. Engineers used to be able to use it via Citrix for free. Otherwise, you end up signing up for creative cloud (which you can do from the webstore, though I don't know the rate difference between that and adobe's website).

I open them with the intention of a 5 minute break and somehow end up spending 3-5 hours in succession on it doing absolutely nothing. And I will force myself to close it but then I get impatient and feel the need to check it repeatedly. Does anyone else have this problem? What should I do? It's really getting in the way of me studying for big tests, keeping up with classes etc. The top reply was: I'd say I'm slightly like you but I don't keep much friends on social media so i don't scroll down to oblivion. I deleted both my Instagram (I had main and spam account) as well as my Facebook two weeks ago. By far the best decision I've made. I got so distracted and it really fucked with my attention span so that's what I did. I got reddit only because of the school community and the possibility of getting good advice from fellow students in UIUC. So I don't use it much at all. And the only other form of social media I have is Snapchat but that's only because that's my form of text messaging. Deleting everything really helps. It's like a clean slate for you. You should try it. Since I feel like Facebook is kind of necessary in that people make groups for certain things related to organizations and classes, I'm going to make a new one but keep it super empty and private and don't have friends on there and just join groups whenever it facilitates communication or learning. Check out this video from Tom Frank that I found helpful, there are lots of tools you can use to block Facebook/Twitter/Reddit etc: [url link] He has a lot of other great video/podcast content on motivation hacking and focus as well: [url link] Sorry to hijack your thread op..  Is there a way on Facebook to only see status updates or posted pictures by my friends? I currently see what my friends like or what they got commented on / tagged in, I wish not to see these things anymore.  Is it me or has Facebook gone down hill recently? I remember when the interface was so simple and easy to navigate.  Sorry to op for not adding anything useful to your problem. Not sure if this is common knowledge, but I didn't know this until recently... Google Chrome has a StayFocused app-thing that you can use to block certain sites completely, or create a timer for the max amount of time you can spend on them. <eos> \",\n",

I am really interested in this area but I would like a little heads up before I dive into this lab. Thanks! The top reply was: It was pretty easy. For the lab we'd go to the child care center across from the school of social work building and work with the kids there 2-4 times a semester. Otherwise, we would just listen to lectures in class. First test average was a 93%.  We did have a group project--but you graded your group members on how well they did/the effort they made. I appreciated that we were able to make our group members accountable for their work.  Overall, take it. It's easy and fun. Ok cool thanks! I was hoping this lab would be there at some point. I will definitely take it then! So you have an interest in taking child development lab, but it sounds like you're a little hesitant to just go for it. Let's talk about that, for a bit. Edit: Serious answer, just [schedule a tour]([url link] so you can see for yourself. <eos> \",\n",

Easier to ask questions and stuff. mcdonald's 347H covers pretty much all 347 material in half a semester then moves on to some extra stuff.

The top reply was: Then don't go to lecture. This is college. You are supposed to figure out what works best for you and not what works best for other people. Not a student, but can confirm from my own college days that this can indeed happen depending on the instructor and class. I had a few profs that basically read the textbook aloud for each lecture, and it was better to just spend the same amount of time studying on your own. Do go to their office hours if you don't understand something though. Had her last term, had the same experience and just didn't go to any lecture 1/3 into the term. that's fine, i don't go to any of my non required attendance classes since I find that I end up not paying attention even if I do attend, might as well just study in my apt or at the library :b Alright, just wanted to know how things turned out for others if they skipped her lectures.

Where can I go to get all the repairs done without worrying about being overcharged? The top reply was: Neutral is convenient since it’s right on Green. Bakers is good also. Durst=Worst Check out thebikeproject.org If you're reasonably inclined, you could do all that stuff yourself in less than an hour. If that's too far for you I found Neutral more reasonable priced than Durst. But yeah, Baker's is probably the best value. Seconded, if you're willing to work on it yourself. Both locations are run by friendly, knowledgeable people and they sell parts at very reasonable prices. The membership price is basically their tuition cost plus in-shop tool rental for a year. If you keep asking questions, it's worth every penny. <eos> \",\n",

It helps get rid of the jitters before you talk to the reps, and will give you a good opportunity to refine your elevator pitch. Who knows, you may make a new friend or a new professional connection that you may leverage in the future. Edit - A word Definitely, I got an interview once from just talking to a guy in line.

I read in an email to CS+x students that it was supposed to happen this semester, but lack of enrollment had it cancelled. The top reply was: CS 240 is a merger of CS 233+241 for certain CS+X programs where the degree doesn't require as much low-level systems/architecture as a pure CS degree and, instead, spends the extra 4 credit hours on a more application-focused area. The last I heard, the first pilot course is planned for Spring 2018. Same 😷 Was it sent to a specific subset of CS+X students, cause i certainly haven't received the email.

I am currently a rising senior (doing a semester long co-op at a major avionics firm a few hours away from campus). I hope to someday work at an exciting aerospace company (like SpaceX) doing software dev/firmware engineering. I would like to work under a professor (do research) during my last two semesters at UIUC. Has anyone done this before? What professors are good to work with to achieve this final goal? How did you/should I reach out to them and word my email?  Hope my question wasn't too vague and thanks a lot! :) The top reply was: Join illini solar car. They do a shitload of aero research, even to the extent of designing evolutionary algorithms to optimize airfoil design. And every board is C++ embedded MCU controlled, needs good firmware. I heard working at SpaceX is awful. Seems like a continuation of undergrad with the amount of hours you work, and for basically nothing. Fuck that. Sounds interesting. Do you know if I can join in January since I'm doing a co-op this semester? Or would I have to wait until Fall 2018? You can definitely join next spring! We'll be in full on design mode for one car next spring and optimization for the other so we've got lots to do! I'm not sure yet if we'll be running traditional info sessions like we do in the fall but either way just [get in touch]([url link] when you are back to school. If we do have info sessions they'll be announced on our [facebook]([url link] and [twitter]([url link] pages. Great, thanks! <eos> \",\n",

I have been on probation before a year and a half ago but got off of it. I am actually doing pretty well in the other classes and I am sure that I would be over at least a 1 on my semester gpa and over 2 on my overall gpa with the school but under 2 for my semester GPA. My question to you good people today is that has anyone ever been on academic probation more than once? I have to say I am pretty worried that they are just going to kick me out for doing bad in one class. I have also had some health issues over the semester that have definitely not helped. Thanks for your time The top reply was: Well I hope you are healthy then. I'm not making excuses. Sorry I had a legitimate worry about my academic future endeavors at the school You'll probably get the best response from your academic advisor. Requirements and expectations vary greatly between degree programs. I've been on probation multiple times, and I will be graduating next Fall (one semester late). You won't get dropped from the university unless you end up on academic probation for two consecutive semesters. Go talk to someone in your college office. They are the ones who do academic standing reviews, and it is much easier for things to go well for you if they have met with you. They don't look as kindly on students who slink off and hide, hoping that nothing goes wrong and that they will never need to talk about their problems. Go to them and talk earnestly about your situation. Good luck! <eos> \",\n",

Does anyone know of an active club/a group of people here that storm chases? The top reply was: There is a storm observing course that is offered through the university. It is led by Dr. Jeff Frame and it's a blast. I have gone twice and have seen 6 tornadoes. Basically, he takes you and a group of students out on to the great plains where you get to practice nowcasting and forecasting. The informational meeting is Thursday night at 7PM in 1071 Natural History Building. I think the course a prerequisite of ATMS 201 but if you are super passionate about it he could probably make an exception. If you can't make it to the meeting you can talk to him in person on the third floor of NHB. A lot of ATMS students regularly go out when there is a good storm setup. Only can really go on local chases due to school. I saw one tornado chasing by myself in 2016 and have been out a few times last semester. Haven't had a good set up yet this semester. Contact Prof. Eric Snodgrass. He's a big strorm chaser and might let you tag along. Yes, but it's a Storm Powerwalking club - so the storms often get away, but we maintain better knee health.

              " \"<bos> I'm thinking of getting a longboard for next year, as my apartment will be a little further from campus. What are the rules regarding long boards? Do you ride on the sidewalk, bike lanes, street, or any combination of those? Do you follow the same rules as bikes with regards to one-way streets and such? I've seen people pulled over on bikes, but do the same rules apply to skating? I'm assuming there's no rules about bringing it into class with you and putting it in front of your chair?  Any bits of advice on generally accepted etiquette?  Thanks! The top reply was: get a bike, its cheaper, faster, and more useful. And bulkier, harder to store, and it has to be chained up and left outside wherever you park it. There are reason's for both. I had a bike and a long board my freshmen year but got fed up with dealing with my bike so I never brought it back. My current board was about $120, which is far cheaper than any bike I've seen, even at Walmart. He asked for advice, not for you to bash of longboards. Both boards and bikes have pros and cons. Either are good options, it just depends on your personal preferences. I try to ride in the bike lanes whenever possible. You're going about the same speed as the bikers so you are less likely to cause or be slowed by traffic. If someone is going faster than you' let them pass. If I have a biker breathing down my neck I try to get out of the way so they can get to where they are going. If you haven't skated before, I would recommend learning somewhere other than campus. All of the traffic, pedestrian or otherwise, it is much more difficult to ride around here than back home. Almost every skateboarder/longboarder I've encountered on campus are assholes who have a complete disregard for others...just because they can get away with it. I even saw one guy blow a red light at Wright  Green and then proceed ride up the wrong side of the street. ALL WHILE WEARING EARPHONES. I hope someone runs him over. Anyway, I digress. I would suggest following all the rules of the road and avoid riding on the sidewalk, especially if it's crowded. LOL that was probably me <eos> \",\n",

My question is though if the grade in the class is counted into my GPA? I'm a bit confused on that part. I would think it's not? The top reply was: Nope. GPA is sum of all your quality hours divided by your total credit hours. Number of quality hours for each class is the number of credit hours for that class multiplied by the grade you got (i.e. A = 4.0, B = 3.0, and so on). The class gives you 0 quality hours and doesn't affect your total number of credit hours, and so will have no effect on your GPA. Ask an advisor. It will still appear on your transcript though. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Favorite customer interaction ever. I went there really late once and we were able to get pizzas for 2-3 bucks each paying in cash. Is this a normal thing? Depends on the amount of customers and who is managing. We keep a record of how many pizza we sold each night and we try to make a similar amount; if we made more pizzas than we need or we have pizzas that have been laying around for a while we will sell it pretty cheap just to get rid of it. This goes for slices and throughtout the day. For managers, some will just give a discount for the hell of it and other will just be pretty strict. There are times where I got jipped when I was trying to buy pizza drunk, it all depends on who is at the register. **tl;dr** if you got it real late, then we probably had some extra made and wanted to get rid of it for something. Kind of uncommon. Crazy customer/ drunk customer stories? Somewhat. I think Antonio's was the only place on campus that sold slices . When they shut down, we started to sell slices and I think One World is the only place selling slices on campus now but I could be wrong.

I refused to tell him because I don't know why he would need to know that, and then he just handed me a booklet of coupons for Suburban Express. To make things even creepier, I saw him not 5 minutes later doing the same thing at the next stop! And, as we were waiting to leave, he just stood there and stared into the windows of the bus until we left. This all made me very uncomfortable lol.

If you're interested in contributing leave a comment and we can come up with a plan. Otherwise I'd love to hear any and all input on worthwhileness of the wiki. The top reply was: I'd love it if people put in this effort. There was some as the wiki came out, but enthusiasm died off quickly. A great place to start is with the sidebar content. Cleaning up / updating some information on those topics would be great. If you do, please modmail me and I'll update the sidebar. Also, there are some minor restrictions that prevent new accounts and ones that haven't posted much in /r/uiuc from editing the wiki.

Does anyone know whom to contact about that? The top reply was: Download the app PulsePoint. It gives you the locations of all AED's on campus. Uh oh, are you having a heart attack? Honestly, the whole point of AEDs is that they don't need training. The training is just a good idea. But they're also very expensive, so they don't usually just leave them lying around. Anyway, it sounds like someone was able to help get you your answer already. Cheers! Training is for liability reasons. I hope not!

I know it's probably too early to expect a response with the weekend, but if you work there how long did it take you to hear back about your application?

I finished the project so would it be okay for me to ask the professor during office hours to mock grade the project. I need to literally get a 75/75 on this project to keep my A therefore need to get a perfect score.  -There are no TA\\'s in this class -I have been to her office hours before, if that makes a difference -I don\\'t want to be annoying or come of as a grade grubber Thanks for commenting!  The top reply was: Yes, you should absolutely go. Most professors are more than willing to do this. They generally won\\'t mock grade it, but they will certainly offer feedback. Especially if it\\'s a gen ed, since not a lot of people go to gen ed office hours. Echoing the other responses here, but also want to add: Make sure you frame why you are coming within the \"wanting to do your best work\" context. The absolute worst thing to do is to go in saying \"I need X grade to get an A in the course\" especially during finals time. Every professor/instructor/TA fields dozens of questions and complaints about last-minute assignments, and get myriad students trying to nickel and dime their way to a better grade when they could have stopped in for feedback on work earlier in the semester. I\\'m not saying that\\'s what you\\'re doing, as it sounds like you worked ahead and want to get feedback. You should totally go to office hours, just make sure you don\\'t sound like you\\'re trying to manipulate a certain grade from the visit. I\\'ve heard of professors proofreading papers, offering pointers, etc. Just make sure you ask. You don\\'t want to just email your paper only to learn he will no longer accept it for credit, or worse take your half finished project and consider it your final one. if looking over your project will take a substantial amount of time, and won\\'t benefit other students who might come to office hours, it may be better to email in advance and ask when would be good to get project feedback - office hours or some other appointment. That gives your professor flexibility to set a time when they\\'ll be able to really get into what you\\'ve done without worry about distractions. <eos> ',\n",

Can you guys recommend where I can stay for that 3 days in or near the university?

[url link] Additionally Hampton Inn has a hotel immediately north of the engineering campus. So about 4 blocks from The Union - so very close. thx guys. I think for my budget airbnb is the finest choice and it is possible for me to go in Daniels or Sherman so yeah. thank you all~ Union hotel. It's pricy but it's on campus. You could also stay at a hotel off campus. Slightly related, but maybe try to find an AirBnB? If you're really desperate, post on Facebook (probably the Free  For Sale UIUC Group or Housing UIUC Group) and find someone's couch to sleep on for a few days.  Obviously it's kind of sketchy, but will probably be 1/3 the cost of a hotel <eos> \",\n",

Is there anyone out there who has taken an online course at UIUC before? Specifically the self-paced math ones. I'd like to hear what your thoughts on it were, like how was taking it compared to a regular class? Is it worth taking it or should I possibly explore doing it at a community college over the summer? Any online-course related advice is very much appreciated!  Thanks! The top reply was: expensive as hell I took Calc 3 over last summer online as a self-paced course. There's no lectures so you're expected to teach yourself from the Mathematica code.Although, you do have a mentor helping you out with anything you don't understand. If you're comfortable doing that and do not struggle with timing your exams and submitting assignments on time, you'll be fine.Once you have the hang of it, you're golden. Assignments are 50% of the grade btw. Community college, tends to be easier and less expensive. That is in intersting situation. <eos> \",\n",

Up until about a week ago, my bill on my Comcast account reflected what was negotiated. Today, I checked my bill because I wanted to pay ahead for this month - they decided to double my charges. No notification whatsoever, directly against what I have in hard copy (I printed out the online chat scripts). So yea, tomorrow I\\'m gonna head over to the Comcast store and be belligerent.  Check your bill!!!!  The top reply was: Also be careful if you speak with a representative and they ask if you want to pay your bill over the phone. It\\'s convenient, but you will be charged a \"service fee\" (they didn\\'t tell me about this). You\\'re probably getting 75 down but just losing it wirelessly.

Most people have a 2.4ghz band that gets very congested in apartment buildings. The 5ghz is relatively untapped. I get 70 throughout the apartment How long have you had service? Their main strategy is to promise a certain rate for about six months if you sign up for a one- or two-year contract. They usually sweeten the initial offering with additional discounts on DVR, HD and hardware fees and one premium channel like HBO or Showtime. Once the promotional period expires, those all go poof at once, and your basic rate jumps $30 to $50 a month too. Your best option if this is the case is to ask about any promotions and say you\\'ll have to cancel otherwise because it\\'s too expensive. The lady at the Urbana office dropped me back down to my original rate, discounted all my additional fees and gave me six months of HBO for free because I asked nicely that way. Now, if they just arbitrarily raised your rate, and the ladies in Urbana aren\\'t helpful, then give \\'em a piece of your mind. But remember, they\\'re just being paid peanuts to serve as the face for their dickhead bosses\\' actions, so chewing them out isn\\'t going to accomplish much. <eos> ',\n",

I feel that we should take some sort of action, but I'm not sure what we can do as students. Thoughts? The top reply was: Too bad the instructor is just a visiting lecturer who is also sarcastic... I missed class Friday and he signed on irc in the middle and called me the resident brony ;__; I'm not even a brony Verbal abuse seems to me to be inappropriate behavior for a TA. Have you thought about contacting the instructor for the course and voicing your concerns? If you're not comfortable with that, please message me. Yeah he just seems really sarcastic about everything. Regardless I don't think that kind of behavior is appropriate for a TA either. I would talk to the instructor of the course about this.

Also not looking to spend a ton of money. I've looked in most of the stores in the mall, plus all the campus clothing stores. No dice, most dresses are too revealing for my taste. Any recommendations for stores I should be looking at? I've had bad experiences with online shopping so preferably something in town.  The top reply was: Most women don't wear anything particulatly fancy for graduation since the gowns are hot and uncomfortable and most of your clothes will be covered. When I graduated a lot of women wore a knee length or full length solid colored sundress (and I think if you can just find a nice looking shell or very light cardigan to wear with it would be fine). I used to go to the Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity, and Salvation Army thrift stores for a lot of my clothes since it's easier to find not too new (aka too skimpy) clothes from those places.! There is a consignment stored (very gently used clothing) in Country Fair mall on Mattis Ave - Karen's Closet - which might have what you are looking for. Talbot's and Chico's on Kirby at Mattis may also be good places to check. Also by the Schnucks in Urbana there is an upscale thrift store. They only take new/brand name/much higher quality clothes, so there's a good chance you'll find a nicer dress there. Goodluck! Also Checkered Moon which is in the same strip. Hadn't tried the thrift stores yet, that's a great idea. Thank you! <eos> \",\n",

I\\'m talking about the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 15\" model is 4 pounds, while the 13\" model is 3 pounds.  The top reply was: I\\'d go with the fifteen inch for the much larger and easier to work with screen and its discrete graphics and the standard i7 it comes with if I were buying a MacBook Pro.  I highly recommend actually checking one out in person perhaps at an Apple store in Chicagoland before you do buy it though, just to get a feel of how it feels, especially with the odd butterfly switches they\\'re using now. And the new trackpad on it is yuuuge. I\\'d also recommend checking out the new Dell XPS 15 if you\\'re not hardcore into Apple. It\\'s a really well built, sleek and powerful machine. What about flexing? You can\\'t flex with an i5 If the 2016 model is the one with only usb-c ports, Id go with the 2015 model. The newer one is more expensive for a less functional laptop in my opinion. I have a 13\\'\\' and its works perfectly for what I use it for. If money isn\\'t a problem though id go with the 15\" for the i7. You did mention weight though and with the 13\", a case on it, notebooks, and school supplies, it gets heavy relatively quickly in a backpack. An i5 will probably grant better battery life, and an i7 is overkill. Unless you\\'re doing something very specific, you\\'ll never really need an i7 for anything. Justin Long recommends both.

Is anyone else with US Cellular experiencing similar problems or is it just my phone? The top reply was: Spent all day with them yesterday. The problem is that US Cellular has decommissioned/sold some of their towers in this area to Sprint. They are still in the process of shutting down the tower and that is where our problem comes in. Our phones are defaulting to that tower instead of entering roaming mode. The nearest dedicated USC tower is in Danville. I took their shitty advice, drove to Danville and updated the tower list by calling *228. Do not waste your time doing this, it will fix nothing. You will be able to place calls while on that tower, but not when you get back to the CU area. They could not give me an ETA of when it would be done but said if they received two more complaints, the issue would be bumped up in priority and addressed immediately. Edit: Allegedly USC contacted everyone that had a phone number corresponding to an area where they had sold off towers. I am still on my parents account from Peoria, so they did not let us know about this... It definitely has nothing to do with how \"inept\" we are and everything to do with the fact many US Cellular users are permanent residents in other parts of the State not in the affected area, therefore there wasn\\'t much of a reason we would be notified of the changes anyway.  Lucky you for receiving a notification and not being currently phone-less in Champaign. Did you just update your phone? I have heard there was a problem with the last android update on Samsung phones. Well we should be able to still roam here but we get nothing instead. US Cellular has millions of customers. They most likely only sent warnings to people from the area to be affected by the change, which many of us are not as we only come here for school. It has nothing to do with how \"inept\" we may or may not be. <eos> ',\n",

Also, if there is enough of us, we should bring our 3DSs to a reddit meetup for some major mariokarting smackdown. The top reply was: I have a 3DS and I need more heroes to beat Find Mii. Let's have a streetpass party! I don't even know what a streetpass is, but I'm upvoting out of jealousy. I'm all for mario kart. I'm really enjoying that game As for places to streetpass: during last semester, I ran into a lot of people at Loomis, and then on my way from there to Altgeld. go to your Mii Plaza -- if you enable Streetpass, you can add the Miis who pass you with your game console in the system's games of Puzzle Swap and Find Mii. I have no idea what you guys are talking about... but I wish I did considering I have a 3DS... <eos> \",\n",

Lastly, there are directions to get tickets for the Illinois Soccer Stadium on its [website]([url link] but then the evenue ticketing website says all soccer and track event are always free. Which one is true? The top reply was: The stadium is located on Florida Ave and Wright St., across from the cemetery.

              " \"<bos> I'm currently in Engineering, planning to graduate in Fall 2017. I have 20 credit hours remaining, and I'd like to allocate this as 9 this semester and 11 in Fall 2017. The difference is $3,000 vs if I do 12 and 8.  Unfortunately, I spoke to an advisor who said this is not allowed. The Dean apparently gets pissed if underloading to save money is brought up, and they threatened to put me on probation if I don't take 12 credits. My question is: does this matter? I don't plan on going to grad school; besides, shouldn't it be immediately obvious to anyone looking at my transcript that I'm not on probation for failing?  So what are the consequences of this? I feel like probation for this is worth $3,000; unless anyone has good reasons against? The top reply was: Make sure it doesn't affect any of your financial aid. If your loan requires you to be a full-time student with 12 credits, I bet the difference is more than $3,000 if you have to pay tuition without a loan.  as long as you don't shout from the roof tops that you're doing this to save money I find it hard to believe that the university could legally drop a student for shouting **anything** from the rooftops, unless they were _literally_ shouting from the rooftops, in which case they might have the student arrested for trespassing. [url link] Just do it. They can't stop you if you're graduating. You'll just have to meet with them before registering for fall probably. Worst case scenario, you can just register for 14 and drop back down to 11 before the semester starts. I know you can underload your final semester without any issues. Not sure about other semesters. Can you take a full load now and even more underload the fall? There are tuition ranges depending on hours taken, so you could possibly save the same amount of money just in one semester instead of over two I don't have any loans or financial aid, so that shouldn't be a problem... <eos> \",\n",

Their spirits haven't been crushed to depression and apathy yet. Chill bro/bra. Just make sure you get some Twin XL sheets for your dorm and worry about homework when school actually starts.

The manager interview went ok as well. I didn't get the job, because my background isn't really full of the data stuff they were looking for.

I have contacted the professor, but is there someone else that I should be reaching out to?  Let me know, thanks everybody! The top reply was: Screenshot or document the error somehow Your professor will need to contact the Office of the Registrar to have it changed. It will take a few weeks to be updated. edit: contact the department if your professor isn't responding. Had this issue last year. Documented it and calculated everything per the syllabus to show. I had to stay on top of the situation with a TA because the teacher went abroad the following semester and it took almost the entire semester to change it, but it worked out. Good Luck! <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: CRCE pool Just grab a bucket of water from your home. Using running water for that is unnecessary. Or even just wipe down the bicycle with a wet cloth. Go to a do-it-yourself car wash, like the one on Neil just south of St. Mary's. I have lots of bikes that get way dirty (mountain biking, cyclocross in the mud, etc.) and that's what I did before I bought a house. Maybe run a long tube from the water outlet of your house/apartment to the outside and wash your bike with it. <eos> \",\n",

I've seen a cat roaming near high and coler, but im not sure on color since it's been dark out when i've seen it. cmon about an hour ago Indoor cats usually go to ground once lost, he'll be in the immediate area if he's an indoor cat.

Do not call them by their first name unless they say it's okay. Dr. is usually also fine, but some people who lecture courses don't actually have PhDs. It is particularly galling for some women when they repeatedly get called 'Ms/Mrs,' they have a PhD, and they've corrected the student. One of my old friends told me he did that one time because it pissed him off that she corrected him calling her Ms., and it made me think a little less of him. Professor is standard, it's better to call them doctor if they qualify though. Never call them by their first name or Mr unless they say it's ok. Most TA's will introduce themselves with, and prefer to go by, their first name. Yeah, they are. That's not their official job title, but it is their job. Even if you're a grad student, starting with professor is a safe bet unless they tell you to do so otherwise This is true. But the word 'Professor' as used in the classroom is functionally different than 'Professor' as an academic title / rank. Some people (some professors / grad students who want to go on to be professors) get their jimmies rustled over this, but I just don't give a shit. <eos> \",\n",

I found myself having to teach myself a lot of it, but it's not hard material to pick up. If you've taken Stat 100 or 200 you'll recognize enough to get by, though the book does over complicate some topics. Pm me and I'll send you some notes to help get ahead. Yinxiao Huang section wasn't any better. Easy material made hard with poorly written questions. Not hard given the material but the final is 40%, and since you can replace your semester grade with it she makes it pretty hard ~mean:70-75...I scored a little above it, but I given I had scored a 99 and 85 on the midterms I was a little salty about losing an A. im taking with Huang next semester how hard is that class? I am a stats major, I've taken 200. It was a cakewalk, hopefully 400 won't be that bad. Edit: Was originally registered with her...moved to Culpepper's lecture. <eos> \",\n",

My thoughts are that when there are 5 minutes or less left in the game, someone, anyone, needs to take the initiative and take the clipboards AWAY from BOTH Webber and Zook, and escort them immediately to their respective locker rooms. Their inability to manage the game, the team, or the clock in close or even not close situations is horrifying. Better recruits than Turner, worse game management, same-ish results, ready for a change. For Florida, Zook was the mistake between Spurrier and Meyer and it *only* took them 3 years to figure that out... <eos> \",\n",

Free account, and ATMs all over the place. Plus you can continue using it after college since Chase is a pretty national bank. Chase is what I was leaning towards. I just want to know if anyone knew what the new bank will be before I open up an account. I prefer chase. It's free and they have ATMs on Campus. I don't know if there is going to be a new bank because as of last week, the bank area was taken down and replaced with Illinois merchandise. If you end up opening an account with Chase, be sure to find a coupon code like get $150 for new customers. <eos> \",\n",

I'd like to give as much practical advice as possible, so I'd like some feedback on things that you wish you knew/were stressed as a freshman that could have helped you academically, socially, economically, etc. For example here's a few things I've got so far: CARE tutoring, safe rides, getting involved early, scheedule.com, not buying textbooks from campus bookstores, free stuff at McKinley I'm curious to see what everyone has learned since their first day here. What useful campus advice would you give to freshmen? The top reply was: What you get out of your time here is directly proportional to the amount of effort you put into being an active participant. You can't come here and be like you are on autopilot. Be interested and actively pursue the things you feel passionately about. Your future will be greatly affected by what you do here so take control, explore and build. 1) Talk to your professors. In person. 2) Yes, dammit, your grades DO matter. That I could make a lot more money if I had studied welding instead of art. 1. Study before class, otherwise you probably won't understand anything 2. Go to class, otherwise you won't understand anything. Learn things lecture-to-lecture and not test-to test 3. Explore your interests. Even if you're not in DGS, you should explore possible interests in other majors before you become a junior and get stuck in the major you're in. 4. Get involved in something. It doesn't matter if it's your dorm hall, cultural rsos, academic rsos. 5. Do side projects. If you're having a hard time with getting them going, join the corresponding engineering rso(ACM for CS majors, IEEE for ECE majors, etc) How difficult it is to get a decent paying job with room for advancement in the humanities. <eos> \",\n",

A better use of your time is to research, or work on personal projects that will look good on your resume, even a minor boost your GPA is worth more than the $500 you'll make doing this. Helps out in labs and during office hours. I make triple that for only around 8-10hrs a week. Also, being a CA for a course that you really enjoy and in a field you want to work in (or perhaps a fundamental course) looks great on your resume, it's not as two-sided as you make it seem.

Besides clearly being an expert in the content area, he is a very kind person who has the interest of his students at heart. You will not be at a disadvantage in any way by taking the course with him as opposed to Jeff. The two of them certainly have their own teaching styles, but I believe both versions of the course will be equally good. Mahesh is definitely a fantastic instructor! He clearly knows his stuff, is very good at explaining concepts, regularly solves examples and seems like a very humble guy! I haven't taken the class with him but I have friends that took the class with him a few semesters ago and they had really good things to say about him :) <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Anyone major in undergraduate Creative Writing or taken Creative Writing classes and can share their opinion?  The top reply was: I am a creative writing major here. Most of the classes you'll take are English and Literature classes though. I love the creative writing courses. They are workshops. I'm on the short fiction track and you usually write 3 short stories a semester and spend most of the class time critiquing and having an open dialogue about what other people wrote. The workshops can be intimidating at first, but I find them helpful. I've liked all of my professors so far as well. Creative Writing major here. I love it, the professors are pretty great for the most part. Sometimes there are screenwriting classes offered, so if you want to experiment with that you can and get credit (I'm pretty sure you have to take a 100 level CW class first though). Double majored with Spanish and got to study abroad and work translation for a magazine. So far, so good for me, met some great people and made some good connections. However, I will say that I'm nervous for job prospects after college (like pretty much everyone else). Hoping to work in publishing, currently interning. Regarding jobs, it will probably depend on what exactly you plan on double majoring in and whether or not you plan on going to grad school. Internships always help. Do you double major in anything else? <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Just looking to review 173 and already read Prof Flecks book. I saw CS 70 at Berkeley and CS 6.042J at MIT. Are there any others that are better, if not, which one relates closely to ours?  The top reply was: Depends what you are interested in.  Last time I looked, the MIT course did stuff roughly similar to ours but with more programming language applications (e.g. think CS 421).  Also, their textbook and Rosen's are more comprehensive, which is bad when you go through the first time but good if you want more details on core discrete math topics.  Rosen is a bit dated but makes a nice reference and used copies are easy to get cheap. Berkeley's course assumes a lot more math and looks generally harder.  It seems to have a strong focus on number theory and probability. Martin Liebeck's textbook is good if your interests run towards pure math, e.g. algebra and analysis.   CMU has a second course that does a high-level review of CS theory ideas. IMO if you've read and understood the book you should be fine. Which book by Rosen should I be looking into? Discrete Mathematics and its Applications 7th edition. Does that look right? I am looking to supplement CS 173 and your textbook. I'd check transfer.org . I used that website to find a lot of my transfer classes. They might have something for CS173. You basically just have to enter what school you're from and what class you need to take and it'll tell you which institutions have the equivalent class that will transfer over. I've personally taken the equivalent of CS473 at IIT. Not sure what their equivalent of 173 is, though, if they have one. I'd check the website to get exact results haha Not a course, but discrete mathematics demystified by Steven Krantz is great and seems to have similarities with the order of Prof Fleck's book. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Out of curiosity where did you get the the 360? A friend of mine had that kind of mod and I'm interested in one for mine. Possibly. What games? any game you want. want the hot new games? buy yourself the right blank cd's take a trip down to thepiratebay dl the game, burn the game to the disk and put the disk in your 360 and enjoy it only works with 360's like his though Yea, I was just hoping someone would have a few controllers and games with it. You can get a barebones console for $22, but the hassle of going through it all....I'd rather just trade the 360 I never use anyway. <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> Anyone have any recommendations for good art or design classes? Maybe something about product design, or about typography - anything that is different from engineering classes but is still useful and fun. Any class, regardless of college it falls under, is ok with me. I have a good experience in photoshop (some illustrator) if that helps at all The top reply was: I took Typography(ARTD215) course last year, and really loved it. However, it is for second year graphic design major only, and I was the only non-graphic design major. If you're passionate enough and can persuade an instructor to give you a registration override, I would recommend you to do that. It's a really good course to be introduced to graphic design tools like Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, and it was the best course I've ever taken at UIUC. I also heard at the end of last year that graphic design department is devising a new course targeted to non-majors who are interested in design. Awesome thanks - it actually looks like it's open for non-majors too? [url link] Maybe they changed the policy for next semester How much time do you remember it taking you a week? I spent 6-9 hours outside of class per week... It did not feel like much time for me, because it mostly had to do with playing with a software like InDesign and create something cool. So if I have no previous experience with any of these programs, would I struggle to learn how to use them? <eos> \",\n",

              " '<bos> I revived a Massmail today that reads-- Dear Campus Colleagues: On February 5, President Killeen sent an email notifying you of the “Preventing Discrimination and Sexual Violence” training program. This program presents a comprehensive discussion about how to recognize and respond to all forms of sex-based discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. If you have not completed the training, you must do so by tomorrow, March 30 at 5:00 p.m. You can access the training here. Problem is, I searched and I never received an email from Killeen on the 5th. I\\'m not opposed to the idea but it seems like a little much to expect 40,000+ people to do this in 1 day.  The top reply was: Yeah I was about to post this too.. Never got the first email. What the heck, was this mis-sent? I also can\\'t log in on the site: The link in the email is this:[url link] Which takes you to this: [url link] It seems to be for UIC students not UIUC students... Can\\'t log in with my AD credentials.  Also I\\'m a senior and graduating in may, I already completed the required training thing my freshman year, so why is everyone getting this email now? Edit: Also the website says this, \"This course was designed for use by UIS undergraduate students enrolled for the Spring 2016 semester and is available online for a 30 day window (2/15/16 - 3/15/16)\" Definitely seems like an incorrectly sent email... This should\\'ve only been sent to faculty/staff. Completion of the program was mandatory for us. I\\'m not sure if student workers, TA, RA, etc. need to complete it as well, but you should ask your manager and/or adviser. If you don\\'t work for the university, don\\'t worry about it. It seems to have been sent to everyone in error. Hopping on this comment to add what my office figured out today (we all got the email and don\\'t have to do it either). If you have to do the training, you would have received a unique username and password to login, which is different from any login you use on campus. If you didn\\'t get the previous emails, don\\'t worry about it.  If you think you\\'re supposed to and are still unsure contact your supervisor or HR person. The prior e-mails I received about this training said it was highly encouraged, but not mandatory. I\\'m surprised you even received an email because nobody else seems to have received anything. <eos> ',\n",

Unfortunately, I have a class conflict.  There are ~150 seats remaining as of right now. I would post this to piazza for cs advising I do not know unfortunately sorry Again, CompE is ruled out. Okay incoming MS CS student here, can it be used as a part of bredth requirement or specialization requirement ? If No, can I still take the course ?

The top reply was: In addition to Upper Bout, There's Corson's Music up at 1st and University. Lou DiBello does lessons for $20/half hour. My recommendation would be the Upper Bout over on Neil. It's a really cool little guitar shop, and they offer a variety of different lessons. I think their lessons are something like $20/half hour. A bit expensive, but probably the best place in town. The guitar center, which is off of Prospect, does lessons too! Dude's intense. <eos> \",\n",

Any and all help is much appreciated! The top reply was: Also if anyone has any suggestions for clubs/activities/social groups that don't drink, or don't necessarily revolve around alcohol, I'd appreciate that as well. I'm trying to build a social circle that is either dry or concerned with maintaining sobriety. I highly recommend [the CU Swing Society]([url link] I find that most people who give it a try find it to be really fun! They have a free dance every week at the Union (so obviously no alcohol there), and in the 4+ years that I've been a part of the scene, from going to afterparties, carpooling to workshops and dances in other states, or just hanging out with other dancers, it seems to me that the world of swing dancing can be surprisingly dry for being such a social, dance kind of activity, which I really like as I don't drink too.  Also, a friend of mine happens to be one of the people in charge of an AA chapter in Champaign that I believe is called [The Fellowship Circle]([url link] (it's right next to the El Toro by Neil). If you'd like, I could give you his contact info. Walk in or call the campus counseling center. I'm sure they are well equipped to help. A good friend of mine from back in the dorms is now in AA and I'm proud of him for getting his life back together. Good luck to you. haha part of being an alcoholic is not getting back into drinking I'm afraid. Moderation isn't in an alcoholic's vocabulary. Abstinence is though! You'll understand it eventually, or not. But you're far from understanding it now. Thank you :) I'm proud of your friend as well! It takes a big person to admit they're powerless over alcohol while in college. I know it took me forever to admit to myself that I'm an alcoholic and I need help every day. <eos> \",\n",

In the event of nuclear holocaust, the University of Illinois will operate on a 2 hour delay. Otherwise, put on your long undies because you're going to class.  Sincerely, Phyllis M. Wise.

I started out at the end of my freshman year @ 125 lbs barely able to squat/bench/deadlift ... just got back a week and a half ago from a national meet setting all my weight classes' junior records (123.5 lbs class). I've learned a lot from these people and if I was on campus, I'd be there lifting and helping with them, but alas, AZ has me. Do it, easily one of the best decisions I made my college career. for sure man, we haven't really had great long-term turnouts from quad-day in the past, so when they told us there wasn't much room left, we just decided on no booth.  we should have some flyers up in the arc in the near future, with meeting info and such. When do you all lift? Are there meets? How often do you lift and what type of lifts are trained? We haven't had an official meeting yet this year, but feel free to PM with any questions.  Our current website is at [url link] -explore it a litte. Most of the info on the team is years old, but the lifting information is all very relevant.  Also, if anyone is looking to start lifting, just throw me a PM and we can try to get together in the gym. Currently we haven't put together this years lifting squads, but in the past we've had 2 different squads lifting 4 days a week. We'll likely schedule a meeting in the near future.  Competing in meets is encouraged but not necessary. The lifts competed in are the Bench, Squat, and Deadlift, in terms of one-rep maxes.

The worst part is I have exactly no time at all to enjoy the beautiful weather of my favorite season, any Homecoming or Halloween festivities, my favorite team in my favorite sport in a historic World Series appearance, and, to top it all off, my 21st birthday this weekend. Maybe I'm just being a bitch, but it's seriously killing me how little I get to enjoy life lately. I like the major that I chose (engineering), and it's something I'm willing to sacrifice for, but sometimes it feels like the classes I take and the ones who run them have no regard for other aspects of a student's life. The top reply was: What's wrong with you dude We all feel the same. The last time I went out with my friends was more than a month ago, and it's driving me crazy, and it seems like this streak will continue for at least another two weeks. Actually to be fair most people really don't know what they signed up for. Most high schools don't have the resources to even remotely prepare students for colleges, let alone prodigious 4 year universities. Good lord I would do anything for just a few more hours a day or a time turner or Click remote. There just never seems to be *quite* enough time to get everything done that needs to get done properly, or else I'm sacrificing study time or vice versa. Let alone free time to do anything else. Man, I feel you. I spent the entire week coming home after long days of class, doing homework until 2 am, and then getting 5 hours of sleep before my 8 am's.

              " '<bos> My three friends and I (freshmen) have just signed a lease for next year. I am curious to know how you split the cost of groceries between your roommates? Do you buy your own bread, milk and meat? Do you make the person that eats the most pay the most? Obvioisly this is a trivial question but since most of you have experiences living with apartment living I want to know what works and what doesn\\'t work? Any advice beyond groceries is more than welcome. The top reply was: Buy your own food. Honestly the easiest way I see it is just to buy your own groceries. It is very hard to track exactly who eats what so just have your own separate stocks of food. Plus it\\'s hard to keep track of who likes what. You don\\'t want to be paying for expensive food you don\\'t eat that only your roommate wants. Stuff like salt, ketchup, etc. we share, because it hardly gets used. But everything else we just buy independently. Cook your own food too, is the corollary to that. Sure, it may be nice to think you\\'re going to cook up a great batch of steaks to share, but that could either create awkwardness in everyone trying to remain level on the food debt or give one friend what he thinks is a free food pass. College is amazing time to learn to cook. Take advantage of it. We buy our own \"major food\" and share a little of each others\\'. eg. condiments which we use in small quantities is shared. I might buy the chilli powder, my roommate would buy the pepper, the other would buy the cinnamon. Rule of the house is to replace what you use- so if I use 3 tomatoes or the juice that my roommate got, I\\'d replace them. It helps that I\\'m good friends with my roommates so we talk about stuff.  For things like milk (which you wouldn\\'t want 3 bottles of in the fridge), take turns in buying them. Buy your own groceries. Take turns buying paper towel and dish soap and the like. <eos> ',\n",

For those wanting to recycle, most grocery stores have plastic bag recycling stations near the entrance (I know I've seen them at Schnucks). Also, the Feed The Thing bins in Champaign [accept plastic bags]([url link] which in my experience is rare for municipal recycling programs. All garbage haulers in CU must pick up recycling as well as trash. You apartment building will have two bins - one for recycling and one for trash (non-recycle). You can have two bins in your apartment (or house) - place all glass, metal and plastic in the recycle bin and place its contents in your apartments recycle dumpster. The recycling is taking to a sorting location and sent off for re-use (we all hope!). <eos> \",\n",

Also contact Tenant Union. Have you documented when you contacted your landlord? Have you taken pictures of said leak, and provided them to landlord? Clear documentation is key. Document it. If you have clear documentation (enough to stand up in court), then you can hire someone to fix it after a month and take the cost out of your rent in Urbana. I cannot stress enough, however, that you need clear documentation that you asked for the repairs numerous times and you made it clear to your landlord that you needed it done - otherwise you will lose the court case if they bring you there and you will pay for all the repairs out of pocket. <eos> \",\n",

Send me a PM with your interests, I might be able to help.

              " '<bos> I was looking at the transfer handbook for a few majors, and it seems like every major *requires* an A in every class already taken related to the major. I have a 3.66 GPA now and Bs in all relevant coursework. Beyond that, for most majors I\\'ve looked at, they require some computer science courses which my community college does not offer. Specifically, the Mathematics and Computer Science major requires intro to computer science, data structures, and a 4.0 in math and CS classes. Has anyone had success at transferring from a community college without meeting all the requirements. I emailed admissions and someone over there said it was highly unlikely that I\\'d get in without meeting all the requirements.  The top reply was: This really depends on your desired major, but if it\\'s in the college of engineering, or business you\\'re probably not getting in with straight B\\'s in the relevant coursework.  Same goes for missing courses, how likely it is that you\\'ll be admitted depends on the major your applying for. You can take cs courses at a different community college [url link] In the link above, for \"Mathematics  Computer Science\", the footnote says \"The recommended GPA for the courses in the Calculus sequence is 3.00 (A=4.0)\", so getting a B in calc is fine. In fact, that\\'s what I did (got A\\'s on my CS 125 equivalent course and a B- in Calc 2, and got accepted into Math  CS).  I doubt you would get accepted as a transfer student if you don\\'t complete a single computer science course if you\\'re applying for math and cs tho. Thanks, I didn\\'t see the footnote before. However, it says in the first paragraph \"a minimum grade of A- is required on each computer science and mathematics course taken.\" After reading the footnote, maybe it means you need an A- for each course once you are admitted?  I think I\\'m going to take an online computers 101 course that teaches \"spreadsheets and word\\' that transferology says will transfer as cs101. I\\'d apply for mathematics which is listed in the liberal arts college. I guess I had forgot to mention in the post <eos> ',\n",

The top reply was: Note: you have to take both phys 142 and 143 at parkland to transfer both. 142 is a prerequisite for 143 but you can talk with an advisor or the department. Parkland student here, and I am currently taking PHYS 142 with carl Lorenz. In the summer PHYS 142 is probably taught by Omar Adawi, which I heard is a really tough professor. He usually teaches math, and he gives a ridiculously long homework, he grades harshly and his exams are always stressful. For PHYS 143, keiko will most likely teach. She is an easy grader, and her exams are easy too. HOWEVER, she is terrible at lecturing. I took mechanics with her and I hated my life, I read the book cover to cover to do well in the course, so if you are willing to do the work and teach yourself the material it will be an easy A. Th  I recommend you take phys 142 with Carl Lorenz, he knows his stuff well and knows how to teach, and has amazing lecture slides. But he only teaches in fall and spring. goodluck <eos> ',\n",
              " \"<bos> guys I need some advice, am not sure which major to pick I am in dgs atm. Adviser said if i take chem eng i need to get A's in like physics 212, chem 236/237, chbe 321 diff eq. I think that will be hard. If i take chemistry i only have to take physics 101/102, even though i took 211, chem 232,233, and some other classes not sure yet. What would you guys recommend i choose as my major. The top reply was: They're related in name but the two are very different majors. The upper div classes go in totally different directions. ChemE is an engineering discipline and as such, it is about design and problem solving at heart. You'd design systems involving reactors, coolers, heat exchangers, etc. and advanced math and chemistry knowledge would be used to pick the right components for these designs.  If that's not your jam, don't do it. You're not going to stop hating it after you've taken classes like ChBE 321/421/422 and the like, it would become your career. Granted, the job prospects are pretty vast, but unless you absolutely excel at what you do (and it seems like you're not confident you will), you're not going to pick and choose what you do with your degree. You might be stuck in process design, the one aspect of ChemE you ended up hating, while the top Chem student went into research. Choose the one you're more interested in. If you care about the material you'll put in the effort to get a good grade. Same reason physics is in engineering. And you don't need A's in all the core classes. I think core GPA for ChemE is like a 2.7 or thereabout. Also I've been told that LAS gets a lot of money from Chemistry so they fight really hard to keep it. I assume that this affects ChemE too. <eos> \",\n",

Is this guy still pedaling his wares to inebriated students on Green street? Does anyone else even know who I\\'m talking about when I say \"Hot Dog Guy?\" I\\'d love to purchase one of his chicago styles right about now. The top reply was: Yes, very much so. Had a night not too long ago over beer speaking to him about how many \"wieners he could slam\" in an hour. He also trashed talked everything trying to be Italian in town, and told me how to make beastly pasta. He also had chairs so you could sit and enjoy his wieners. It depends on who you are talking about (and how old you are.)  In the mid/late 90\\'s there was a hot dog guy that would hang out on Green. His name was Taki (sp?) and he was super Greek, and would dance and sing for all the drunk kids.  He opened a restaurant in 2001(?) called Mykonos at 4th  Green. They were open until 4am every day and had a variety of Greek food and 50 different burgers (I delivered for him for about 3 months.) Unfortunately he died around 2002. I\\'ve never seen a guy work so hard and sleep so little. He set up a (illegal) cot in the restaurant and would only go home 2 nights/week. the meanies weenies guy is a badass. My friend was drunk and lost his credit card, and canceled it. Around a month later he buys a weenie and the guy pulls out my friends credit card and hands it to him, saying he left it there last time. No idea how he recognized my friend and knew it was his card a month later, but a baller indeed. <eos> ',\n",

Summer 14 had fourteen courses and even offered 173 and 225. But it offered nine courses over summer 15. Finally, Seven courses over summer 16. I mean I have heard that CS courses are highly demanded, especially 125 173, in fall and spring semesters and tons of non-cs majors seek to take these courses. Department said it is doing its best to increase the capacity, but why are they not offering these courses over the summer? Will they continue with the pattern and offer even less amount of courses this summer?  The top reply was: MCS-DS program has summer courses with DSO in the section name. Source: in said program. Budget cuts are another root cause I suspect. Probably many more 9 month contracts these days. down vote? Happy to hear that this is wrong but if I am please tell us so. <eos> ',\n",

Can anyone who interned there tell me a bit about their experience and if the option to work there during the school year is an option? The top reply was: I worked at grainger during the school year and I enjoyed every second it. The intern group I worked with was very smart and fun so I looked forward to going to work everyday. The projects we did were also very cool especially if you are ECE since there was usually a big hardware component. However, that was last year and they are only looking for PHD or MS CS students now because they completely shifted their focus. I would look elsewhere but if you are still curious you can stop by them at the career fair. As for John Deere, I would not recommend it unless you really like programming since that is the majority of the work. In addition, their pay is nothing compared to CAT or Grainger. John Deere is also not doing so well right now since they laid off workers last semester. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make but I would not reocmmend it. Abinbev sounds really cool from what one of my friends told me but that is all I know. Hope this helps! AbbVie is master race, definitely work there! Is it hard to get a job at research park? Depends what you are going into. Most companies there favor people that can do CS work and caterpillar's recent downturn was mostly for non cs/ece people. In general, I'd say its much easier to get a job at research park than other companies since research park likes uiuc kids alot. Dow does a number of internships both during the school year and summer. I think it's internal support, but I'm not certain. They're upstairs from John Deere. Forcepoint also did internships last summer and is expecting to do so again this summer. It would be almost entirely coding and is located in the same building as John Deere and Dow. <eos> \",\n",

Is this still subject to change, could I still be dropped? The top reply was: Academic probation means you got a GPA between 1.0 and 2.0 last semester. Not a drop. This is, as you\\'ll find out in the beginning of the semester\\'s probation meeting, the \"last chance\" people often ask for when they get dropped. Coming from someone who was right where you were three years ago, go back and make this next one count. Don\\'t be afraid to reach out to advisors and your upcoming semester\\'s professors for help. Did your status previously say academic probation and was recently changed to college probation?

On pg 28 of this [document]([url link] Dean Cangellaris says he supports the idea as long as it does not impact time-to-degree for CoE students. Page 19 of the same document outlines how to accomplish this. I know within the CEE department that there are 6 hours of free electives out of the 128 required for a BS degree. So the additional requirement will reduce free elective hours to a minimum of 3 if a student doesn\\'t take a class fulfilling two requirements. I think this limits a student\\'s ability significantly to explore courses either outside of their degree program, or even delve further into their major at higher courses. <eos> ',\n",

Some guy pulled a muscle in his back and everyone was telling him to go to the emergency room / urgent care. As the only sane person tellling him to wait a day and go to McKinley, I got voted off the page. 217 333-1216 = UIPD 217 333-8911 = MetCAD non-emerg They both get answered regardless of anything, you might want to check your numbers OP. No, he's right. The last time I called the non-emergency number for a broken traffic light they patched me through to 911. That's... terrifying. (The lights and the non-response.) Honestly, I would keep trying. I don't want to do it because I didn't witness it. i tried calling the police department's non-emergency number but no one picked up after a while. And it appeared that the pedestrian lights and the traffic lights were out of sync <eos> \",\n",

It would make far more sense to let the user login one more time to reset their password instead of locking them out of their account. Is there any fix around this?  Update: this shit is really annoying that I can't login to Moodle b/c of this bs The top reply was: It sends emails every week when you have a month left. Maybe check your email once in a while You will need to contact the help desk. If you are on campus, go see them with your i-card and they will reset it for you. If you are off campus, call them and they will have you submit identification documents through an online form to reset your password. [url link] I got an email a couple weeks before mine expired warning me to get my ass in gear. Maybe sift through your email to see if there are instructions in there on what to do. Two-factor is slowly starting to roll out. Additionally, now that the new password system supports up to 127 character passwords, if you set a password that is longer than 16 characters, the 4 letter word restriction no longer applies. Passwords under 16 characters still need to avoid 4 letter words. If you allowed it to expire you have to see a password registrar to generate a password reset token to get back into the system. The easiest way is probably go to tech services help desk at DCL. <eos> \",\n",

So I am just wondering if anyone has any insight to this program, or how competitive it is getting into UIUC Agriculture Grad Schooling?? The top reply was: Any idea on the average GRE score that gets into the PSM? I don't really think I have the grades or the extra curriculars to get into the traditional masters program.. I assume you mean the Professional Science Masters program (PSM)? The PSM program is very new and is not really competitive to get into. What kind of job do you want after graduation? Pursue a traditional MS if you see yourself going into research, lab work, or a PhD program. You really need to have a strong network and focused goals to get the right job after the PSM. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: I think posting up things about our rights to privacy, to be protected from unreasonable search, etc aren't at all a problem or disrespectful to the guards. Also things about the efficency and the cost of the whole program. If anything, the guards are really just 'doing their jobs'. The outrage is more against the policies and procedures (and some specific guards). I hate to say this, but the guards at Willard are likely the best you're going to come across this season! They're actually helpful and patient. I know this sounds like hell froze over, but it's true in my limited experience. However, I do disagree with being subjected to ionizing radiation and unwarranted pat-downs/searches, so I understand and agree with the basic idea here. I'm just thinking some of the local officers who have always been courteous might be a bit frustrated to see the backlash the rest of the nation is.  Ps- I upvoted not downvoted- no idea where these silly downvotes come from! I agree. I was thinking about the unfortunate mass of people who can't afford to fly out of Willard. Chicago airports are probably going to be awful about it. Go YAL! I'm down Flying out of Willard is the BEST!

Second City is not exactly famous, but they're a good improv group and they're going to be at the Virginia Theater this weekend. Weird Al will be there on March 30. Nothing coming up at State Farm afaik. I've seen some good shows at Crackers in Indianapolis. Are you kidding? Second City’s arguably one of the more famous comedy groups. I would catch that if I were you, you might see the next Bill Murray or Amy Poehler If you're willing to go to Chicago then there are always big acts passing through, the only filter is your taste. I'd personally suggest trying out the Io theatre for some improv shows. Tickets are cheap, there's a bar, and you're going to see an original work performed for the first and last time in that night.

Tests are 75% of the grade but the tests were mostly easy.

My roommate does not want me playing video games in the dorm. I\\'d just need a place to charge, space for a mousepad, and a decent internet connection. The top reply was: That seems like the better option to me. I mean, that’s fine if he wants to cut out gaming and all. But with all due respect, that’s a “him” problem. His choices shouldn’t necessarily burden you with unnecessary (and incredibly inconvenient) accommodations.  I applaud you for making the effort to be considerate and all, but his lifestyle change doesn’t have to turn you into a nomadic gamer. That seems like an odd accommodation unless that part about disturbing others comes into play in the form of screaming and yelling. If you aren’t raging, what causes an issue? Tell your roommate that it\\'s his responsibility to ensure he stays away from games, not yours, and that it is not reasonable for him to prevent you from gaming in the comfort of your room. It\\'s as much your room as it is his. This is 100% his problem, not yours, and as such you are not at all obligated to compromise with him imo. edit: I hope you don\\'t misconstrue what I said as being disrespectful or rude. I\\'m all about respecting others/treating them how I want to be treated but the thing is by imposing this \"accommodation\" on you, he is in fact the one doing the disrespecting. The roommate\\'s in for a wake up call if he thinks it\\'s ok to just tell people not to do something because of a dumb reason like \"then he will want to also.\" I suggest OP learn to stand up to this roommate and stop letting him walk over them. eceb <eos> ',\n",

I\\'ve completed all of my honors requirements but have a 3.45 with a needed 3.5 gpa, so will I probably be dropped? The top reply was: From the LAS website:  \"If at the end of an academic year your Illinois cumulative GPA is between a 3.25 and a 3.49 AND you completed the additional honors requirements without any issues, you may be granted the opportunity to petition for a probationary semester. If a probationary semester is granted you will have one term to overcome the deficit in your GPA while keeping up with the additional honors requirements. If your GPA is not at a 3.50 or higher at the end of your probationary term, you will be lapse from the program.\" This is strongly college dependent. What college are you in?

              " '<bos> I took Calc 3 and Intro to Linear Algebra as a senior in high school. Both were one semester long and were dual credit courses - they counted for both high school math and cc credit (the class was a community college course taught on the hs campus). So both classes are on my CC transcript. Now, the community college is not on u.select, and I asked an advisor about using this credit to skip MATH 241. She said I had to \"bring in the CC transcript and class syllabus\" and that they\\'d look over it. I\\'m not really sure what this means.  Has anyone had a similar experience? I really would like to jump right into DiffEq if possible. If all else fails, I\\'ll probably just study and take the proficiency exam. The top reply was: It will probably take a semester to sort it out. Just sign up for Diff Eq anyway. They don\\'t enforce prerequisites for most classes. I took Math 286 last semester and the only thing we needed to know from Calc 3 was partial derivatives. I had to go through the same thing for Calc 3 credit. Basically you need a syllabus from the semester that you took the course, make sure to include the book used and the chapters used within it. Also include the teacher\\'s contact information and if you submit that along with your syllabus they will review it. Basically they check what chapters and stuff you covered compared to what they covered to see if it is similiar enough to give you credit for it. Beware though it can take a while, when I did it it took about an entire semester to finally get approval. I already sent the syllabus and form I wrote about in this comment: [url link] Do you know if they\\'ll get it? Or should I send another to your address? I am sure that they will send it on to the Course Articulation Unit - so just keep an eye out for an email from your freshman advisor. I just took 285 last term. I\\'m almost positive we used nothing from calc 3 in the class. Just integration and substitution. <eos> ',\n",

Dibs Switch to Computer Engineering. In all seriousness, I doubt most of the people on Reddit have a problem with getting *too much* sex, so the sympathy will be minimal. But, if I had to guess, it's at least partially a craving for human interaction, where it's hard to find intimacy on a more substantial level. Now, it seems you're an Engineering major, and I'm guessing a Sophomore. My experience with fellow Engineers has not exactly been that we are the most readily, intimately sociable of folks. Not only that, but you're quite possibly 6:1 or 10:1 guys to girls in your classes, so the friends that could be made are few and far between. You're at least decently far from home, and you've most likely just spent Summer separated from friends both new and old, so you're antsy for social contact in the same way that when you sit for too long you just have to move around. And, because men are the way that men are, that's an itch that's easy to scratch by getting drunk and having sex with guys you barely know, but scratching an itch doesn't make it go away. My suspicion is that there are no easy answers; not that I've tried the ones that have been suggested to me, anyhow. Maybe join an RSO, or try and find girlfriends through SWE or WECE or just making a study group with classmates. <eos> \",\n",

It was two men one white one black in ameren uniforms asking for my account information. The top reply was: I work at Ameren in Central Illinois and way to deter them is asking for immediate identification. We\\'re required to wear badges on-site at all times, so if they\\'re legit, they\\'ll have them. However, this is an old tactic scammers do to fool older or less aware customers, so know that legitimate Ameren workers would never ask for account info in person! They want to \"check to make sure you got the upgrade\", and then will claim you need to sign something to get it. The thing you sign gives you a new energy source, which still goes through Ameren as a provider (I\\'m not sure exactly how that works) -- in the short-term it looks like a good deal, but in the long-run the rates spike and/or there is a big cancellation fee, etc. The business itself might be \\'ethically questionable\\' but not illegal, but the way they get you to sign has got to be illegal. They claim they are with Ameren and want to see your Ameren bill, which probably has your name, address, and account information on it, and maybe SSN. They might sign you up without your knowledge with that info, and you won\\'t know it until you get a confirmation letter from Ameren. I\\'m guessing if you ignore the letter the switch goes through (I\\'ve only read about it) -- the paperwork the frauds give you encourages you to ignore that letter. In short: call the cops. I would hope it is illegal to impersonate a public utility worker. ....or just say \"No thank you\" and close the door. It\\'s really not necessary to engage everything that crosses your eyeline.

The top reply was: Take GEOL 107 for rock, it also counts as a tech elective for CpE. Not really, the vibe here is definitely indie/punk house show scene. A lot of that stuff is in Carbondale. Tbh CU seems to have everything except a tight metal scene for a semi-urban area.

Both GPA visualizations have been updated with the latest GPA data that UIUC has released, which includes last semester (Fall 2016). Links: - [Every Gen Ed at UIUC, by GPA]([url link] - [GPAs of Every Course at The University of Illinois]([url link] Enjoy! The top reply was: Is there a way to access the raw data? It's kind of frustrating trying to find a specific class in the midst of other closely-numbered classes. I like giving a lot of consideration to the average GPA when registering for a class.  Overall, a cool project. I love seeing these. Certainly! It's shared on the course website for CS 205 each semester we use the GPA data for visualizations, though as I transition out of teaching CS 205 it should be put somewhere more permanent. I'll put it all on one place and link it here as soon as it's done (by this weekend at the latest). Second this. Would love to see the raw data! If you want an operating systems class with some harder exams, I've got a few leads. Random observation: the average GPA for GWS101 its 2.89. Is it a hard course, or do they grade you based on how well you conform to the narrative? (this isn't a dig per say, I'm just curious) <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Yes, if you pop off the heat convector face plate on your radiator there is a black handled valve that controls the flow of steam to your room. You can adjust this to control how hot your room gets. I did this when I lived in ISR and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. IIRC no. Same thing would happen to me in PAR and ISR. Crack the window ? In FAR you can take off the top plate and there's a thing that you can turn to control the air flow. Or you always submit a request online to let someone comes and fix it... That's one of the great service you get when you're living dorms so use it. Ask for help: [url link] You really don't need air conditioning when you have the *outside* at 50ish degrees.  Also, I remember that they always turn on the heaters way too late in the year. If it's on now they're probably just testing the system for a bit. <eos> \",\n",

I stopped by and asked a police officer a couple hours ago. He said that their has been 35 robberies in a month and a half, and so they're doing a bit of a show of force to try and keep things safer. Seems pretty legit to me, actually. And the officer was very friendly. A strange man in an overcoat walks up to you and re-enacts each crime to you once per week.

Like average time per hw/to study per test/etc... Thank you for your insight! The top reply was: CS 374 if you are working in a decent group should be 10-15 hours per week including thinking of the solutions and writing up the solutions in LaTeX. It could vary if your group decides to divide and conquer. CS 225 is highly dependent on how comfortable you are with C++ and data structures. Including the lab and MP every week, it could prolly require commitment of 10 hours per week plus some more during weeks with difficult MPs such as MP3 etc I\\'m not sure I\\'d include 225 in the \"tough\" list; it is a great class, but is intended to be very accessible. The courses that I usually encourage my advisees to be careful about scheduling for are CS 241, CS 242 (now 126) and CS 374. While this is strictly true, it\\'s strongly advised to typeset responses; this takes only minimal effort using something like markdown/pandoc, or sharelatex, or Dropbox paper, and has a few benefits, not least that it\\'s much easier to check your work (and modify it) if it\\'s typeset. have fun rewriting your proofs in Ms word Meh if you have good handwriting and a cam scanner app it\\'s like 10x easier imo.

Just wondering if anyone has any advice about renting an apartment inside of a house... normally big houses that have been converted into 3-4 1 bedroom apartments. Anything to be wary of? Do you have to interact with the other people in the house, or is it really just like living in any other apartment? The top reply was: I've lived in a couple. A lot of the time they fuck up the heating when they carve a house up. Forced air heaters work by **pulling** air, not pushing it, and the cheap contractors they hire often don't think about the returns. I'd think twice about renting from one of these places that has a central forced air heating unit. Either electric baseboards, or a heater per apt. Make sure you have an electrical box/circuit breakers inside your unit. It sucks to trip a breaker, then find out the box is in a unit where the guy went on vacation. Don't rent an apt where they closed in a porch and turned it into a bedroom. It's going to be cold af in the winter. Most of the time they don't bother to insulate or heat these properly. That being said, I loved living in these places. They have a character and quirkiness that really appeals to me. Best of luck. I live in one now. I rarely interact with the people I live with. Probably only one washer/dryer in a shared space but other than that it's just an apartment. I've lived in a lot of those. I met my neighbors, unlike when I've lived in regular apartments, but I never felt any pressure to be friends with them. It's mostly just nice to have someone to grab your packages or let you in if you lock yourself out while doing laundry. The only real problem I ever faced was that one apartment is usually in charge of the heating/possible AC for the whole house. It could be too hot/cold and they could end up not being very flexible. If you can deal with that, I highly recommend it! Seconded on the character. I just can't get into basic apartments. They never feel like home. But I've never lived in one where the breaker has been in someone else's apartment. It's always been in the basement. So if you don't see one, make sure that's the case, OP. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: Did you mean to post pictures? Thats coming from a storm sewer drain pipe aka the drains in the street. Someone poured something into it and it washed out with the rain today.  Could be something as simple as one of the restaurants dumping a bunch of spoiled milk into the street or someone dumping some used paint thinner etc. The amount of oil,coolant and other stuff that cars leak onto the surface and gets washed into these drains is a much bigger deal. [The post OP is referring to]([url link] Snark it up if you like, dude, but this * Isn\\'t dumping and * Isn\\'t illegal This is planned and purposeful drainage after a storm. Sure, it sucks. Sure, it needs a fix. But showing up to Boneyard Creek Cleanup will have a lot more effect than copy/paste slactivism. This.

Glad to see I'm not alone. eh the way i see it, its not like /r/uiuc is so big that you need to separate all the sports talk. There is like 2 posts a week about sports, it just makes this subreddit more active if we include everything and that will only be a issue if it becomes 10000+ people in it. I kind of think that the reason there are only a couple of sports posts is because they don't get a lot of attention when they do happen and they just sort of feel out of place. I've noticed the same thing on /r/chicago. You'll see posts about the various teams there, but only after really big news. I think this is a great idea.

I was just wondering if anyone knows if the seating at the games is super strict or not. Thanks! The top reply was:  We both got the C section because we didn't know any better  I read this in the comments view mode and didn't at first realize that you were referring to a basketball game. Since the last two games have been a sellout, there is a good chance that a seat won't be available next to either of you. They don't check your ticket when you are sitting down in the upper sections, but you may have issues if you are sitting in someone else's seat and they show up. You might have better luck sitting up toward the top of the C section. I would think it be mostly students in Level C who want to sit together, so I don't see it being a big issue. Everyone will be trying to sit together If there aren't seats available, you can always ask the people next to you if they are willing to move. It never hurts to ask. Yeah probably.

(Statistics and Probability, Devore, 9th edition) Are assigned homework problems only available in the 9th edition of the book? I see the 8th edition is cheaper online. Alternatively, is the STAT 400 textbook available at the library(ies), so I could look up homework problems that way?

Which means there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima... This leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality? What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift? Was there a Cars 9/11? Were the planes hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized? I could go on  Was there a Cars 9/11 There are multiple 911s, though some people (*cough* Clarksoooon! *cough*) call them Beetles.

Not sure I believe it, six years science with AP chem and Bio in HS, 31 ACT, I think GPA was culprit(couple C's but also highly involved student). Chance to go elsewhere with Bio major but like UIUC. Looking for experiences getting into something you want that is non engineering/CS from DGS and worried will be funneled into a non science degree..... The top reply was:  Transfer to biology (either Integrative Biology or MCB) is pretty easy. You will need a C or better in IB 150, MCB 150, and CHEM I and II. [url link]  The advice to stay away from DGS is really only for people who want a spot in CS or engineering. Transferring to biology after a few semesters in DGS shouldn't be difficult. [url link] I transferred from DGS to IB. Was super easy. Like you said, you'll take IB 150, MCB 150, and Chem 102 + 104 your freshman year. As long as you pass them, and do fine in the rest of your classes so that your GPA isn't shit, the transfer will be easy. Don't even need to write a paragraph. You just need to meet and get approval from an adviser from whichever biology program you choose.  Super straightforward and you'll be taking the same classes as the rest of the students already in the program, so you won't fall behind. Like I mentioned, I transferred in from DGS and I even graduated early. Do try and take some non-biology related classes your freshman year too though. You may believe you want to study biology now, but if you are going to be in DGS anyway, might as well explore your options at the same time as well. Feel free to message me if you have any additional questions about transferring or the biology program. If the other schools are R1, you can consider them seriously for bio. But if you're set on UIUC, getting into IB/MCB should not be difficult if you keep your grades up. Thanks! I just wanted to get some opinions on here, it is a big decision to me as I do know what I want to major in. I do appreciate all the replies. You'll get into bio, what are you not believing? Nobody is lying to you. You meet the requirements and you're in. <eos> \",\n",

However, the site [url link] asks for either a Illinois Driver's License Number or a Illinois State Identification Number, and I don´t have any of those. If anyone knows if something could be done, please, let me know. Thanks!  The top reply was: If you don't have a driver's license or State ID, you need to mail a paper return to them. Regardless of whether you actually owe any tax or not, you need to file an IL-1040, *if you had any income last year*. I believe for international students, you also need to attach a copy of your federal 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ as well, in addition to a copy of your W-2 and/or 1042-S etc. Getting a state ID is pretty straightforward. It'll take you less than an hour, and will be totally worth it.  [url link] Beware, I owed the state of illinois like $10 every year for the past forever... for whatever reason, they don't take enough out of my paychecks. But, yeah, you can send a paper copy. The forms and instruction can be obtained online, or if you don't want to pay for printing, public libraries stock tax forms try turbotax free edition, it may or may not allow you to file conveniently online. at the worst, it will guide you towards filing properly. File on paper and as a non-resident. Only residents would have an Illinois driver's license anyway, so your issue isn't just limited to international students. <eos> \",\n",

For example, I've heard of brazilian internationals getting together sometimes, have heard of Australians and british students having get togethers. I was wondering how I could go about finding people who are francophones. I miss speaking my mother tongue and it would be great to connect with people who grew up with the same culture I grew up with, which I think would be really cool to have in a place like champaign. While I know this sub isn't to keen on more international-domestic segregation, all my friends are americans and it would be nice to meet other french people/francophones. If any of you are francophones let me know if we could get together, it could be fun. Or if you know how I could find out about stuff like this.  The top reply was: Not a Francophone myself but you might try checking the bulletin boards in the Foreign Language building or asking someone in the French department over there. Often language programs try to hook learners up with regular speakers, so they might know of some event like that, at which point you might meet some other regular speakers there and get more info. Surely there must be a French society? (Or whichever country you're from, if that's not your thing.) So... there's a British society? Not saying I want to go bcs chances are we'd have nothing in common, but... I don't actually know anyone else from my country here. So could be interesting. Also whatever this subreddit says about your culture is totally irrelevant to your experience, because they haven't had it. <eos> \",\n",

Anything other than failing (F) in most classes works! (For CS/ECE, double check if you're in a different major!) Ask your advisor to be sure. I know in some departments, you need at least a C to pass a class in your required major. In others, it's a D. Not cs or ece. How can I change for my major? It just lists required gpa stuff but specific class grades. Thanks for the answer Your college office can also answer that question if your advisor isn't getting back to you. It's the college offices that do the final check to see that you're all good to graduate. <eos> \",\n",

He said Champaign not Rantoul. The Art Theatre (best movie theatre), Mike n Mollys and the Highdive (live music), Jupiter's (half price pizza and billiards on Tuesdays), Farren's (delicious burgers), Seven Saints (good food for a bar), 301 Mongolia (like Flat Top, but better), and Destihl. Also, go to Golden Harbor. It's not quite in downtown Champaign, but it's arguably the best Taiwanese/Chinese food place in town. You've got a lot more balls than me lol You can enter a bar if you are under 21 and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

I think people get caught up in the pitch forks and forget to see that the people they are insulting at their professors and people too.

Whether you \\'feel\\' safe or not really does not matter when looking at this issue. That feeling is purely subjective. Someone who is blissfully unaware of the danger around him may also \"never feel unsafe\". Yet the danger will remain. When I say I have seen crime get worse, I am referring to a combination of the crime alerts and the police blotter. When I was a freshman and sophomore, crime alerts, and particularly violent ones (robbery at gunpoint), were extremely rare. However, in the last two years, they have become far more prevalent. The area northeast of County Market and the area around First and Daniel are both particularly bad in terms of crime alert density. <eos> ',\n",

Anyone can join Anyone is accepted, cs major or not. You can just show up to any sig meetings or just chill in the siebel office. You contribute to any sigs project as much as you want/can, there's no commitments. If you see a SIG doing something you think is cool just ask to join in. I can pretty much guarantee you that they'd love any help or new members that they can get. Don't worry about not being up to the same skill level as some of the people around the office, the best way to learn is by diving in. We're friendly, I swear! ACM is probably one of the friendliest places on campus to be.

(assuming they are in a state where recreational marijuana is legal) Never smoked one, ever... when I was in college, I didn\\'t smoke it because I had a part time job as a teaching assistant at a local high school... since it was a public high school, every employee had to take a drug test every 3 or 6 months.

The top reply was:  Never smoked one, ever... lol you never smoke one marijuana? I believe, but do not know for sure, that there is a section of the student code that governs this. From section 1-305: Policy on Drugs from the \\'16-\\'17 book: The illegal possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia is prohibited. While the use of medical marijuana has been legalized in the state of Illinois, the possession or use of prescribed medical marijuana is prohibited on campus property. The first sentence suggests that any illicit drug use is \\'prohibited.\\' Since marijuana is still illegal under federal law, my guess is that the answer to \\'Are UIUC graduate/teaching/research assistants allowed to smoke legal marijuana?\\' strictly speaking is \\'no.\\' That said, literally nobody is going to care. sadly, no...  prohibited **on campus property**. Looks to be a yes, technically. NAL obviously, but there\\'s nothing legally stopping OP from going to Colie and smoked recreationally while there, or even medicinally in-state but off-campus (?). For the purpose of Student Discipline, the University considers something \"illegal\" if it violates: (1) the local law where you are, (2) Illinois law - regardless of where you are, or (3) federal law - regardless of where you are. So yes, the University could take action against a grad student - as a student or as an employee - for smoking marijuana in a state or country that does not prohibit it. This would all be predicated on the student somehow gaining the University\\'s attention, and the University wanting to take action against them. <eos> ',\n",

The top reply was: I am sure this question has been asked before. Search the history. Beaumont is good, I've used them for years. KCM Autocare in Urbana is very good, depends on what you need done. Red's Muffler for exhaust work, KCM for general Automotive work, and Crawfords for transmission work. That's where I go when I can't do the work myself. They are all family owned and are big on doing things right. Can attest to KCM being very good and very reasonably priced. One of the most trustworthy mechanics is yourself! Not sure if your issue is a check engine light in which case this advice might be useful...Anyways, if your car is 1996 or newer, I would recommend that you go to Autozone. The one in my town does a free check where a guy just plugs a device into the car, which spits out a (OBD II) code telling you what might be wrong with your car. It's also free here. You can get a printout of the possible problems and buy the parts from Autozone or Amazon. The hard part is replacing the part though. I would recommend that you do a Google search of your car make, model, and part. Find a Youtube vid, go to the library and get a repair manual, and visit CarTalk forums.  If you feel like it's going to be something way over your head, visit the places the other nice people here suggested. I've saved at least a thousand dollars fixing my car over the summer.

The top reply was: I graduated last year and was premed all the way through but never applied. After I graduated, I learned how to program and the ins and outs of web development. I recently accepted a position as a software engineer at a pretty major tech company a couple days ago :) Not really the same thing, but I was originally a premed psych major and wanted to go into Psychiatry. Ended up dropping premed at the beginning of my sophomore year and decided to take an industrial-organizational route in psych hoping to find a job in human resources. Graduated in '13. Worked in lab and pharmacy for some time. I'm currently at a high placement special masters program so I will be going to med school, but I'll be 26. If you want it, you'll get there. Absolutely. I'm much more interested in psychology than medical studies, psychiatry seemed like a good option because it was something I was interested in at the time and the pay is usually very good, but once I found out about IO psych I realized I had very little desire to be on the premed track and decided to switch Are you happy with your decision so far? <eos> \",\n",

I'm taking MATH 461 next semester and, considering how big of a leap it might be, I'm wondering what kind of pre-studying I can do for the class during break. Thanks in advance! The top reply was: If you have Math 461 with Kirkpatrick, you will do just fine. I haven't heard as great of things about some of the other professors. Hey, I am in the same boat. I have not taken any proof based mathematics. Msg me if you ever need a study partner or anything I don't know if this class warrants too much preparation over break. It sounds like you have enough math background to do well. The first midterm pretty much focuses on counting (think how many ways to shuffle a deck of card, probability of selecting an ace and a queen on a draw of 5 cards, etc).  If you want to self study, Kirkpatrick's [website] ([url link] has class notes.  I'd recommend STAT 400 over MATH 461 because it tends to cover more material and generally has better instructors making the class less difficult.  Lastly, neither class used R when I took them. You'll use it more in STAT 420/425 Thanks; I was just a little worried because I know the class covers proofs and I haven't taken MATH 347 yet... Unfortunately I wasn't able to fit STAT 400 into my schedule :/ fuckin' do stronglifts 5x5. <eos> \",\n",

Now I find it hard to get up in the morning.  Help.  The top reply was: Last fall (at which point I also had a lack of motivation and felt like giving up) my grandma had two strokes, and every time I went home to visit her in the hospital her nurses would tell me she would talk nonstop about how proud she was of her grandson who was studying to be a “space engineer.” It really helped me see that she and the rest of my family are proud of me for getting to this point, and I can’t disappoint them by giving up or fucking up my studies. My GPA isn’t great but is improving, and I’m unlikely to get an internship, but I know they don’t care about that and want to see me keep going. Every time you think about not finishing an assignment or not studying for an exam, try to think about the people that believe in you and are proud of you. Use that as motivation! And most importantly, if nothing else works, remember how much fucking money you have invested in your education so far and use that as the fire under your ass.

The Business Career fair is coming up soon and I am not sure which name to put on my resume and use to introduce myself as. For things like my resume, LinkedIn, Facebook, Handshake, emails and applying for internships, should I be using my preferred name or my legal name?

When it comes time to fill out forms, or when you meet other professionals who only know you by said forms, it will create a moment of minor awkwardness where you explain your actual name - but it won\\'t actually negatively impact you, your prospects, or your professional life at all. Just be prepared for that \"Oh, hi Joe.\" \"Actually, I go by Mark.\"  \"Oh. Okay.

If you\\'re really worried, the most common ways I\\'ve seen are: - `LegalFirst LegalLast (PreferredFirst)` - `LegalFirst \"PreferredFirst\" LegalLast` I use my \"Preferred\" name all the time, since my legal name brakes Computer Input fields all the time (more then 10 characters and a - in there).

Avoid taking it if Arvin-Rad is the professor unless you're comfortable with stats material and R. Arvin-Rad is not an effective teacher and rambles a lot and none of the exams/homework/lecture slides are his own.Thankfully the class material isn't too challenging especially if you have a stats background (t-tests, F-tests, Normal distribution stuff, etc). Have some familiarity with R so that you don't have to learn the language on the go. Homework is a 2-hour assignment roughly every other week, so it's a pretty balanced courseload. Yeah, I took it with Hong in Spring 2015. It was dull as fuck and the language we learn (STATA) isn't even particularly useful in industry. On the other hand it was curved ridiculously. On the first midterm I got a 60%, which translated to a B+. As a stats major, it was a essentially a blow off 400 level class. Probably not that useful overall to anyone Phyllis Wise <eos> \",\n",

I was hoping to take SE 310 whose prerequisites include 212 and 251 the following spring (spring 2019) but it is only offered in the fall. So I will either have to take 310 with 212 and 251 or 211 with 212 and 251 or graduate late. What should I do?? SE students help! The top reply was: You need the basics of 211 to take 251. I do not recommend trying to take them concurrently. It is very common to take 212 and 251 together though. \"There is a will, there is a way\" seriously no. The entire idea of deformation in solid bodies is pretty much built on static mechanics and internal forces. I do not know if mechse enforce prerequisites (which is another question). I mean you can always try but make sure you drop before things explode out of control. Hi I\\'m in SE and it is very unfortunate that all our classes are spring or fall only. Here\\'s what I would recommend: take 212 and 251 in the summer if you can. 310 definitely uses 251 concepts, so it would be helpful to get 251 done first, and 251 uses 211 concepts. So, take 211 in spring and try to get at least 251 during the summer. 212 you could take concurrently with 310 imo, but if you could also knock out 212 during the summer, that would be perfect. What if I absolutely have to? Is there a way I can keep up with 251? SE 310 is fall only unfortunately <eos> ',\n",

I've talked to others as far as 6th and Springfield who hear it also, so does anyone know what the reason is for it? The top reply was: 1st and john is northwest part of campus.... I live at 2nd and daniel and hear the powerplant noise at a fair intensity when its going off. That's actually the campus cloud factory. It comes from the power plant with the two smokestacks. I dont know what it is. That was a sound from the southwest part of campus though. I should mention the noise usually seems to come on in the late afternoon, and lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours. <eos> \",\n",

I know there are many opportunities, but which are the most helpful? I am also signed up for TE 250. Thoughts? Also, any other TE class recommendations? Thanks! The top reply was: Check out iventure.illinois.edu Classes are OK, but you should check out the [TEC center]([url link] where you can meet a lot of like-minded people. Personally, I'm not much into it, but I've enjoyed their pitching sessions that they hold once or twice a semester. Apparently business majors don't know and are not allowed to learn how to code... XD Come on, you think I would really say I have a technical background if I only took CS 105?!?! Also you can check out EnterpriseWorks and Research Park: [url link] . You can meet with their Entrepreneurs in Residence to get ideas maybe. You don't have an engineering technical background, you are a business major. Just because you take CS105 doesn't mean you know how to code! Go back to your CC! <eos> \",\n",

I was able to get an idea of the stats PhD makeup from asking a TA, but I was more curious about CS and ECE. Was wondering if it's online anywhere or if anybody knew.  The top reply was: Sometimes you can find a list of current grad students for a program, and scan down through their entries to see where they went for undergrad or previous grad / professional degrees. That's the only place where I've seen this kind of info. I've never seen it in statistical form, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You should call the department and just ask. They'll tell you if they publish that info or not. I know [url link] has a lot of stats about enrollment but I couldn't find anything regarding your specific question but maybe you will have better luck on the page. I doubt the cs department has such information. The sample is too small, and anyway which undergrad program one come from is overshadowed by one's recommendations letters. There are lists trying to identify the better schools, naturally. gradschoolshopper.com The overall sample is large enough, but when restricted to a specific school it is dramatically smaller and statistically meaningless... <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> When applying to graduate school, I submitted my academic history, which has letter grades of transfer courses that were accepted by UIUC. However, on the DARS report, the grades for these transfer courses are not listed, it simply shows hours earned. Does anyone know if the OFFICIAL transcript has LETTER grades for transferred credits as opposed to just credits earned? If the transcript does not show letter grades, will graduate schools care if I don't send an official transcript from the other school? Its only three courses... If not, is there a way to request an official transcript WITH the transferred letter grades? I just really don't want to go through the hassle/expense of ordering an extra round of official transcripts... The top reply was: They showed up on mine. I still needed official transcripts from the other place, though.  E: I did transfer in-state, though. This could make a difference, as there is some sort of agreement between Illinois colleges. No, it shows the GPA of transfer courses and the number of transfer credits but the titles of the courses and the letter grades are not shown on the official transcript. <eos> \",\n",

Anyone know if I can just go to club team practices for fun, run around throw the ball around, learn the game etc? The top reply was: [this has their practice info and other stuff]([url link] I played for one spring semester a couple years ago. It was fun, but they are not really patient with rookies. They kind of make you do the scrimmages with them and yell at you when you do something wrong instead of correcting your behavior. It's a poor instructional strategy, but they are rugby players. Socially they CAN be fun. They are pretty mean to rooks but they will buy you a drink. All you have to do is chug it. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try for a couple weeks. I liked it.

The top reply was: I got a 41 I wanna die I don't what to do anymore I'm already having a panic attack for the final and its 3 weeks away OP, don't panic. What have you been getting on worksheets, quizzes, and Webassign? Those points help a lot. Got a 85 average on quizzes and like 100s on web assigns and worksheets i calculated my raw grade right now to be like a 70 which is still so far away from a B Just wondering...this won't help transfer chances, but does a D for this course suffice in terms of passing it? I heard the curve from last semester was around 5 - 7%, so there's always a chance. <eos> \",\n",

Not sure if I can get a permit for those 3 weeks or if there's a way I could park somewhere. The top reply was: You can park on the street in a part of Urbana northeast of Green and Lincoln for free up to 72 hours, then you have to move the car. If you don't mind moving it every three days, that should work. I think there might be a similar arrangement somewhere west of Neil, but I'm not sure. Also if you call parking you can get a permit for a lot on campus like E14. Where are you located on campus? I'm sure you could find cheaper, but the university does have 1 month permits for 110 [Link]([url link] You could park it in a storage unit for $50 bucks for the month if you dont plan on using it at all. Cheapest and safest route.  Edit: Not cheapest but still cheaper than $100 for E14 There is a parking lot that is owned by the First Presbyterian Church of Urbana. The parking lot is on the corner of Green and Orchard. The church does not mind if people park in the lot during the week but on Sunday early morning, you have to move your car. First offense: they'll give you a note on your windshield and write down your license plate. Second offense: they'll tow your car. It's a nice place to park since you can ride several buses back to campus from Green and Orchard. <eos> \",\n",

Anybody ever took 203 without 202? How hard is it ? Thanks ! The top reply was: I have not took 203 without 202, but I have taken both. The 202 professor is garbage and needlessly difficult. However, you go through the fundamentals before 203 which is known to be difficult for students. If you understand Alpha, betas, T-tests, P-values, variance, and such you'll probably be okay for beginning 203.  I struggle with statistics but I recognized I needed to go to TA hours and actually study outside of class until the concepts clicked. Put some effort in because Aplia - the program used - is a bitch and have made some people retake the course. Econ 202 is one of the most hated classes at UIUC. I've never heard a favorable review of that professor.  203 will be tough anyway you slice it, but an A is very manageable (lot of resources provided). Took 203 after just Ap stats. It was manageable though the class itself is on the harder side. I don't know that 202 will help you too much as my friends who took 202 found it relatively hard too. I would just go for 203. I did this. Def do not need to take 202. You will remember what you need to for 203. Just go to class and take all the practice tests and you will be fine. <eos> \",\n",

Nothing wrong with getting Kammered off dollar drinks, it'll take your mind off the smell. This happened right near the north path entrance to Illini Grove. My bike pedal fell off and in the resulting crash I bent my wheel beyond repair along with the front bit. It was an old Schwinn from the 80s at the latest, and in a fit of painrage I smote its ruin upon the lake's surface. Except the lake was frozen. It was January, after all.  So I came back the next morning, still limping and bruised, and saw the shape of my bike in thin ice, as if the lake had thawed enough to admit my evolved velocipede to its watery grave and then ice returned as if the bike had never been there at all. I have a photo somewhere of the shape of my tire in the ice. It still makes me laugh. *sniff* <eos> \",\n",

Is it social or service? transferring next year and know nothing about it. not wanting to go through the rush process, is there any informal recruitment in the fall or just spring? also, heard they may be more likely to give bids to juniors or seniors because they are new back on campus? The top reply was: they're a social house. If you're not even willing to rush, I'm not sure the sorority thing is for you. It's alot of that kinda stuff from my impression I get from friends. &lt;-- but coming from a guy, so maybe my opinion on it isn't valid. Agreed, I wouldn't pursue sororities if you're just looking at one house or aren't willing to go through the rushing process. It's best to go in with an open mind and see all your options before making a decision. But to answer your question, Phi Sigma Sigma is the newest sorority on campus. It's a social sorority, but service Greek organizations do exist. Fall is extremely formal, spring is usually more relaxed with smaller pledge classes. I'd like to say they would be, however they're extremely large at the moment and may focus on getting freshmen and sophomores to trend more toward the standard structure of being in a house for all 4 years. A lot of houses have informal recruitment after formal in fall, and definitely spring. Phi sigs may be more likely too, but they all can allow juniors in but they are hesitant too. <eos> \",\n",

Emphasis given to hip hop\\'s relation to urban spaces deeply impacted by state surveillance, cuts in social welfare programs, immigration, and the global restructuring of capital. Also considers the viability of a \"politics of hip hop\" in the wake of the music\\'s rising value as a global commodity and analyzes hip hop as a transnational site in which gendered and sexual identities are created, contested, and rearticulated. from the course explorer LLS 265 What class is this? I took it during the Spring 2015 semester, and it was taught by Cocoya at the time. I think the professor was intending on restructuring the class to be a little less project focused based on feedback, so it\\'s likely different now than my experience. It was an easy course, but I also looked forward to attending each class. The professor is really laidback and cool. Workload was pretty minimal with a few 1 page essays (I think every 2 weeks), and a final group project which wasn\\'t bad since we chose our own projects. I learned a lot about the origins of hip hop, what hip hop is, and the relationship between hip hop and social movements. Class discussion was highly encouraged, and I left every class with some new music to listen to and a strong appreciation for pre-2000\\'s hip hop. <eos> ',\n",

Our next game will be coming up very soon (re: next couple of weeks). We have some final admin things we have to take care of, but you should see us advertising on the Quad pretty soon. From there, we'll have some info meetings and then the game will start! If you have any questions, feel free to send an email to illinoishvz@gmail.com. Tell me what that is? Sounds hilarious. It's a week long game of tag/capture the flag that's played where ever you are on campus. Zombies tag humans to turn them. Humans defend themselves with rolled up socks (uiuc banned nerf guns). You wear arm bands from your team. It starts off with one zombie and by the end whoever humans have survive win. Plus there's ctf style missions you get through email.

The top reply was: I was very close to doing the University College of London ECE study abroad thing. I didn't end up doing it and now I regret it terribly. Sorry I can't actually answer your question though. Doing in the spring! so I guess I could let you know then? I had a friend in CS who did it as a sophomore and he enjoyed his time abroad. The worst thing was dealing with the College of Engineering because they can be nit picky about the courses you take but if you are committed it can be done. Studying abroad really is a valuable experience, I would highly recommend it. :( I'm in ECE and spent last spring semester studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark! While I personally am EE, there was one CompE and one CS student who were also there with me. We all had great experiences and even got to take classes we couldn't take here at UIUC. I would definitely recommend study abroad! Let me know if you would like some more info. <eos> \",\n",

How does Software Engineering II compare to Software Engineering I? The top reply was: dont go into it expecting software engineering 1 because its software engineering 2 and not software engineering 1 which is different than software software engineering 2 um... no ...u ...dont... make... sense... *rolls eyes*... Software Engineering II is quite a bit more freeform than 427 since you can pick and design your own project (at least when I was taking it). I personally liked it more than 427 but still felt like it was a bit of a slow class. It really depends on the team you\\'re with and if you\\'re personally invested in the chosen project or not. Expect a bit of a higher workload but more interesting overall than 427. fk riboflavins u right Well the best way to explain this is to contrast this to 427. In 427, you learned about some of the nitty-gritty and some programming in the real world. If it is of a similar class that I took, you had to practice by using Agile-Extreme Programming. Implementations of Agile are fairly common in software companies. Additionally, you had to modify something that was already in progress. In 429, you will get to \"start a business\" from the very beginning. In this class, you start a project from nothing or almost nothing. It is also up to you to decide on a collaboration process. This process still needs to be documented (it is not simply whoever works on whatever, or let\\'s wait til the last week to start work). Additionally, the advanced composition... is really BS and other than initially writing the essay, is just you revising the essay according to some pieces of advice... oh and if you fail to do so, you automatically get an F in the entire course regardless of your progress in the \"428\" portion. (P.S. This isn\\'t hard at all for most, I am just bitter that I got the one TA that was actually extremely strict and harsh with grading). <eos> ',\n",

Thanks! The top reply was: Congratulations! Everything you want to see is likely open. People from NY are unlikely to be impressed by Central Illinois. Yes. The best time to re-orient yourself is when the place is park like. Later when you return you will know of many places others will be too busy to discover. As a grad student you will in some ways be as much town as gown. So visit and find out where you want to live in the community, where you want to recreate and where to relax. This will likely be places where there are few undergrads.  Visit both down towns, both city libraries (your wife may really use those a lot), visit the arboretum, Japan House, tour Krannert Center for the Performing Arts are learn about the opening night party and the Ellnora Guitar Festival in September - get a schedule and make plans to see world class performers for 10 bucks a seat, walk through the buildings on the quad and poke your nose into class rooms and lecture halls, visit the Natural History Building as it just opened after almost 5 years of rehab, Lincoln Hall was recently completely remodeled, Krannert Art Museum may be closed for summer remodeling, go to ARC and CRCE (campus rec buildings) to make plans for exercise/swimming/etc, rent bikes and ride around perhaps - basically treat the campus and nearby towns as a vacation and look at things as you would in a vacation destination site. I think someone from NY would be amazed by how much $10 will get you at a bar around here. Just go to the Morrow Plots, instant love As a grad student, you might also enjoy exploring our off-campus downtown areas and see what life is like for young adults, which isn't affected by summer at all.

The top reply was: The job opening announcement is really poorly placed... Wow. My absolute favorite professor at Illinois. His Japanese theatre class inspired me like no other class ever has during my years as a student. My condolences to his friends and family. Thanks for sharing. I took his EALC 250 class years ago, and that inspired me to study Japanese, and ultimately study abroad in Japan later.  Great lecturer and teacher who will surely be missed. <eos> ',\n",

If you do not remove them, in a week or two they are going to start cutting off the locks and taking away the bikes.  I think they do this every month as well. And certainly the final purge is before school starts up again.  The top reply was: I believe the bikes get taken by the police and are eventually given away for free. ([url link] Who takes them? I think I may have lost a bike this way. Is it in a yard somewhere I can go and pick up my bike? thanks for this! Yep, so basically do not wait from them to take your bike, especially if you never registered it. any clue when the next one is or where we can find out? theres so many orange tagged bikes, some great bikes too. It's a shame people just leave them behind, but I def want one for free <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: That is not long at all. An interview is a massive deal for the applicant but it is often just one of many tasks being managed by the staff one speaks to.  How large was the company? Internship or full time work? I agree it’s not unreasonable to not hear back yet. Maybe they spread out their interviews a bit. In the future, be sure to ask about next steps/when you should expect to hear back. It shows you’re really interested in working for them. Do you have contact email there? If you don't hear anything by Monday or Tuesday next week you can drop them a line saying that you will be on Spring Break soon and so you are checking in to see if they need any additional information from you prior to Break. And thank them (again presumably) for the opportunity to interview. I just heard back from an engineering career fair company today. Edit: which was a month ago. Meaning, don't sweat 6 days. Seriously, how else could you read this? I also think it's perfectly acceptable to ask if they know when they might have a decision by. <eos> \",\n",

Do not do it without permission. Whether or not it is legal, if I were teaching that class, I would be *absolutely furious* with whomever posted the video and would use any avenue I had available to find the student responsible. So, do with that info what you will. Okay, my bad. I was assuming because you were speaking about legalities, you were referring to whether it was okay to do it without both parties' permission.  There may be copyright stuff the University has a say in; I do not know. But if the instructor grants permission, I assume she/he has some knowledge of whether that's allowed and can actually grant the permission, although I'm unclear what you mean by 'monetizing.' If it's on youtube, you get ad money anyway, right? Unless you're talking about vimeo or some other site. you would need to get their consent beforehand, both to record and to post. Leaving aside legality, it is a violation of University policy (i.e. copyright protections) and would result in a student discipline proceeding of some kind if you didn't get consent from the instructor and notify your classmates. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: [url link] Yup, just walked in to the Union and Googled some info on a business card some guy gave me The logo on the website looked familiar, so I went to \\'Contact Us\\' #**About Vector Marketing**  NOPE Also just think with some common sense. It has to be too good to be true if you get paid $17/hr with no experience. I mean, a buddy of mine made fairly decent money doing it even with me trying to convince him it was a pyramid scheme.

Black Dog will change your life. A lot of people are talking about Black Dog, and as great as it is, there are many places you can go to have the \"U of I experience\". As much as I LOVE Black Dog, I would feel my favorite place to go (which is also located in the center of all the big undergrad bars in Champaign) would be Murphy\\'s. It is a good combination of a college bar and the kind of bar I would go to now (3 years since I\\'ve graduated).  Best food? Probably Black Dog. Best place for an authentic U of I lunch? Murphy\\'s in my opinion. Hope whatever you choose you enjoy! The restaurant I most associate with undergrad is [Maize]([url link] Another authentic option is [Cravings]([url link] which continues to have a strong campus following despite repeatedly being shut down by the health department. <eos> ',\n",

              " '<bos> I feel like other schools get a couple weeks before school starts, whereas mine have always started the thursday or friday before our first day of school. Any reason for this? The top reply was: Because, at least at Illinois, most agencies are sitting pretty. They know housing is a HUGE demand, and there\\'s not much competition. Because of this, they are able to jack up prices, create a sense of urgency towards signing, and offer nothing more than the absolute minimum required. So, why don\\'t they be nice and let us move in before the last possible moment? The reason simply is \"because they don\\'t have to\". Advantage property does much more than the minimum required, and I highly recommend them to all. Mine started on the same day at you. I can choose the option to not clean the apartment to move in early. <eos> ',\n",

This is a common mistake and leads to a lot of good guys posting on here that they did amazing in class (3.8 GPA or higher) and still couldn't make it into CS/ENG.

We'll be hearing from advocates, reporters and lawyers. We're collecting questions from people in Illinois on this subject. What questions do you have? Has this recent news motivated you to take action in some way? Let us know and we'll bring it up on the show tomorrow. If we use your question or comment, we'll be sure to update you once the interview airs. The show is on the radio on AM 580, and streaming online at [url link] - we'll also post the audio online that afternoon. The top reply was: Yeah I have a question: why is Trump such a fucking dipshit? Are any steps being taken to prevent kidnappings and verify that claimed parents are real parents?

I believe MechE's have either the option of taking 214 and 213 or Chem 2. MatSE majors only take 214 I would guess that majors that have an intensive thermodynamic class later on in the curriculum get to skip PHYS213 Cs majors now only need physics 211 and 212. And Tennisball. Tennisball is always required. btw does anyone feel like 213 is way easier than 214? <eos> \",\n",

I have no idea, I commented on a thread that got made on here when he first announced it expressing my interest in being a part of something like that, but it got downvoted for some reason. I haven't seen or heard anything since, which is too bad because I was going to buy one regardless but they sold out before I could.

Which one do you think is the toughest and is there a common consensus on this in the math department? The top reply was: Bruh... If you actually try, Calc 3 (MATH 241) isn't that hard. Lmao no I haven't taken it, but I've heard honors analysis is harder than honors algebra. Neither is close to math 55 level. Taking 347H with Kevin Ford though... I kid, but that class was still a nightmare. Theres nothing like Math 55 at UIUC.  In its pre-2007 incarnation, Math 55 was basically a senior/graduate level math class for mathematically advanced freshman (with different topics depending on the instructor and year).  The current incarnation is a harder than normal (faster paced, more abstract) linear+abstract algebra and real+complex analysis course (basically 4 semesters of material in 2 semesters). The material is in between the undergrad and grad versions of these courses at UIUC. <eos> \",\n",

[url link] The top reply was: Or just kick them out because exactly 0 legitimate power companies have door-to-door salesman. Even if they do have their paperwork, they can still use the shady tactics which result in a jacked-up price. This. Just say \"No thank you\" and close the door. You don\\'t have to \"prove them wrong\" or trick them into admitting it\\'s a scam. Just don\\'t engage in the first place. And really, even if they don\\'t have paperwork, I\\'m not convinced anything is actually going to happen to them if you call them out on it; they can easily juts move to another part of town. Y\\'all just need to be more assertive. Say no - move on. If they continue to accost you - ignore them. If they STILL don\\'t leave you alone, that\\'s when you threaten to call the cops, because who let you into my building and aren\\'t you trespassing? But it\\'s unlikely to get to that stage, because these folks know that they are preying on the confused or naive, and when you\\'re assertive they know that you know what\\'s up and they\\'re not gonna make a sale with you anyways. The second you engage them, e.g. \"can I see your paperwork?\" that gives them an opportunity. If you\\'re not going to switch your provider anyways (and you\\'re not) then why bother?

It's not like I'm pledging or anything, hopefully I'll be with some swedish girls too, we just want to know if there really is big parties and if so how do we know when/where to go? Thanks! The top reply was: Most will start Thursday when underclassmen move in. There's a social alcohol ban going on so unfortunately most parties won't be at the actual fraternity houses. Stop by the frat houses during the day and they'll let you know what's going on that night, or ask around. The parties will go on for at least 2 weeks. Walk literally anywhere by frat park and slightly east of Lincoln. With Swedish girls, you'll be able to get in anywhere There will be plenty of rush parties. Even if you aren't actually rushing, you can still check them out for a good time. Thanks man, appreciate your input, here's to a fun couple of weeks then! Some fraternities will have parties starting on Tuesday night (when some freshmen move in). But most parties will begin on Thursday night (when the rest of the freshmen move in). It will be easiest to find parties on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. But they won't be at the chapter houses. <eos> \",\n",

So if you have anything of these want to get rid of, feel free to leave me a message.

She passed her driving test last Saturday btw), I just want to be able to talk to the community.  It would be awesome to hear about all the cool stuff going on around town. I read smile politely, but I don\\'t care to create an account on their site and interact with those people. I much rather prefer reddits anonymity and fun nature. So I suppose the purpose of this post is to call for a brainstorm on how we can increase participation on this subreddit.  Word. The top reply was: It\\'s very welcoming if your post isn\\'t \"I can\\'t use the search function\" or \"Act as my adviser\" We could try being more nice to each other around here. This is a rather unwelcoming and angry subreddit, at times. /r/uiuc hangouts? It already exists, its called ECE building and siebel center These are the posts I see too often.  I also agree with the unwelcoming nature. I agree and disagree. Some of the posters on /r/uiuc could have just as easily googled their question or e-mailed their advisor/professor. However, sometimes people just like to make conversation or get input from other people. When I\\'m out with a group of friends and I ask about a class or something, they don\\'t say, \"Why are you asking us? Just ask your advisor. That\\'s what they\\'re there for. Quit wasting our time.\" Regardless, I don\\'t see why people complain about the type of questions that get asked on /r/uiuc. If you don\\'t like them, just ignore them. Don\\'t comment on them. Downvote them (if you feel the need) and move on. A few people may want to take the time to answer. There\\'s no need to bash the original poster. It\\'s not like /r/uiuc is a really high-quality subreddit anyway. Not sure why people are so particular about this. <eos> ',\n",

Dm me, reply to this, anything. [Picture of the keys.]([url link] The top reply was: It is. Took it off an old harddrive that I was wiping, thought it would make for a cool keychain. Sorry can't help, but is that a HDD rw head? If you lost it in a class and someone turn it in, the teacher will most likely email the class. Im not sure about the alternative <eos> \",\n",
              " \"<bos> I am an engineering student and taking this class as a gen-ed. Is this class easy A? The top reply was: Mehhhh Kinda I guess you should yeah. Lol @ 5 months ago Do you need to actually read the book chapters to get through the classes? Mainly tests? I think so? You are still allowed to add classes to your schedule. If there is still room in a class is it possible to switch to it? I also need a gen ed, but i don't like the one i took. Can i still switch? From what I've heard that class is really easy, you should be fine. <eos> \",\n",

              " '<bos> Hey everyone! We\\'re Project Cut, a small team of students producing a 2D action game on our own time. We\\'re looking for an artist who is as passionate about making games as we are. If you\\'d like to join us, or if you know someone who is interested in designing art for a game, please send us a PM! If you have any suggestions about connecting with art students on campus, we\\'d love to hear them too. Keep in mind that this is a student project - we\\'re doing this because we want to ship a game, not because someone is paying us. We aren\\'t looking for free labor in exchange for \"experience.\" We\\'re looking for a team member who wants to *design a game* with us. That means you own the project as much as we do. **Edit: Thanks for your help, everyone!** The top reply was: Gamebuilders is great (and it\\'s where we met in the first place), but needs artists as much as we do. Any student interested in any aspect of game development should definitely check them out, if only to meet other people who want to make games. Have you checked out gamebuilders? This is literally what they\\'re for Hey there! I\\'m a recent art grad from uiuc with a bit of expendable time on my hands. Can you PM me some information about what style you are looking for and the amount of assets you would need? A basic time frame would be nice as well, so I can see if I have enough time to help you out. If you guys need any kind of cut-scene animation or any sprite design help, I would love to help out as much as I can. Check me out [url link] Also get in touch with the folks at CUDO, especially to see if they\\'re running a 3rd round of CUDO Plays! this year. <eos> ',\n",

The top reply was: Sailing club meets Wednesday evenings for both recreational sailors and racers. We have our own fleet of 420's along with a cat and a few windsurfers. We sail from the Commodore Decatur Yacht Club, as well as race in regional college events, have social events, etc. Let me know if you want more info. Plenty of good sailors at UIUC Boneyard Creek If anyone could just tell me where there is a body of water in the C-U area, that would be great.

I have joined one RSO, but still no success. The top reply was: Get a dog take it on walks, if that doesn't work you still make 1 friend r/UnexpectedlyWholesome I don't follow rules 1 and 2 for Tinder. I'm going to be a senior without many friends too! You should try theater, I joined in with them and made close friends after just a show and have since made a ton of really great shows from doing theater. October lovers is a cool rso as well, and you should definitely check out quad day and talk with the people at the tables of something you are really interested in. <eos> \",\n",

The top reply was: All the dining halls are all you can eat, the A La Carte locations (listed above by /u/palmtree5) are pay per item. No ripoffs, just sometimes meh food. Download the UI Dining app to see the menus for each meal on a daily basis! So how is the only problem cost? It's all the same.... If you're going into a dining hall for a meal, it's all you can eat. There's no pricing of individual items there. If you're going to one of [these]([url link] that's where the items are priced individually. LAR has a lot of vegan options as well. You can look through the menus of all the dining halls [here]([url link] Be sure to change the date to one after classes have started again and maybe look at a few different days. <eos> \""
